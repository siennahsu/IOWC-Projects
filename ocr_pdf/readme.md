# Python code for OCR and PDF processing

The notebook included here is a collection of widgets to carry out OCR (only in French and German now, but feel free to add more languages) and to process PDFs. There is additionally a widget to adjust the brightness and contrasts of a collection of images. Some images will be better suited for OCR if you adjust the brightness and contrast first.

The OCR tools are:

1. OCR on a standard PDF file with single-column and standard font.
2. OCR on a collection of images with single-column and standard font.
3. OCR on a collection of images with double-column and standard font.
4. Preprocessing of a collection of images with double-column and non-standard font.

The PDF tools are:

1. Making a PDF searchable.
2. Combining a directory of ordered images into a PDF.
3. Combining a directory of ordered PDFs into a PDF.
4. Splitting a PDF into n smaller PDFs.

The detailed instructions on how to use each widget are in the notebook.
