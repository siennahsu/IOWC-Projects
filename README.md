# IOWC-Projects

This is the code archive of the [Indian Ocean World Centre at McGill University](https://indianoceanworldcentre.com/) during 2023-2024. Please contact Sienna Hsu (shih-ching.hsu@mail.mcgill.ca) if you have questions about the code. The projects included are as follows:

  - `rainfall_data`: Collection of data from the [KNMI Climate Explorer](https://climexp.knmi.nl/start.cgi?id=someone@somewhere).
  - `rainfall_selection`: Calculation of yearly and seasonal statistics of the data collected from the KNMI Climate Explorer.
  - `phyda`: Collection, statistics calculation, and graphing of data from the [Paleo Hydrodynamics Data Assimilation product (PHYDA)](https://zenodo.org/records/1198817).
  - `ocr_pdf`: Widgets for PDF file processing, OCR, and image processing.
  - `lmr`: Extraction and calculation of mean precipitation rates based on [Last Millennium Reanalysis (LMR) Project Global Climate Reconstructions Version 2](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/paleo-search/study/27850).
  - `tree_ring`: Exploratory data analysis and visualization of tree ring data from [NOAA Paleo Data Search](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/paleo-search/?dataTypeId=18).
  - `icoads_grouping`: Adding climate zone information to the ship log data from [ICOADS](https://icoads.noaa.gov/products.html). The climate zoning scheme developed here is used in `icoads_analysis` and `reanalysis`. 
  - `icoads_analysis`: Collection of data from the [NCAR Research Data Archive](https://rda.ucar.edu/) to expand the ship log data mentioned above. Statistical analysis and visualization of data.
  - `reanalysis`: Collection of data from the [NOAA-CIRES-DOE Twentieth Century Reanalysis (20CR) project](https://psl.noaa.gov/data/20thC_Rean/). Statistical analysis and visualization of data. Comparison to ICOADS data.
