At the turn of the year. Viewed from our particular colonial standpoint, the past year has, in addition to some unpleasant events, also shown some very pleasing phenomena which will serve to secure our colonial possessions in the coming years. The view has deepened, especially in professional and government circles, that the system under which the German protectorates and colonial societies have been administered or have undertaken their activities up to now requires a closer alignment with the view, which is no longer seriously contested under constitutional law, that the protectorates are overseas provinces of the German Empire. The societies see more clearly from day to day that the exercise of sovereign rights is a crippling burden for their limited resources, while the imperial government sees itself compelled step by step to take over the functions of the Imperial Protecting Power itself, in other words, to carry out the transformation of our protectorates into crown colonies in the English sense of the word. This process will be greatly facilitated by the establishment of a special department in the Foreign Office; the department can also achieve great practical significance through a particularly detailed treatment and examination of economic colonial questions if it undertakes to solve its tasks in a comprehensive sense. For much more important than the administrative and organizational questions are the economic ones concerning the production and trade of our protectorates, since an upswing in our colonial activities and a greater influx of funds to raise the natural resources of the tropics will only become apparent if significant successes are achieved everywhere, whether in trade or plantation building. The imperial government has recognized the need to make sacrifices for the economic development of East Africa through the postal steamer bill for East Africa submitted to the Federal Council, which, we confidently hope, will be approved by the Reichstag, after the Wißmann expedition has succeeded in securing this area militarily, but there is still much to be done. The system of scientific expeditions, which has already preceded the activities of traders and merchants here and there in West Africa, could lead to the establishment of scientific and commercial stations not only there, but also in East Africa, with the help of men who have a broad understanding of the commercial side of colonial development (even if they are not trained lawyers) and who could only be won over by sacrificing considerable financial resources. In addition, much more attention should be paid to researching the plant treasures of the tropics than was previously the case, not only to delight flower lovers with a few new species, but also to encourage the commercial exploitation of the products. The establishment of plantations for valuable commercial products gives rise to hopes of favorable returns here and there, but it is obvious that the experimental plantations can only be established under state management, since the companies, which must strive for a quick return on their capital, will hardly engage in the establishment of late-returning ventures, especially since they have enough to do as it is. The reasons why the state has refrained from establishing plantations itself are easy to understand, given the way in which our colonies were acquired and their status under constitutional law, but a change in these views is not impossible, even if it is unlikely. However, the establishment of experimental plantations for a purely practical purpose would not meet with the same objections. They would have to be set up in connection with the commercial-scientific stations and, being above the suspicion of dilettantism, would not degenerate into scientific sport, but would have a stimulating effect on wider circles. What has been done so far in the colonies by the societies are only weak beginnings that will wither away unless the timid capital gains the conviction that the judgment of the experts is based only on purely factual foundations gained through experience. We must emphasize again and again that economic success is the most important thing for us at the moment, that all forces should work towards achieving this goal A more secure basis than before will be created for carrying out this work through the development of military power in East Africa and South West Africa, and all colonial friends will be sincerely grateful to the Imperial Government for having intervened at the right time. With the execution of Buschiri, the East African uprising has lost its driving and organizing spirit, and we are of the opinion that, with a few interruptions, the peace that can be expected from the character of the tribes living there will be maintained in the territories now subjugated. But the conquest of Zimbodia and the opening of the Pangani-Kilimanjaro caravan route are still to come, and the southern ports still have to be forced into submission before peaceful cultural work can resume. May the opponents of our colonial policy scoff at the fact that the path of German culture in East Africa has led over corpses and devastation, we know that blood and iron have always helped against rotten conditions, and that new life will blossom from the ruins. In South-West Africa, we may be able to manage without these violent means, especially since, under the very different conditions compared to East Africa, a quite skillful but self-confident diplomacy can still achieve success despite the defeats suffered, but we also see the time approaching when it will be necessary to throw the sword into the balance in order to maintain German authority among the peoples contending for power, whether its edge is turned against the Hereros or against the predatory Namas. May the German power then be strong enough! Only then will courageous pioneers in larger numbers be able to dare to colonize the now barren and deserted places and, if luck favours us, the mineral treasures of the soil can be exploited. The situation is more favorable in Cameroon and Togo, which have developed well from the purely financial point of view of administration and have earned some of the attention of inland colonial interests, which is now absorbed by East Africa. The latter also applies to the protectorate of the New Guinea Company, for which

The time may have come to demand a steamer subsidy as soon as the lack of a good connection with the mother country would turn into an unpleasant one after an initial certain success, which cannot fail to occur with the Company's ample resources if suitable and experienced personnel are suitably selected. According to what has been said about the Marshall Islands protectorate, things are developing well there in the modest circumstances, while the Witn area is currently in a crisis, the end of which is not yet in sight, as German and English claims are competing here, although as a result of the joyfully welcomed German declaration of protection over the coast from Kweiho to Kismayn, the Germans will certainly soon gain the upper hand here if the government provides sufficient protection. In the past year we have to mourn the loss of Premier Lieutenant Tappenbeck and Dr. Wolf, who succumbed to fever as victims of their scientific profession on African soil, and possibly also that of Dr. Peters and Lieutenant von Tiedemann, who have gone missing for the time being while fulfilling a great humanitarian task. Providence, on the other hand, has favorably ruled over the fate of Emin Pasha and Stanley. The two bold men, who arrived in Bagamoyo after a memorable march from Inner Africa, were greeted joyfully by the entire civilized world. The joy over the happy rescue of the two is, of course, mixed with a face of pain at the fact that with Emin's departure from the Requatorial Province, this part of Africa is now consigned to the barbarity of the slave trade and slave hunts under the rule of the Mahdi for an unforeseeable period of time. The year 1889 also brought us the Samoa Conference and the Brussels Anti-Slavery Conference. We are not yet in a position to say whether the former achieved its purpose of bringing peace and tranquillity to Samoa; in general, its outcome was not likely to fill us with particular joy, and atonement for the German blood shed at Vailele has yet to be made. Every philanthropist will wish the anti-slavery conference well. Even if it should not be possible at the first attempt to agree upon really radical measures, because the diversity of the interests to be considered causes endless difficulties for the great work, one must nevertheless be sincerely grateful for the beginning of a common action against the slave trade in the interests of morality and Christianity, based on international law. Among the difficulties with which the Brussels Conference has to contend are the disputes over territorial issues, which are to be settled openly or covertly between the various states with interests in Africa and which do not allow any real trust to arise between them. We Germans have more reason than ever to oppose the unjustified claims of other states in Africa and to keep in mind that much of what still seems unexplored and almost worthless to us today can later become an enviable possession, that the tremendous progress of time constantly presents us with new tasks, but that our knowledge of the circumstances and our ability to conquer them is growing in a completely different way than before. One need only recall how dangerous the march to Mywapwa seemed before Wissmann made it, how even Englishmen who know East Africa well predicted the destruction of the Schutztruppe in the interior, to realize that, trusting in our own strength, we should also undertake what today still seems to many to be something monstrous, cultivation on a large scale. The more seriously we face the difficulties, the more they will recede. The German Colonial Society is called upon to work towards the great goal; in the new year it will continue to work for the realization of the colonial idea as it has done in the past, and will stand up for what it has recognized as serving colonial interests in an enlightening and leading way. The more members it has, the more active its departments are, the deeper the interest in our endeavors will take root among the people. Winning this interest is a worthwhile and rewarding task and we therefore ask our friends to continue to promote the German Colonial Society in the new year so that it can fulfill its task more and more through greater resources and membership. A letter from Emin Pasha. Mikesse, East Africa, November 26, 1889 Dear Sir, On my arrival in Usambiro, at the southern end of the Victoria Nyanza, I learned that a German expedition has been equipped to bring help to my people and myself. Allow me, therefore, to express our deepest thanks to you and all those who have taken part in this undertaking today - from the road. If I am permitted to see my fatherland again, it will in any case be a pleasant duty for me to offer you personally the expression of my heartfelt appreciation and my thanks for your generosity. I welcome the great undertaking that was planned and realized under your aegis as proof of the lively interest that is now beginning to be taken in African conditions in Germany as well, an interest that I hope will be a great blessing for these countries. My own experience has taught me only good things about the situation here - I am on German soil. I can therefore only wish that the foundations that have been laid may be built upon with great vigor, so that a building may be erected that does credit to its masters. What I can contribute to this will certainly be done with pleasure. Please accept, dear Sir, the expression of my undying gratitude and believe me to be your deeply indebted Emin. To the German Colonial Society, for the attention of the Emin Pasha Committee Berlin, Markgrafenstrasse 25.*) From the German Emin Pasha Expedition. Today we are able to provide our readers with two highly interesting reports, one by Dr. Peters, the other by Captain Lieutenant Rust. We refrain from commenting, as it would be risky to draw conclusions about the fate of the expedition from the content of the reports. It is striking that Mr. Rust, who had followed Dr. Peters except for two days' journey and stayed on the Tana River until mid-November, heard nothing of the expedition's defeat. Mr. Rust has since returned to Aden due to illness, while Mr. Borchert will have continued his journey up the Tana River. We can expect reliable and hopefully favorable information about the fate of the expedition from him in the near future. The report of Dr. Peters, which arrived on December 28, reads: Landscape Oda Boru Ruva. Two days' march from Hameje on the Kenya. September 28, 1889 I have the honor of reporting the following to the committee of the German Emin Pasha Committee: I will be brief, as I can only send this letter as far as Massa and do not know when, or even if, it will go any further. A steppe separates us from Massa, however, through which we have marched a full 72 English miles according to the pedometer, while Ravenstein's map shows only 15. Unfortunately, I have to reproach Ravenstein's map for being extraordinarily incorrect, even presumptuous. For it is truly reckless to draw things on a map that no white man has ever explored, instead of admitting that we are in unknown territory. I am convinced that the English Emin Pasha expeditions essentially failed because of this Ravenstein map. Our expedition would have almost paid for its reliance on it with ruin. The enclosed pedometer, which exactly reflects the distances we covered - 100 paces - 75 meters, 10000 paces of Mr. von Tiedemann, who carried it - 1 German mile - shows a march of 243455 paces or 26.575 miles from Rgao to Massa; from Massa to here 213500 paces or 24.35 miles. I must note that we made more detours from Rgao to Massa. On the one hand because of the more pronounced bends in the river, which the lower course of the Tana contains. Secondly, however, because we made shorter daily marches and the turning in and out from the camp site on and to the river is therefore more important on each daily march. The road leads outside the river plain with its undergrowth through the steppe. In the mornings we often had to go quite far into this road from the campsite by the river, and in the afternoons we had to work our way back to the campsite. This letter was intertwined with a letter which the managing committee of Emin Pasha's comrade had sent to Zanzibar to greet Emin Pasha and which must now be in the hands of our long-suffering compatriot.

In the middle course of the river, this became more and more the case, because the character of the river becomes decidedly steppe-like, with high edges and the accompanying forest and undergrowth becomes narrower, and sometimes even non-existent. If you take this into account, you can hardly calculate Massa as the middle between here and Rgao. And compare this with the drawing at Ravenstein This led us to our doom by a hair's breadth, because we had not stocked up on provisions on steppes like the ones we had passed through, so we suffered from hunger for 3-4 days. In this country you can neither organize expeditions nor draw maps on the basis of information, because the Mpokomo often does not know the country from himself to the next village. All information is lost in fables. Ravenstein is also wrong about the general direction of the river's course. In fact, he places the course of the river much too far to the east-west. However, up to Massa, the same course is almost consistently north, according to its basic direction, a line at northwest, from Massa to Oda, on the other hand, it is essentially northwest, and only from there west and northwest. I have always followed these directions exactly with the compass, and am waiting for my control by the localizations of Captain Lieutenant Rust. However, it has become clear to us that Massa is much more correctly determined in the French and Perth maps than by Ravenstein, who places it about 1¼ degrees of longitude too far to the west. As soon as we have Rust's recording, we will be able to produce an accurate map of the course of the Tanal from Kenya to the coast As far as the external course of the expedition is concerned, the expedition's operations up to Massa were not difficult. The actual work consisted of the survey and the procurement of kirangosis. We soon reached a certain level of skill in both, even though the English expedition marching ahead had consumed the already limited supplies in advance. The Wapokomo are a much-plagued people, on whom everything in this region feeds, and who do not keep cattle because they are stolen from them. The Arabs on the coast come up when the crops are ripe to help with the harvest, and the Suahili join in. The Somali and Maasai come plundering as soon as they think the storehouses are full! The Mpokomo, big and robust as he is, opposes all this with the tactics of the harbor, and I was often reminded of my friend Lampe. He tears out: "anakimbia". We are "wato wa ngofu" people of fear, they say themselves without hesitation, and one can hardly have a feeling of pity for people whom the good Lord has equipped with such muscular arms and menacing fists as the Mpokomo, and who, with every serious or imaginary danger, give up house and home, even wife and child, to drag their miserable existence away. But what should an expedition leader do in such situations? From the coast, there was enough rooting around to incite the population to deny us food. But in the end it was very naïve and foolish to believe that we, who are masters of the land here, and if need be as far as the Arab and English coastal areas, would starve or even abandon the expedition if English-Arab intrigues tried to prevent us from buying grain. Where they did not want to sell us, we requisitioned from time to time, and not to the detriment of the Mpokomo and Gallabese population, who submitted to us throughout. The situation became much more difficult when we marched into the steppe on Monday, September 16, where there were occasional settlements of hunting Waboni, but no plantations and no people to show us the way. The Mboni is as elusive as the antelope it follows, and we didn't see it once. The guides I had taken with me from Kidore were prevented from returning as soon as I recognized the character of the country and I took them with me through the steppe, but they had travelled up the river and knew its bends, but their information about the overland route did us more harm than good. With rigorous severity, it was only after a few days that I succeeded in getting them to give us at least only such information as they were sure they could represent. September, 1½ o'clock in the afternoon, after an eight-hour march, steaming and sweltering with heat, we landed in a jungle without water instead of at the designated camp site, and I realized that we had lost the way and would certainly have to return if we did not succeed, I therefore left the command of the expedition, which soon found water, to Mr. von Tiedemann, and set out with one of my servants and a porter=headman to search for the path that the English expedition had taken a few days before us. We succeeded in discovering this trail at about 2 o'clock. I sent my servant back to the camp to inform Mr. von Tiedemann and to bring me some food and a blanket. I myself decided to follow the trail until I found a place to camp by the water. I wanted to determine a safe route for the expedition for the next day and then follow this trail to the final destination. It is very superfluous to include the description of a steppe march with the sun in the zenith line and the agony of thirst. This has happened so often, and a reader would not be able to get an idea from one description. After repeated and precise self-observation, I have come to the conclusion that the torment of thirst is most akin to the torment of suffocation. We marched until sunset on September 17, and just before dark I managed to break through the undergrowth after the river and reach it. In order to show the way to my servants who might be following, I had Nagola set fire to the forest and soon the sea of flames blazed for hours across the steppe. It was reflected in the waters of the Tana and sang me a proud lullaby as I lay down to rest, my boots under my head, the loaded double rifle in my arms, dead tired. Around 9 o'clock I was awakened by shots in the distance. I returned them, and half an hour later I was surrounded by some of my servants, who brought me my bed and some food. Mr. von Tiedemann had even packed half a bottle of champagne. Only those who have been in similar situations will understand the comfort with which I set about the work of eating and drinking. The comfort turns into exuberance and cheerfulness due to the contrast of the surroundings and the experience. At 5 o'clock the next morning I sent Nagola to the expedition to act as a guide. I myself took up the English trail again. At 10 o'clock I camped by the river and awaited the expedition. We marched that day until 3 o'clock in the afternoon. Such a march through the steppe is always hot and usually dusty, but it offers great comfort for the expedition leader. Beasts of burden and men march along steadily and without disturbing interruptions, especially as the latter do not find it very tempting to rest out of turn in the shadowless plain. Once the caravan has set off, it is up to the leader to decide where he wants to lead it or have it stop, at least until the afternoon. We begin preparations for the departure regularly at 5 o'clock in the morning, around ¾6 o'clock the porters march off under the leadership of Mr. von Tiedemann, and at 6 o'clock the camels and donkeys can follow. I leave the camp when the last piece and the last man are gone. I then stay behind until the forest has been passed and the steppe reached, where I usually ride past the pack animals to catch sight of the porters. I usually wait here twice more to let the camels pass me, and around midday I leave them behind to gradually reach the tete. This is the course of a march under normal conditions. As I have mentioned, the journey was different on the great steppe march, where I had to determine the route and therefore stopped at the Tete. The steppe of which I speak stretches from the Rgao to here, and, I am convinced, as far as Kenya, without any significant differences in its formation. It also corresponds perfectly to the description that Krapf gives of the Ukamba steppe. Mimosa and all kinds of prickly plants give the flora its character, pachyderms and antelopes the fauna, elephant and rhinoceros solitary can be found everywhere, and antelopes and gazelles can be seen in herds of up to hundreds. We have shot buffalo and zebras several times. In terms of poultry, there are ducks, snipes, guinea fowl, turkeys and a kind of ratites as well as the family of pigeons and field fowl for the kitchen. There are also pelicans, eagles, vultures and storks. Of course, with such an abundance of game, which is colossal and makes a trip here worthwhile for German hunters, there is no shortage of predators. The roar of the lions and the barking of the hyena echo around our camp every night, and we often startle the steppe dog out of its camp during the day. Panther tracks near the river and in the steppe suggest that these cats are also present in large numbers. To summarize my perceptions, in this steppe, through which we have now walked more than 200 English miles, we have nothing but a part of the great East African marginal steppe before us, which fills the entire northeast corner of the continent, surrounds Massailand and can be traced in its foothills as far as the Makata plain in Usagara.

The same would not be passable for an expedition like the present one without the Tana. But the Tana provides a rich source of life-giving water. The fact that the Tana is able to carry such rich masses of water through this singing and evaporating steppe to the Indian Ocean indicates the mightiness of the mountain masses that feed it, from which the Nile also springs to the north. Like the Nile, the Tana, albeit on a small scale, first brought a cultivated land into the desert. The Thalrinne with its alluvium is extremely fertile and densely cultivated everywhere. Where it is absent, as in Korkorro, all agriculture ceases. But on the lower course, as here, where the island-forming upper course rises (the recurring word Oda in the place names means a fork in the river in the Gallic language), there is corn, tobacco, bananas, pumpkins, beans and, in places, rice in abundance. So it is no wonder that the Wapokomo appear well-fed everywhere. They build their villages close to the river, which is usually the only road for them. In most cases, there is no road leading directly to the village, but rather the narrow path winding through dense undergrowth from the steppe ends above or below the settlement. From there, you then have to ask for mandates to reach the village, which can only be obtained by shouting for a long time. There is no other way to get to the village. They also hide their grain in caves outside the village and take it as needed. Thus the plundering of a Wapokomo village is of little satisfaction to the neighboring tribes, especially as men and women flee at the slightest sign of danger. The Wapokomo belong to the Bantu family, but are undoubtedly strongly influenced by the Galla element. Their own language is incomprehensible to anyone who knows Kisuahili. However, the Wapokomo speak almost all Kisuahili up to Massa, from Massa onwards and completely from Kidore onwards, Kigalla takes its place. Conversation often requires a transition through 5 languages (German, Kisuabili, Arabic, Somali, Kigalla). Here we are completely on Galla=ground and soil. In the sultanate of the chief Hujo, we have before us the last remnant of what was once perhaps a great state formation, of which older travelers (admittedly at the lower Tana) speak. However, Sultan Hujo himself, whom I asked about it yesterday, does not know much about it: "We have been here 100 years" (i.e. a wonderfully long time). "First we came from the north and fled from the Somalis across the Tana, then we fled north again from the Wakamba." When I pointed out to him that it was not exactly a brilliant story for a people, he said that there used to be many of them, but now he only had a few thousand men. Everything else had perished in the wars. In fact, the Wagalla here in the south are a vanishing rationality and all doomed. They, like the Wapokomo around Massa, have submitted to me. They know that I have relations with the Somali tribes and have asked me to broker a peace with them. Bearing in mind the commission I have received to establish a permanent connection with Emin Pasha, I am now setting up our first station here. The place has great advantages. First of all, the Bioher River is navigable all year round, and on the other side we are close to the Kenya region. Possible supplies would be able to organize themselves here in a great way, or rather reorganize themselves after the steppe march. Because there is plenty of food. After all, the station will pay off immediately as a buying station for ivory from Massailand and Ukamba. There is another tactical reason for me to build such a facility here. I have to keep my men busy, and yet on the other hand I cannot hurry forward so quickly, because I definitely need the barter items to be brought by Captain Rust in order to purchase and assemble my donkey expedition for the second half of the march to Emin Pasha. This is to be accomplished from the Kenya station that I intend to set up in Massailand. So I take up the matter with double the urgency. I am already writing this report in a house at our station. The main building, which is currently under construction, will contain a goods shed, saloon and two bedrooms. It will be built entirely of wood. Later, stone buildings may take its place. Everything has to be ready in three days, as I want to go to Kenya then. I leave the whole thing in the care of an Askari and a friend of mine, the Gallasultan. But what do the English have to say about all this? They are the ones who have forced me to take all my measures so far by fighting our expedition. Without them I would have marched through Ukamba with enough porters, would not have needed camels and donkeys, would not have touched the Tana region. Without them I would have had barter articles at hand and would therefore not have been forced to linger so long in the Tana region, which would have been decidedly more favorable to their interests. But did the English Tana expedition not oppose this intervention? Unfortunately, this English Tana expedition has once again come to a lamentable end. Mr. Smith had reached Kidore safely with 150 Zanzibar porters and 13 Arab soldiers, under the official blessing of the British Consulate General and with the official support of Said Chalisa. But the Somalis cared for neither official nor official protection. As Sheriff Hussein had already told me in Witu, he was at war with the British because they had shot one of his men. When Mr. Smith wanted to move here on the German bank about 8 days before my arrival in Kidore, 30 Somalis joined his expedition not far from Mituni. What happened there I can only conclude. I met a wounded man and two porters of the expedition a few days later in Massa. The latter entered my service. The Sultan of Kidore told me that Smith himself had returned "in great haste" with part of his expedition and had camped there again for two days. Then he had gone to the right bank and set off here again. This was the trail I followed five days later. I expected to find Smith and his men here. But he was not there. The people here say "amekimbi Ukambani na amerudi kwa Mombassa", "he escaped to Ukamba and returned to Mombas". The English station has also left, going down the river to Kosi Rderani. I assume that this does not mean the end of the English operations on the upper Tana; but for the time being the spoilers are gone and we can continue our expedition without interruption. We overtook the English trail by two days through forced marches. We had left Kidore 5 days after Mr. Smith and arrived 3 days after him on Saturday, September 21, at 7 o'clock in the evening, in Oda Galla, the first inhabited place in the Galla=Sultanate on the upper Tana, which in its entirety bears the name - not Korkorro, as Ravenstein states - but Oda Boru=Ruva. But it was a march after that. From Thursday onwards, the motto had to be: "What falls, falls". We marched for the success of the whole and for our lives. I won't go into the details. From Thursday onwards there was no more food, and the marches lasted from 5 o'clock in the morning until sunset. "What goes around comes around"; I taught the word to my servants. Stragglers kept arriving all Sunday, even though the river forest rose into the sky in the night from Saturday to Sunday as a sign for our people and as a landmark for the Gallas that the German Emin Pasha expedition had arrived. The last straggler, emaciated and three-quarters dead, only arrived here on Thursday, September 26. The carefreeness and tranquillity of our current situation is all the more comforting. In front of me flows the beautiful river with its lovely bays, framed by plantations and forest. It draws my gaze into the distance, where the Kenya mountain range is just beginning to loom on the horizon. Opposite, the black, white and red flag flutters on a high mast and below it our people are building the first German Emin Pasha station, to which I have taken the liberty of adding the name of the treasurer of our company and christening it "von der Heydt=Haus". Everything is full of life and activity and the cheerfulness shines from the eyes of the crew, who have food in abundance. I don't know what Providence has decreed for us. But according to human judgment, our venture is about to succeed. And then its beneficial effects will make themselves felt for the culture of Africa and for the interests of our German nation, which is opening up a wide field of work into the heart of Africa. For a long time I have not been so moved by the great aspects of our undertaking as I am now, and I can only repeat once again that I will put all my energy into carrying it out in an honorable manner. With the well-known respect and devotion of Carl Peters. Von der Heydt=Haus, October 8, 1831. P. S Unfortunately I have to add an addendum to my report. The Somali Abocca, whom I had sent downriver with our mail, returned yesterday because both banks of the river at Korkorro had been occupied by Somalis and the war was moving upriver.

We can, thank God, take such rumors with cool indifference. The Somalis, even if they wanted to, would not dare to attack us and would in any case lose out. To my regret, the Wagalla here had to learn this the day before yesterday. Immediately after writing my report, I had concluded a treaty with the Sultan Hujo, which practically placed the rule here in my hands and opened up the resources of this fertile sultanate to us for our purposes. I learned that the Sultan had been repeatedly challenged about this by his great men, just as Said Bargash had been in Zanzibar at the time. In the meantime, a number of Suahilis who had been robbed by the Wagallas and made slaves had come into contact with me. True to my duty, and in view of my small list of porters, I promised them protection and initially enrolled twelve of them in my ranks. The English had also set up two stations here. The Wagallas brought me their certificates and flags, which they burned before my eyes. But they had also burned the one English station in Galamba a fortnight ago. Smith had, as they said, thrown his loads into the second one before his escape. I decided to take this European property under my protection. The station was to be on one of the Tana Islands. On Thursday, October 3, I ordered the Sultan to send for the stationmaster. That evening he told me that he had arrived and would be with me the next morning. Friday passed without the station-keeper coming. Saturday passed with excuses. On Sunday I sent for the Sultan to come to my camp. He told me that the stationmaster had fallen ill. I immediately sent a reliable soldier under the leadership of two Gallas to the English station. My men found it robbed and half destroyed. They returned in the evening, and I sent word to the Sultan that I was convinced that he had had the English exchange articles stolen. In reply he sent a bead of apologies, a measure of honey and a measure of pembo (wine or meth). In the meantime, three of the Suahili slaves, leaving their comrades, had informed the Gallas of the intended move to my camp When I had just gone to sleep on Sunday, October 6, we were suddenly alerted from the other side of the river, the large Tana Island. Two slaves came with the news that the Wagallas had occupied their village and were beginning to drag away their young women and their property. In addition, there was a great popular consultation concerning an attack on our camp. The latter was confirmed to me afterwards by the Wagallas, who excused themselves by saying they had too much pembo, the former I had seen. Ioh decided to get in touch with the Sultan immediately, had the trumpet blown and sailed to the island in the moonlight with 30 selected men. I expressly forbade my men to shoot. I wanted to settle the points of contention with the Sultan, within his tribe, that very night. When we arrived at the sultan's houses after a three-quarter hour march, we heard wild shouting. I suddenly strode into the circle of those deliberating and squabbling, flag in hand. A spear hit the flag bearer, a second would have hit me if I hadn't dodged quickly. I tried to shoot the slinger down with my revolver, but it failed. I escaped a second spear by Hamiri, one of my captains, pulling me aside and I fell with my head on the opening of his rifle. Now I ordered fire. And as I only had eight men in the immediate vicinity, I fired six volleys, during which a number of gallas were fired. The battle lasted a total of three minutes, while it was uncertain whether my men or the Gallas would flee. (This was stated by Mr. von Tiedemann in camp; I did not think of it myself). When my actual Askaris arrived, everything was decided. In all, as Mr. von Tiedemann believes he was able to ascertain, we had fired some 50 shots. I fired 8 times. The Gallas had fled to the four winds. To my great regret, Sultan Hujo, as I learned yesterday, was shot in the stomach. I could not find any dead or wounded during the night. I ordered the protection of property and had the houses searched. I took away the Sultan's wives, as well as his relatives and some great men, as scourges. Then I marched to the slave village, where I stopped until all my people and the slaves had entered. At 12½ o'clock I was back in my camp. Yesterday I sent a galla to the Wagalla to offer them peace. I kept the girls and women here and promised extradition if the Wagalla would hand over all the Suahili slaves they had stolen. So far I have had no direct reply. When no such answer had arrived by this morning, I sent out an expedition to requisition grain. The same expedition has just returned with 7 messengers full of corn, beans, bananas and tobacco. The Wagalla have cleared all the islands. The Gallas did this so unwisely because their clever Sultan is wounded. Unfortunately, I have to act so ruthlessly because I am the one under attack and would be lost if we were to suffer a defeat here in a world of hostile elements. This is all very sad, and I must confess that I hate to write it down. But before distorted rumors reach Eurova, it is better to state that we have always been morally and physically in self-defense and that a renunciation of this self-defense would have meant a shameful renunciation of our moral and physical existence I am now having entrenchments built against the Somalis who might come from the east. I have to do this because our gun has become unusable due to damage to the breech. I leave it at the station. This station, and this is the pleasing thing in my postscript, is now finished; a beautiful, healthy house, with a village behind it and splendid land for plantations. I leave its development to the future, which for my part is uncertain and unstable. But I know that our work will continue. I am staying here longer than I would like, as Mr. von Tiedemann has been suffering from a spleen ailment for 10 days. He is on the mend and I am going to Kenya at the end of the week, God willing, where I will await news from Rust.

September 19, 1889. von Tiedemann, second lieutenant à la auito of the Dragoon Regiment of Wedell (Pomeranian) No. 11. The report of Captain Lieutenant (ret.) Rust, who arrived on December 30, reads: At the end of August I was with the loads left behind by Dr. C. Peters. C. Peters from Witu to Rgao in order to take receipt of the barter goods that were to come via Kau through the Beledsonikanal, and at the same time to attend to the procurement of boats (Miaus). The procurement of the barter goods caused a lot of frustration; the rivalry of too many participants led to disputes; soon the Beledsonikanal, which connects Kau with the Tana, did not have enough water, soon there were not enough carriers to be had, and so I only came into full possession of them on September 16. Similarly, finding boats presented unexpected difficulties; Dr. Peters had requisitioned boats in the surrounding area, and as the people knew that boats had to be bought or hired coûto quo couto, they demanded unreasonable prices. The Mijsionars present in Ngao supported the expedition to the best of their ability. Early on September 18, I was ready to start with 11 boats averaging 12 loads and 8 Somali. I received the boat people to Engatana in Ngao. - The movement of the boat, the miau (a hollowed-out tree trunk), is done by two people; one stands at the front with the pondo, a fork-shaped pole with which he pushes the boat forward,

Page 6

The second sits in the middle with the Pai (Pätschel) to steer and drive the boat when the water levels are too high for the Pondo or when the banks have to be changed to seek out the lower current. On September 19, I spent the night in Miono, on September 20 and 21 I stayed in Engatana, a larger town with a lot of cultivated land, to try to take people as far as Korkorro, but this was unsuccessful. On the 22nd I went on to Muina, where I managed to get 22 boat people for Korkorro over the next few days. I left Muina early on the 25th and reached Ndera Kosi late in the evening; although I could assume that the inhabitants were still agitated by the earlier incidents, everything was measured, the Sultan Nife behaved with dignity; he gave me a shamba (plantation) in the ravine to spend the night and visited me early on the other morning. Around noon, however, I left Rdera, passed Kiberaiga, Keradja and larger places, and arrived in Kenakombe at night. In Kenakombe I found the boma (fenced place) of a Mr. Schlunke, an excellent place to stay for my caravan, and the Sultan of Kenakombe was the most attentive local elder at Tana. He received me, although it was the big Matesdo (festival of joy) at the change of the moon, in the boma about 500 meters from his place, and asked for my presence at the festival. I decided to stay here for a few days, to haul loads that had become wet due to the leakage of some boats, and possibly to get a new boat for one that was taking too much water. The boma was particularly suitable for opening bales of stuff, as they were hidden from the greedy eyes of the natives. My people were all accommodated in the boma, which had about 10 leglike huts and a larger dwelling house; it was situated directly on the steep bank where the boats were moored at the same pond. - On September 29th (1st) I was struck by the hard blow that fire had broken out in the Voma; how, my diligent research has not been able to determine. It was a warm day, the sun was burning from a cloudless sky, a stiff southwest monsoon was blowing across the Bema from the opposite bank. I rushed out to the pit in the camp, I found the foremost hut in flames, the people were trying in vain to extinguish it with water brought in cooking pots; I inhibited this, a glance convinced me that the parched huts must be a prey to the flames in the wind; I ordered the recovery of the clothes spread out to dry and the dangerous loads. I had no fears for my house yet. The wind carried the fire to the next hut; here lay a Somali, Nösise Samater, who was seriously ill with dysentery; the exit seemed to be almost barricaded to him by the raging flames and it was only with great difficulty that he could be snatched from the fire by his comrades, not without suffering severe burns; Howling with pain, the poor man crawled out of the voma to seek shade and shelter in a grove of trees close by, where he was later found in the tent; I dragged him for a few more days. without being able to do anything for him when he succumbed to his suffering. The huts were soon a sea of fire, spreading an unbearable glow; but the fire was not limited to this, the roof of my house had also caught fire. Not only were valuable loads such as instruments, photographic equipment, a medicine chest, rifles and my belongings stored here, there were also several boxes of cartridges in the room. I had wisely concealed this state of affairs, but with incredible speed the flame had engulfed the whole house, the powder flew into the air, fogging the roof and showering us with a rain of fire, and now the work of rescue had come to an end. The Wapokomo jumped into the water and floated noisily down the stream to Kendkombe; I threw myself flat on the ground with some Somali and we crawled to the steep bank, where we took shelter behind the earth wall. Shot after shot, the breech-loading cartridges exploded as the thick shells burned through, causing such terror in Kenakombe that some of them ran away. It was impossible to think of approaching, bullets and breechblocks flew in all directions. It was an anxious moment to see valuable loads in the fire without being able to salvage them. I lost about 25 loads of the 120 I had with me; several loads were still damaged: the only things that could be saved from my house were the items at the entrance, including, fortunately, the hunting rifles. I was worried about the loss of the medicine chest, as there was no quinine, a conditio sino qua non in Africa. I now carried myself with the intention of waiting for Mr. Borchert, who had arrived in Lamu on 8 September; there were still over 100 loads in Ngao with which he was to follow me. The Sultan Guo came to the site of the fire soon after the accident and expressed his regret at the loss of so many precious things, some of which he would have liked to have had. The Sultan promised me that he would hold a shauri (consultation) there regarding the construction of huts, and that I should be present at it. However, the consultation was by no means unanimous but fierce and agitated and the decision was that I should wait a few more days as the people were now busy with the plantations. In the evening, the foreman of my boatmen appeared with the news that four Wopokomo had deserted and that we would not be able to sail tomorrow. I immediately suspected - and I don't think wrongly - that they wanted to take advantage of my supposed embarrassment, and my decision was now made to leave the next morning. I had the wapolomos I had left closely guarded, ordered that four of the lighter boats should be coupled together in pairs to rescue the deserters; I also sent a boat carrying the spare parts of the burnt rifles and Job's mail to Mr. Borchert with the request to replace what he could from the loads stored in Naao; another up the river to get in touch with Mr. Peters; lastly, I sent another boat up the river to the shipyard of Mr. Borchert. Peters; the latter came back down the river after four days with the two Somali, the Wapokomo had run away from them. During the night, after the excitement of the day - it was as if fate had waited for the right moment - I got my first attack of fever, and with the lack of medicine, all comforts and poor and scarce food, this treacherous illness increased to such an extent that it was to put me in serious danger. The departure the next morning was not without incident. A Wapokomo refused to drive two boats, he was roughly handled by a Somali, fell into the water and swam screaming towards Renakombe, which he thereby alarmed, so that the belligerent youths gathered at the edge of the bank with spears, bows and arrows to see what would happen. I had the boats launched and tried to go down with my boat when I saw Sultan Guo; after a brief parting of the ways, he restored calm and I bade him farewell in all friendship; but many a scowl followed me because a wapokomo had been struck. Although a little slower, my journey proceeded as usual, and I hoped to be able to replace the people in other places; I was mistaken. From now on, in order to avoid any dejertion, I had the maxim of no longer spending the night in villages; I mostly fought on protruding sandbanks or in forest clearings with the Somali by the fire. On September 26 and 27, I passed the district of Ndura; the provisions I had taken from Naao for the people were now finished and I was forced to enter into negotiations with the inhabitants of the villages to be passed during the day for food. Although Dr. Peters had informed me that I would find food everywhere after the harvest, I encountered great difficulties in obtaining it; only crops such as rice, maize and mtama came into question. Corn and mtama, the latter of which the Somali were very reluctant to eat, as they did indeed cause indigestion; it was rare to obtain a chicken or even the simple banana, which was planted in abundance, for a sick person. In such places, I always made a gift to the village chief, which many were reluctant to accept, and I also had good and suitable barter items for the Tana; but what I received was meagre, usually only for one or two days. In almost every place my Wapokomo=Dolmean was told at the first request that they had nothing, while he knew perfectly well that there were plantations in the vicinity that must have yielded plenty. Fearfully, as if they would be punished for this, they then brought some grains on energetic demand; anxiously they tried to make me hope for the next place to get rid of me, and fear was painted on their faces when I briefly declared that I would stay where I was if I had enough food. Given the inhospitality of my Wapokomo compatriots, I could take no account of their rations. They asked me to look for food myself when passing a plantation and dug up batatas and mahoao; I had to allow them to do so, but if possible, I made a gift to the local chief when passing the place. As was later pretty much confirmed, I was "boycotted". It remains to be seen whether the Wavokomo were incited to do this by spreading rumors that worried them or whether it was in retaliation for alleged misfortune. It must be taken into account here that the Wavokomo is extremely fearful, for which he has reason: the Suahili cheats him with cunning wherever he can and tries to diminish his harvest; the Galla and Somali rob him in short order by robbing him as soon as he suspects him of much. The Wapokomo also hides his surplus in the forest, and you will never find supplies piled up in one place. The fear of the Wapokomo goes so far that - at least in the smaller villages - they do not keep chickens, lest the cackling and crowing of the latter should betray them to the Gella or Somali. The villages from Kenakombe upwards are all enclosed by an enclosure of pallisades and lie on the steep bank of the river. On my approach I always found the greater part of the male inhabitants armed on the bank, and the Somali were not permitted to enter the place within the enclosure. These were the difficulties of feeding the people that I now had to deal with. Given the mood of the population, I could not even think of getting people for the boats, especially as the Wapokomo in these districts were afraid of being picked up by Galla or Somali in Korkorro and turned into slaves. Dr. Peters had been a force with his caravan, I had to operate cautiously with the small number of Somali I relied on. On September 30 and October 1, I passed through the Ndura district, always fighting from village shadows to prevent the Wapokomo from foraging. On October 2, I was in Subalini. At the English station in Kone I found a letter from Dr. Peters, who, among other things, promised me a good reception by the Sultan of Malalulu. On October 3, I reached the border of Malaluiu and the next day reached the first larger town - called Rossago by the natives. I wanted the sultan, who I was told was absent; but as I was already familiar with this kind of delivery and there was a large free beach not far from the place, I gave the order to land, still hoping for a pleasant reception. Soon a splendid sultan's figure appeared, undoubtedly very unpleasantly touched by my appearance; timidly and evasively he explained in answer to my questions that he was the "little" or "second" sultan, that the "great" sultan of Malalulu was a few hours above in another place, that he did not have enough food for so many people, but that I would certainly find it there with the sultan. As I foresee that there will be long negotiations and my Wapokomo, who otherwise never want to go any further, are also pushing, I allow myself to be persuaded to travel the few hours further up. I reach this place (Tafoma!) in the hottest midday sun; the Sultan is again not present, and I receive a very unfriendly reception. Opposite the town - which lies on the English, the right bank - stretches

Page 7

a sandbank that narrows the river to about 60 meters. I choose it as a camp site, determined to obtain supplies after my first request was met with the usual negative response. I send over 2 Somalis and the Wapokomo interpreter and ask for the local chief, as well as energetic rice, pointing out Dr. Peters' allegedly friendly relationship with them. After some time, boats appear with the "little Sultan, a gallows physiognomy, and a number of armed men; according to his report, the Sultan of Malaluln has gone into the country and is to return the next day; what is more important to me for the time being is a cord of rice and some bananas for the sick; the former, however, is hardly enough for an evening meal for the Somalis, who have been hungry for 24 hours. I let the head of the village know that if I did not have a sack of rice for my people before sunset, I would assume that he did not want to show me hospitality and that I would act on this immediately. This worked. When I fired some rockets in the evening, there was a long-lasting commotion and from the other Urer came the cries: "Peace peace!" The Wapokomo believe the flares to be glowing balls falling down. Incidentally, the Wapolomo have a great fear of fire, which is not unfounded; a single straw hut on fire would set the whole place ablaze in a short time. Since there are only a few bunkers in each place and only a narrow, low gate leads through the pallisades to the footpath, which is still mostly made as impassable as possible against enemies by traps and thorn bushes, a fire would have to put the inhabitants in grave danger, but would certainly destroy most of their possessions The following day I had to fight wherever I was, the fever had not left me for a day; I was hard hit by it. The Sultan did not appear; I would not have received him either. Early the next day I was able to pass on; it was glorious, cool weather, magnificent forest on both sides with ancient trees clothed in creepers. I enter the Malekote district and after an eight-hour journey I reach the main town of Massa, which has a large population. I land opposite Massa on a large banana plantation. The Sultan soon came over with a large escort, was very friendly and brought some bananas. I informed him of my intention to stay here for a long time, but immediately met with energetic resistance. I let the people have lunch and sought shelter from the heat of the sun myself, plagued by a severe bilious fever, under a banana tree, watched over by the Sultan and his men, who did not leave my side. At 5 o'clock we set off again, I couldn't mess things up with the mighty Sultan of Malekote, I still needed him for my provisioning. Since it was moonlight, I sailed until midnight, rubbing on a pubic boat until daybreak. - After another eight-hour journey, I came in sight of a place which the Wapokomo call Mui; a few hundred meters below I saw a clearing in the forest where a small boma used to stand; this is my place; I let them land, carry me up and lay me down on a mat, for I am so weak that I cannot walk without help. It is not long before the Sultan arrives, a stolid face, accompanied by some of the inhabitants; I give the Sultan a present and ask him to come back tomorrow, as I am very ill; he crouches at my feet with a motionless face, and my feverish imagination paints him as a hideous idol; I shout at him to leave, and he remains motionless at my feet. In the meantime the place had filled up with armed Wapokomo, more than I thought was necessary for our safety, and I had it cleared by the Somali, and my Sultan, who was guarding me, also had to give in. They then rowed to the other side opposite me, where an agitated consultation took place, during which they probably severely reproached their chosen local chief for lack of energy; finally they returned to Mul and I stayed there. Under the direction of my Somali, the Wapokomo immediately began to build me a spacious hut with a firm resting bed, which I had missed for a long time, and I gave my orders regarding securing the playe, which was exposed to the rear, and conserving the loads rc. While rummaging around, the Somalis found some sacks of mtama in the hiding place; the feared discovery of these was probably one of the reasons for Mui's excitement; I gad to exchange articles for them, the Sultan must have found himself in them, for they were too welcome to us. Now came a time of which I know little. For days I lay unconscious, I was unable to rise, and ate only sparingly. It must have been about the middle of October when I received word from Dr. Peters. He correctly guessed that I was in Malekote and urgently advised me to make provisions for about twelve days, as I could find no inhabited place between Malekote and the village of Korkorro. But where to make provisions? I had already sent the most skilled of my Somali with Wapokomo to Massa twice with barter items of all kinds; they brought me little; the Sultan refused to give me large quantities of leather goods. - Jo found myself in a dilemma that I could only count on unforeseen fortunate coincidences to solve. - Hunting requires time, which is better spent marching, and is strenuous; it requires an unweakened body, so you have to have experts who have traveled through the barra (the vast country in contrast to the forest and the cultivated land) and know the state of the game. Only the Waboni, this hunter from youth, roams these desolate lands for the ivory. -. I must have lain listless for two weeks or so, when an unexpected turn for the better came and I was on my feet again in another week. - In the meantime, I had not been spared any trouble: sunf Wapokomo had escaped, and despite diligent pursuit, none had been caught. Somalis claimed that they had known the way to Mui and had found shelter there. - I had again sent to Massa for food and boatmen, the latter being impossible; now I decided that Mui should pay its tribute if it favored my runaways. I sailed the few hundred meters upstream and entered the village with my cover; I found the same stupid face in the assembly hall that I had seen three weeks ago in the fever and which showed no interest at all in my recovery. I let him know my demand regarding the 5 boatmen, promised good payment. treatment and a safe return to Malekote and alluded to the not unlikely fate of my runaways. As he could not evade my demand, the answer was: the people were on the Shamba, he would have to ask them, I should wait until tomorrow, - the old farmer's trick, which I had used only too often to gain time; I insisted on having them fetched immediately. In the meantime, the consultation hall had filled up, and I noticed that Mui had more able-bodied men than I had thought; there was a heated exchange of words between them and the Sultan, and the Sultan promised to give the people. I went back with the assurance that I would return and immediately had the loads stowed in the boats. Still busy with this work, I was made aware that boats were leaving Mui; it was clear that the people wanted to save themselves and their belongings; the Sultan was at a loss for words. I immediately ordered Somalis and boatmen into 2 boats, which I followed. Our destination was a grove on the steep bank on the other side of the river. I had my Wapokomo call out to stop immediately, but it didn't work and I fired a warning shot at the boat about 800 meters away, but this was only the signal to row harder Mul, which I passed, was completely deserted. In the meantime, the boats landed on the steep bank and the Wapokomo were so indifferent to the danger threatening them that they wanted to extinguish their boats. The Somali now began to fire, one man was drowned and fell into the water; the others fled. There was no chance of a pursuit in the water, but I drove back. Courage was deadly quiet, no means of transportation to be found, probably hidden or taken away. I now had to count on the means at my disposal; 8 boats were coupled together, 2 each, because I could only muster 9 Wapokomo, and manned with 2 men each; the Somali had to help. I urged the Somali to be extremely frugal with the provisions, as they only had 1 sack (misko) of rice. So I left on October 30th, all circumstances urging me to reunite with Dr. Peters as soon as possible. The Tana, as I had got to know it so far, had not caused any extraordinary difficulties; with an average current of about 2 to 3 knots, progress was not difficult. The weather had been fine so far, and fighting in the open encountered no obstacles. The south monsoon was blowing with moderate strength, the sky was clear or only slightly cloudy, the humidity of the air was about 60 percent, the temperature during the day regularly averaged 26° C. in the morning at 8 o'clock, the maximum was 32° C. at noon and 24° C. in the evening at 8 o'clock. The nights, however, were very different in temperature, at home the thermometer fell to 18° C. and below, and very heavy dew was felt. As far as I could reconcile it with the purpose of my journey in the short time available, I had made observations that fully confirmed the reliability of the map drawn by the Denbardt brothers as far as Massa. - Characteristic of the Tana are its countless meanders; it makes sharp bends that change the course of the river at right angles; it runs for a few hundred meters, only to follow a different direction again, indeed, it flows back in the opposite direction to the trend of the Kuries to the east. The Tana thus runs through all the compass lines, and yet it is not without a plan. The Tana has dug its bed with difficulty; it may not have been easy for it to overcome the tough humus, to which the root system still adds its resistance. It has had to wash away giant trees and with cunning it extends its territory, undermining the banks at high tide and bringing down many a sturdy trunk in the front ranks. Where the earth holds its ground, it steers over to the other side until the resistance is once again too great and it is thrown back again; in this way, with constant twists and turns, it steers towards its destination, the ocean. On one side there are steep banks up to 5 meters high, on the other gently sloping land with banks in front. The riverbed is strewn with debris from the battle between the river and the forest, half-rotten tree trunks and older, whole trees from more recent times; soil has accumulated here. Here, soil carrying seeds has settled and formed a greening islet; there, other tree trunks have been driven up and piled into a pyramid. The Tana, which I now got to know, was no longer the calmly gliding river, it had become a torrential river with nasty whirlpools and rapids. The so-called "little rainy season" had already begun at the springs and the Tana was about 4 meters above its usual level, the current might be about 3-4 knots on average. The yellow water, although not exactly unhealthy (according to the statements; which I doubt after the dysentery cases), but not pleasant to drink, had become even more turbid. Now the consistently good weather had also come to an end, the wind became gusty and unstable, the conflict between the southwest and northeast monsoon began, heavy clouds drifted in the sky and sent tropical downpours; the day was hot, the nights very cool with an excess of dew. On the first day of my journey, death was to claim another victim, one of my sickest Somali had died; I had already met his dissolution; a comrade had carried him into his boat on his hands like a child, only skin and bones; the dysentery had wreaked such havoc after only 9 days of illness. The Semali buried him on the beach according to their ceremonial, but when he was already at rest, a doubt arose as to whether his hands were folded correctly according to the rite, and after much controversy the timbers had to be uncovered again to confirm this. I then had lunch, and was

Page 8

The mood was not depressed; death holds no terrors for the Somali; "Allah had called him too". I then continued the journey. I was now reduced to 8 Somalis, half of them afflicted by fever; but it was also gnawing at me again. In the afternoon, the rainy weather made an unpleasant appearance. I am now entering the district of Korkorro and have to cross a primeval forest which, at the usual water level of the Tana, requires about 8 days' travel, but now at least 12 days' travel to the place of the same name. Although the forest already predominates in the Malekote district, it is interrupted by human settlements and cultivated land; here only primeval vegetation. What scenery, what opulence and diversity, the trees and plants of Africa seem to have had a rendezvous here. Here is a slender tree 20-30 meters high, its leafy crown towering above the tangle, there is a tree senior, which with its branched branches and dense foliage can provide shelter for a caravan that draws the eye to itself; in between are palm trees, the dump palm, which differs from the others by its branching with fan-shaped leaves, it still bears its reddish-brown fruit, which must serve as food for the natives. Between the trees are shrubs of all kinds. Palm plants, the unpleasant holly, every place seems to be occupied, or is fought over, the bushes smother each other and the dead, pale and colorless, fertilize the ground again, which exhales the penetrating disgusting smell of the oversized journey. But no plants have gained such a firm foothold as the epiphytes and creepers; they climb up the highest trunks, the strongest are embraced by them, they run along their branches, branching out again and intertwining with each other, forming dense walls, as if to deny everyone entry, so that they alone can feed on the brand of their victims. They had already brought down some of the older ones, and the ailing forest dwellers could see that they were unsalvageable and that they would soon have to turn back to earth. At the high water level, the creepers were slithering in the water with the stream and even blocked the view into the interior; I observed a wall about 30 meters long, formed only by the creepers, a peculiar sight. Where the stream touched the bank, it had undermined it and a mighty tree with its roots still holding in its element had fallen with its crown into the water, damming it and causing insurmountable whirlpools for the boats. The night would have done credit to even a great rainy season and the boats had to constantly seek shelter under the overhanging leaves of the trees and bail out. Progress against the current was slow; Pondo and Pai are powerless where a tree that has fallen into the water forms whirlpools. If the boats cannot pass under the trunk, they have to go to the other side, which is often not without danger for boats and loads due to the many obstacles in the riverbed. The system with Pondo and Pai is actually finished by this and the river is not navigable for the Miaus, at least upstream; now and then there is nothing left for the people but to pull themselves against the current with their hands on the creepers. I travel for about 12 hours a day: the moon makes me feel better, so that I can use the cool evening hours and avoid the heat. The further up the river we go, the more obstacles become more and more domestic, trying to barricade our way. - I was already dreading the day for our night quarters in the persistent rain when, towards evening, I came across an abandoned Wapokomo village, half burnt down, where a few huts with plenty of bugs, the only domestic animal of the Wapokomo, still offered us shelter. Two of my healthy Somali had the misfortune here to fall into a game trap, a rectangular man-deep pit, which is hidden from the fish by foliage cover and the bottom of which is studded with sharp stakes; both ran such a stake through their foot as they fell in, so that it emerged again on the surface; two more sick people. For the next few days, I tormented the boats in constant torrents of rain; I had to choose my Mitiags=Bivouak in a place where there were dump palms; the Wapokomo then collected the fallen fruit for the day and at the same time I shot monkeys to feed the Wapokomo. It is a small species of monkeys - the big monkeys spurn the Wapokomo, which seem to be a tasty treat; we meet these monkeys in droves and their favorite place to stay is the dump palm, so I got 9 down from the palms in a short time. The Wapekomo scorch the skin in the fire, cut up the animal and roast the pieces of meat in the glowing ashes, after which they devour them with hot hunger. The Somali refuse one of their cooking pots to the Wapokomo; this food is not an appetizing sight for me either, but I am satisfied that the Wapokomo can be fed without difficulty, which is not the case with the Somali. Another delicacy for the Wapokomo are the large herons, which I no longer approach; the water birds have disappeared as their favorite places, the banks and islands, are under water. Pigeons are represented in 3 species, a black, green and brown taude; but they are so scarce due to the stalking of the large birds of prey circling over the forest that they are difficult to shoot. On the river I encountered neither hippos nor crocodiles, the former - an even greater delicacy of the Wapokomo than herons and monkeys - having escaped to the lower Tana and Osi rivers after the eager pursuits. The Tana is said to hold about 7 species of tasty fish, but I rarely found baskets set up to catch them. On the 7th day of the journey the Somali appeared with the news that they have nothing more to eat; I refer them to the fruit of the dump palm, there are good rations, but they stick to it and get used to it. The makomo - as the Wapokomo call it - is not unpalatable either; the somewhat fibrous flesh between the glaze-like outer shell and the stony core, which takes up most of the fruit, has a taste similar to honey, which is also what the fruit smells like. The most leggy fruits are, like our apples or pears with bee stings, those gnawed by the monkeys. My bivonak was now the forest, but apart from the protection against rain showers, it had only downsides; the soil was damp and unhealthy, a dew. We had already become accustomed to muskitos, centipedes and black ants, etc., but the large white ant, which mostly inhabited the creepers, made us want to eat some; it bit into our skin with its pincers and when we took it off, it gave off an acid that caused painful pustules. - Over the next few days the strength of the current had increased, a bool was driven back against a tree trunk, struck across and lost 6 of its loads. - On November 7, a Somali sent to me by Dr. Peters informed me that he now knew the way to Korkorro, which he could reach by land in a good day's journey; I sent him off with a second Somali, urging them to come down immediately with provisions by boat, pointing out what they had been through and that their comrades were still starving; I gave them a pressing letter to Dr. Peters on the way, which they were to have forwarded to Odaboraruva. - I gave the Somali cocoa, which they drank instead of meals. On November 10 and 11 I stayed in the bivouac after having continued my journey the previous days; I have to wait for boats that have been left behind. I give into the barra trot of my weakness and shoot a large antelope, it is cut up and the meat is taken to the camp four hours away, where there is great feasting and joy. - On November 12, I move my camp to a more open spot than before so that the expected boats and the Somali I sent do not miss me. The boat I sent out to search for the missing returns without having seen anything. At dawn I hear a shot from the opposite shore; it is the Somall of my missing boats, who had most of the much-needed barter items; he has been on foot for two days without food and it turns out that the two Wapokomo sneaked into the boats during the night from the watchtower and drifted down with the current. I immediately agree with myself to chase after the defilers and thieves with the larger part of the Somali, I leave the remaining boats at the excellent place. I gave the Somali provisions; my emissaries, about whose absence I was already wondering, are expected at any moment; Dr. Peters can then haul the loads, for which I leave instructions. I have given orders to travel day and night, and in Wakolessa del Mitole I again find one of my Somalis and my boy busy toasting me in their own way to bring me back to life; I learn that we have been in the boat for four days and four nights; it was November 17. Wakolessa, not far from Mitole, is the Sultan's shamba with a number of huts for his slaves. I informed the Sultan of the purpose of my visit and asked him to help me capture one of his subjects, whose name was known to me, and, as avarice was written all over his face, I offered him a reasonable and desirable reward if he brought back the stolen goods. My stay, however, seemed less pleasant to him. - I had sent the other boat down to Ngao to have news of Mr. Vorchert, whom I had hoped to meet on the Tana, as well as to give him such news. In the evening the Sultan appeared with some Mitole people and a band of his armed slaves; he explained to me that I could not remain in the place, and used a different language than before; I was also "boycotted" here; I forced him to give me the reasons, whereupon he claimed hostilities against the Wapokomo; I told him back that the deceitfulness of some Suttans, who did not want to keep their word, was to blame for everything, and assured him that I would stay; he left. I was in a critical situation with three Somalis and my boy and prepared to defend myself against a night raid, but it did not happen later. As I could hardly stand myself, some Somali asked me to spend the night in the boat so as not to fall into the hands of the Wapokomo; the Somali were lying on the beach directly in front of the boat at the watch fire. The next morning I sent my boy, who had always behaved skillfully, to the Sultan for food for the day, he gave us some rations of maize; although my sick body resisted, I kept quiet, because I could still count on my stay for a long time and only had a few tins of "iron" provisions. The five days in this place were among the worst of the journey; a poor diet, constant vigilance against the Wapokomo's deceitfulness and bouts of fever quickly brought my body down. I could hardly believe my eyes when on the morning of the 22nd Mr. Borchert appeared by land with my Somali to save me. I was not yet aware of my exhausted, emaciated condition, I did not know the pale color of my face, which betrayed the severely diseased liver, I thought to go up the Tana again because I thought a quick improvement depended only on quinine and a better diet; but it was too late. Mr. Vorchert, who had seen me months ago, was shocked at my present appearance. We set off at once for Kolessa, his camp, a few hours below the river, where I was clothed and fed. The Sultan did not miss the opportunity to fathom us personally, he was afraid; I ignored him. Mr. Borchert informed me of the committee's dispatch to return and the rumours about Dr. Peters' caravan; it was doubly annoying for me to have been forced to turn back by the scoundrels of the Wapokomo personally, while I could have had news of Dr. Peters in a short time.1 to 2 days' travel from Korkorro.

can. - In the evening Mr. Schlunke arrived with his boat from Ngao. The gentlemen now firmly urged me to go to Lamn and seek medical treatment, which I finally had to give in to. I asked the gentlemen to give my boats immediate succour, and gave them directions as to the places to avoid and the provisioning, which I could also manage for Mr. Borchert in Ngao. I ordered all the Somalis to Mr. Vorchert, who was also expecting some soldiers from the Sultan of Witu; he only had porters for his personal effects. Mr. Schlunke was to go by water with the most necessary loads. I now learned that Mr. Borchert's forwarding had been delayed by waiting for loads from Lamn, which Mr. Schlunke was to ship in a dhow up the Tana bin to Ngao. Mr. Schlunke had found the barrage in front of the Tana unsuitable in bad weather, he had then set his course for Kipini on the Osi River, where he had the misfortune that the dhow ran aground on a bank at the entrance, capsized and the loads were washed out in the bad weather and were lost. In the meantime, the situation had been changed by the dispatches from the committee, which Mr. Vorchert had set out to deliver to No. Peters when he met me in Mitole. In the morning I left Mr. Berchert, accompanied only by my boy, and hastened my journey to Lamn, where I arrived on November 27. - Mr. Borchert intended to leave Kolessa about the 26th of November. May he succeed in overcoming all obstacles and may he soon disprove the rumors that had spread in Lamu and Zanzibar. To complete the material, we have added a letter from Dr. Peters to his brother and a letter from Lieutenant v. Tiedemann to his father. Dr. Peters' letter was written on October 8 in Oda Borurova at the newly established station "Von der Heydt-Haus" about miles east of Kenya at 37 degrees longitude, south of the Aquator: "After a strenuous steppe march, I had initially made a treaty of friendship with the last Gallasultanate on the upper Tana (the old sabeldom Kokarra). Unfortunately, differences led to a battle, which took place at night on October 6 and in which the Gallafultan was mortally wounded. I have now made myself lord of the land here. The Gallas have all been driven out, all the villages, the entire year's harvest, eif boats, etc. have passed into my possession. When I return from my expedition, I will set up a place to live here. New difficulties keep piling up against our company. Yesterday I learned that the Somalis are coming upstream from the east, against whom I am having entrenchments thrown up. I am leaving at the end of this week for Kenya, to Kitui, where I am organizing an expedition with donkeys for the "heart" of Central Africa. I sent my mail down the Tana eight days ago last Saturday. The messenger came back yesterday because he had encountered Somali swarms. I hope this letter, which will be delivered this night, gets through. I can send you news from Kenya via Momdas and from Lake Baringo via Zanzibar. Then I will probably be gone for half a year. But don't worry. My health is quite excellent after the first fluctuation in Engatana. If this remains the case, I hope to remain master of all difficulties. The whole world is opposing this Emin Pasha expedition, and yet the German flag is flying proudly opposite me at the first German Emin Pasha station. At first everything was against me, but now at least I have food for months thanks to Sunday's law. I thank Providence which, I believe, is pursuing its own purposes in this strange expedition. Whether I perish or not, I believe I have saved the Edre, at least for the primal wedge of fair-minded men. The cries of the malicious mob are of no consequence. You know my "high regard for them. Tiedemann is not quite well and I have had the whole expedition alone for about 8-10 days. In view of the difficulty and the warlike intricacy of the situation, this gives me every cause for concern and I hardly get much sleep, as the night duty now has to be carefully controlled. I make the rounds almost several times every night. As a result, I go to bed at 8 to 9 a.m. and get up at half past 5 a.m. here too. During the ten days I have established a station here, built a "stately" house with four rooms, staked out a plantation, surveyed the Tana River up to the foot of the Kenya Plateau and procured nourishment for a hundred men for months. Now, my dear H., the sun is sinking behind the Kenya and dinner is waiting for me. Afterwards I smoke another pipe, set up the guards for the night, send the boat with this letter and then go to bed. I always eat with an appetite that is stimulating. Oit, when I have it, three chickens in one day. Beans and mashed corn straight into the soup. Bananas fried in butter and sugar for dessert. Tomorrow at four o'clock in the morning I want to make an expedition to the Wagallagediet, five hours from here, to possibly buy mutton on the run. I'm taking 40 men with me, as there could be conflicts. Even if I am confronted by hundreds, it is not dangerous, as they are only equipped with arrows and bow, but we are equipped with firearms. Give my best regards to my brothers and sisters and all my dear friends in Nuremberg! If I perish on this expedition, be convinced that you need not grieve. I will then have a happy ending and depart reconciled with the far and gladly. Meanwhile - onward and goodbye!"
On the 28th, a letter from Lieutenant von Tiedemann arrived in Bromberg, dated "Oddobarrarova (two days' journey from Hameje), September 28th", dispatched from Lamu on December 5th. "My last letter was from Engatana and now I can see the blue contours of Kenya on the north-western horizon. It has been an interesting time, but full of unhappy hardships; I have known the pangs of thirst, that I was not far from madness, surrounded by porters who, enraged by the same want, grumbled and threatened until my revolver cracked and held them in check. We had relied on Ravenstein's map, which showed Oddobarrarova lying completely in the navel near Massa, whereas in fact Massa is barely halfway between Ngao and O. We had not prepared ourselves for a march through the steppe, at least not for a march that led us for days through a desert-like wasteland without seeing a human being (literally). Had we not had two oxen with us and slaughtered one of our camels in one day, the expedition would have perished, as it did with two Englishmen before us. We are now through and feel quite comfortable here; in a few days we will leave for Kenya, Rust will follow with the baptismal articles, at least we hope so; I have not seen him since Witn, his last letter (about 3 weeks old) is from Rgao. We don't know where Borchert is. Peters and I have made our way alone, and how! There were scenes that were incredibly funny, others that were just as serious; it would go too far to describe them today, but my diary, my faithful companion, keeps a conscientious record of everything that interests my loved ones at home. When I'm back at Each later, I'll read you my adventures in the evening: how I was almost overrun by a bunch of baleberries one dark night and shot one of them, how I undertook a raid for grain with all our boats on another dark night and captured enough to feed the whole caravan for six days, how I once set fire to the forest and steppe to clear a path for the camels. I set fire to the forest and steppe and turned the whole area into a crackling, crackling sea of fire that blazed up to the sky. . . We have now left the Wapokomo behind us and are with the Wagalla, some of them beautiful boys, of deep dark color with high foreheads and eagle noses, carrying a rhinoceros skin shield on their left arm, a spear in their right hand, a large piece of americano draped around their shoulders and hips, strutting along with the air of kings. They love to adorn themselves; on their right arm they wear a broad ring of elven fine jewelry, around their neck chains of Ushanga (glass beads) and copper jewelry, finger rings are also popular. Opposite our current camp site on the other bank lies the largest village in the Gallaland landscape, Oddobarrarova, which is also the residence of King Ugo. This good man, who rules over vast stretches of land and many people, owns hundreds of slaves and a lot of other beautiful things, was initially not very accommodating, did not want to trade grain with us, forbade us to enter the other shore, in short was extremely disagreeable. The answer to this was a raid (already mentioned above), which I undertook at night and which was a great success. That impressed him enormously. The next morning an envoy appeared who made no mention of the stolen grain and shyly asked if Peter wanted war; they were asking for peace, wanted to buy everything back and so on. Now the German flag is flying over there on a long mast and our people are in the process of building a house to provide a place for the coming Rust and his goods. . .. It's hard to imagine the heat here, because we are roughly under the Aquasor. The day before yesterday and the day before that it was the worst, my thermometer only gave 45 degrees Celsius and the mercury had risen to the top of the tube, so about 50 degrees Celsius or 40 degrees in the shade. That doesn't bother me much, I hardly transpire at all, my health is undoubtedly generally great. If you receive this letter (very unlikely), then we are probably already beyond Lake Baringo and have made about a third of the journey so far. Sometimes the thought has crossed my mind, even if only temporarily: "If only I had stayed on my shores." But on the other hand, someone could baptize me and I would still leave him my post. If we carry out the expedition and reach Emin Pasha (and I am fully confident that we will), we will make the German name honorable and create a proud prestige in East Africa for a long time to come". On the back of the envelope is the following note in Oskar Borchert's hand: "I am receiving this letter on my way to Dr. Peters and his son. I am sending it to the coast by a safe messenger and hopefully it will come into your possession. Your son, whom I am very pleased to see again soon, is, as I understand from the messenger, doing well, as is Dr. Peters. Please don't believe the scare rumors! Some suggestions for practical colonization in the protectorate of the New Guinea Company. By Dr. Richard Hindorf. New Guinea! Beautiful New Guinea, which has become so dear to me! How often and how fondly I think back to you! How I am sometimes gripped by a silent longing for your lush forests, your green islands, your song-filled valleys and the richly shaped mountain ranges that surround them, towering up into gigantic masses in the blue, misty distance!

How pleasant are the memories of so many small occurrences, always changing, new, unwept, which life in a young coionie offers in such rich abundance, and which give it such a peculiar charm! Illness, disappointment and sadness are not to be forgotten. Disappointment and sadness have not been absent; but fortunately we quickly forget the bad and enjoy the good for longer. The prize for which we are fighting is too great to be won without effort, danger and loss. For if I were you. New Gurnea, compare it with the most beautiful I have seen in the tropics, with Java, Sumatra, or with the Garden of God in Ceylon, you are as brilliant in the glory and splendor of your nature as they are. But you have one advantage for me over all of them: you are German, you belong to us, and what we do for you, we do for the benefit and piety of your fatherland. But in New Guinea one has so far searched in vain for the blessed traces of the industrious human hand. In those other colonies, pondy meadows show us what a blessing they can be to the industrious farmer; everywhere there, the art of man in alliance with the bountiful nature has created such lovely, so enchantingly beautiful plants through dense shade trees, palm trees and ferns, through flower and leaf decorations, that only here can we see what beauties the tropical plant world is capable of producing. However, we may hope that the success of human activity will soon become generally apparent in New Guinea as well. German diligence, German energy and German tenacity will show what they are capable of achieving here. After all, we Germans have also achieved great things in other tropical colonies (we may not consider non-tropical colonies here) as pioneers and promoters of culture! Our work in our own country will be all the more successful. There is no doubt in my mind that New Gutnca is a magnificent land endowed with rich treasures tin land, destined one day to become as rich a colony as Java, that pearl of the Dutch crown. But it will still take us a lot of effort and work and many sacrifices before we get that far; our task is not easy. - A year and a half of work in New Gulnea made me realize that under the present circumstances a fruitful development of the colony on a large scale, guaranteeing success, was not possible. Investigations into the reasons for this, as well as the study of the development conditions in the various Australian colonies, but especially in English India, Java and Sumatra, have given me many pointers as to how the conditions in New Guinea could be organized more rationally. In the following I would like to share with you some of the results of my observations and, following on from this, to make suggestions as to how I believe practical colonization in New Guinea should be initiated The protected territory of the New Guinea Company is a country that has been best endowed by nature. Fertile soil, abundant and fairly evenly distributed rainfall, numerous watercourses, a relatively healthy climate, many and good harbors and many other advantages promise the country a good future. Anyone who has got to know it will agree that the external conditions created by nature are the most reasonable imaginable. However, it is not and cannot be a settlement colony for Europeans because of its location so close to the Aquator; a large stream of German emigrants will never be able to be directed there. Nevertheless, buying and selling Germans will find rewarding work and earnings there, be it as civil servants, merchants or in another branch of industry, and many will be able to create a permanent, comfortable home for themselves. But the hard physical labor will always have to be done by members of other races who are better suited to the tiopic climate than we whites. And here we come to a point where New Guinca has a great deficiency, that is the lack of a sufficient indigenous population capable of performing the much human, physical labour that is permanently necessary for the colonization of the land. The successful solution of the labour question is the first condition for the possibility of a sustainable colonization of New Guinea. The labor question is not easy to solve for the other German colonies either; both East Africa and the colonies in West Africa have in common with New Guinea the lack of sufficient, constantly available labor. But it seems to me that the labor conditions in New Guinea are far less favorable than in the other Denian colonies. Without entering into a comparison, however, I will only discuss the labor conditions in New Guinea. When colonizing a new, tropical country, one will naturally first look at the indigenous population and try to recruit the necessary workers from it. The number of workers required is extraordinarily high if colonization is really to take place on a large scale. The construction of roads and other transportation facilities, as well as the public works in general, will require a great deal of manpower. In particular, however, it should be borne in mind that the tropical land requires a great deal of human labor, much more than the arable land that passes through us (I only have to remember the picking of the till and the tea leaves, and the collection of the trees), so that some larger plantations would require the running of human hands. So far, however, it has hardly been possible in New Guinea to recruit large numbers of workers from the indigenous population for the service of the New Guinea Company. For what do the few hundred hardy Ardites of the New Guinea Company want to say in comparison with the immense *) In the following, for the sake of brevity, I will simply use the term N. u. Guinea, but this always refers to the German territory of the New Guinea Company.
Colonization work, which has set itself the same task! And what difficulties it has always cost so far to recruit a new number of workers! Under the present circumstances, it will be a long time before profitable plantations can be established in New Guinea, because the first requirement, the workers, is lacking. At the same time, the population of the protected area is on average so low in the time known so far that it is unthinkable in the foreseeable future to recruit the necessary number of workers for larger plantations from the natives, even if they were to commit themselves to longer service more easily than before. Until recently, only people from some (densely populated) parts of the Bismarck Archipelago, the Solomon Islands, had entered the service of the New Guinea Company, while in Kaiser Wilhelmsland the natives only occasionally came to work on the stations, without, however, wanting to enter into a permanent employment relationship, and without being able to be brought to other stations. (For only then will they become regular workers.) A welcome advance was made in this respect about a year ago, when natives from the area around Finschhafen were also persuaded to work at the other stations for a certain period of time. However, given the low level of ardent love of our new subjects in New Gumnea and their few needs, only a small number of them are willing to serve for long periods of time. And even if this were to change greatly, the weak population would still only be able to provide relatively few workers, so few that they can hardly be taken into account for our great colonization work in New Guinea. If the available workers in New Guinea are really so few in number, are there not ways and means of developing the colony with the available labor and making it useful for the mother country? Just look at our African branches. Even without considerable numbers of Ardites having been in our direct service there, it was and is possible to maintain a lively trade between Germany and those areas. The products of local industry are sold in not inconsiderable quantities in exchange for palm oil, paimkerne, peanuts, gold dust, rubber, resins, ivory and many other things. Even if these products will only really flourish after many years of hard work, they have already had a fruitful effect on our trade and industry and have thus been of benefit to our country. Could we not proceed in a similar way in New Guinea! Could we not also establish and cultivate trade relations there, and for the time being dispense with such colonization works, which require a lot of manpower! The answer to this question is an emphatic no! With the exception of some copra in a few places in the Besmarck Archipelago, and perhaps small quantities of shield pact, the indigenous people of New Gumnea produce nothing, nothing at all, that would be of interest for wholesale trade. On the one hand, we find nothing there for export, on the other hand, the natives have nothing to buy our products with; their purchasing power is, so to speak, zero. Trade relations cannot therefore be established there at present, all the less so as easily exploitable natural resources, which the natives could be led to extract and sell to us, have not yet been found. Under these circumstances, we must therefore produce trade items ourselves in New Guinea. We will have to create export articles by means of tropical land cultivation. Furthermore, it is incumbent upon us to make the indigenous people more capable of buying, i.e. we must teach them to produce values that we can exchange for our own. to produce values that we can exchange for our goods. On the one hand, we already do this when we take the natives into our service, because by encouraging them to work and then paying them, we buy their work from them; and for the proceeds, i.e. for their wages, they can then buy goods from us again. On the other hand, we must also instruct them to independently produce all kinds of useful objects for us; and when we have thus twice taught them the ways and means by which they can acquire our goods, their need for them will gradually increase. As far as possible, we will take the natives into our service. But I have already said above that their numbers are far from sufficient for the immense amount of work that awaits us in New Guinea. Just think what it means to cotonize a country like the protectorate of the New Guinea Company! With the help of the indigenous people there, we can set up a few stations, establish plantations here and there and cultivate them, and certainly provide many things. But Germany's task in our areas of the South is not so limited. We want to make the whole country our own; we want to settle not only in a few coastal areas, but everywhere, even deep in the interior, on the loftier heights. German plantations are to be established everywhere, we want to expand the natural treasures wherever it is worthwhile. Under our guidance, millions of colored subjects are to be trained for beneficial activities; we are to fill our trade barns with their help, and a large, new field of activity is to be created for our domestic industry. And all this not in the course of many hundreds of years! Germany has lagged far enough behind in terms of foreign coionies. Now we have to make up for lost time, and to do that we have to move forward quickly. Our age is working fast and with great means. But the successes are also great, in keeping with the resources invested. And in New Guinea, too, the successes will not fail to materialize if we go about our work in the right way. I hope that in 50 years we will have a rich, prosperous colony in New Guinea and that in 50 years the German possessions in the South Seas will hopefully no longer lag behind the Sunda Islands. To achieve this goal, we must make extraordinary efforts; we must not deceive ourselves about the magnitude of our task. We will not succeed alone, we need the help of nations,

Page 11

who are better suited to the heavy physical labor in the Treyen than we are. Only a large population gives a Troven colony its main value; on the one hand, it gives us the opportunity to gain products from the London for us, on the other hand, a strong population in the colonies is a good buyer for the products of the mother country. But even if we must wish to open up the widest possible sales area for our commercial activities, we must not go too far. We must strictly adhere to the principle that everything that can be produced more cheaply in our colonies than can be imported from Germany must also be produced there. This is absolutely necessary so that we can work as cheaply as possible in the colonies, because only then can we successfully compete with other colonies that are already flourishing. In many cases, however, the original inhabitants of the tropics can farm there much more cheaply than we Europeans are able to do. In all such cases, we must strive to ensure that the indigenous population takes over the relevant tasks independently; in addition, the same business can also be carried out with advantage by Europeans at home. For the natives in the tropics, the production of food is particularly suitable; they will easily be able to produce rice, root crops, fruit, vegetables and other things for their own use and for us; the indigenous peoples are usually very adept at fishing. In addition to agriculture, the natives will also be able to successfully pursue the other branch of agriculture, livestock breeding. building stones, wick bricks, etc. must be done by the indigenous peoples, either because these jobs are not sufficiently rewarding for Europeans or because they are detrimental to their health. But we have to make even higher demands; trades must also be carried out by the natives; bricklayers, carpenters, cartwrights, noir weavers, tailors, etc., if they are natives, will as a rule be much cheaper than their European counterparts, and yet usually meet the requirements. Transport businesses of many kinds, e.g. freight vehicles, cabs, boat trips, are almost without exception in the hands of people of color in the tropics; smaller trading businesses, especially for the needs of the people, are also usually run by natives. And much more could be mentioned. As long as we do not achieve something like this in New Guinea, the colony will not pay off. If we only work there with European craftsmen; if we want to obtain everything and anything from abroad; if perhaps a replacement for a broken wagon wheel must first be prescribed from Germany, then colonization is expensive. In the beginning it was no different in New Gulnea, but hopefully we will soon have a native population there that is capable of doing everything I have mentioned above and much more. Do not say that I am asking too much for New Gninea. For my description is not a product of my imagination, but taken from existing conditions. The colored people in English and Dutch India are really doing quite a good job as craftsmen everywhere; on the other hand, a lot of other businesses are run successfully by them independently; and it is only through these relationships that the possibility has arisen here to supply the products of these countries so cheaply for the world market. The idea that the natives are forcibly taking away the work and earnings of the Europeans must of course be rejected, for it would be absurd to want to suppress the industriousness of the colored people by force at the expense of the prosperity of the colonies. So where the European cannot take up the competition, he must take a back seat. But in many cases the white man and the colored man will be able to work side by side, and both will advance. Because if the work is particularly good, they will turn to the European. Furthermore, many enterprises, if they are set up on a large scale, equipped with all the aids of modern times and managed with prudence, will bring rich profits to the European, while the colored man, working with small means and satisfied with small earnings, will also find his account When a relatively strong population that has reached a certain moderate degree of culture, as indicated above, will be present in New Guinea, then, and only then, will it be possible to create a flourishing colony there. We will then have large numbers of Ardites (men, women and children) at our disposal for plantation work, we will find the necessary labor for road, railroad and harbor construction at cheap prices; we will be able to select suitable people for service on the ships, for the police, etc., in short, the labor question will be solved in the main. But how are we to achieve all this in New Gninea? The indigenous population does not meet the demands we have to make. We must therefore introduce a population suitable for the rapid and comprehensive colonization of the country. It is not easy to do this to the extent required. I know that some people will shake their heads at my demand and consider the plan unworkable. And yet it means either following it or foregoing a fruitful colonization of New Guinea. It is not enough to import workers for a period of service of a few years, because at the end of that time they will want to return to their old homeland, and the difficulty will always remain the same. No, we must bring workers with their wives and children to New Guinea, settle them there and make them at home, and organize their lives in such a way that they do not miss their old homeland. It will be advisable to settle them in larger communities, to give them plenty of land for their rice fields, the draught animals they know for tilling them, and everything else that was necessary for their well-being in the old homeland. When those who have returned to the old country learn that their relatives are doing well in New Guinea, they will be all the more inclined to follow them. It is a difficult task to ensure that the settlers do well in the very early days, but this and the resulting costs must not be forgotten. I believe it will be well to introduce large numbers of recruited laborers at the same time as the free immigrants and to settle the immigrants near the places where the workers are to be employed; then the workers will consume part of their wages with the settlers and thus contribute to their maintenance and advancement. And then, when we have created such settlements, when everyone there can obtain the necessary food and labor for moderate pay, and when, on the other hand, some larger European enterprises already exist, then the time will have come to draw German immigrants in some numbers to New Guinea; only then will the little man be in a position to farm there and make something for himself. The existence of a sufficient native working population with a certain culture is the necessary precondition for the possibility of the progress of the smaller Curovean settlers. The small man who comes to New Guinea without means is either at the mercy of the New Guinea Company or is simply lost. Somsaaen all foodstuffs have to be imported and are therefore expensive; the settler can hardly get workers; so how is he to earn his living? First we have to bring colored settlers to New Guinea, and then the European settlers can follow. For the colonization of New Guinea there are now mainly, or actually only, two peoples who come into consideration: the Maloys and the Chinese, and of the Malavas especially the Javanese. These two peoples probably meet most of the requirements we would have to make. Many will probably reject with indignation the idea of colonizing New Guinea with Chinese. One reads so much in the newspapers about the so-called Chinese plague, about the persuasions to keep the Chinese out of the United States of North America and Australia in the future, about the low moral level of the Chinese, that many will find it incomprehensible how I can seriously recommend the introduction of the Chinese to New Guinea. There is no doubt that the Chinese are not on the same level as our moral views, but neither are the Malays, just as little as the natives of New Guinea; and we must have some kind of colored basic population in New Guinea. We Germans cannot colonize New Guinea ourselves, we must necessarily have a coloured race. In almost all tropical colonies of Europeans, they are in the minority, the Fardigen predominate significantly; but the government, the majority of officials, the larger merchants and planters, and the whole character of life in general are European. And just as well as Jndia is English and Java Dutch, New Guinea will just as well bear the stamp of Germanness, whichever colored population forms the majority there. - Incidentally, the measures taken against the Chinese in North America and Australia arise largely from circumstances that do not exist in New Guinea. There it is a question of direct competition between the Chinese and the European race; the Chinese take away the latter's domestic labor and thus their earnings, both of which the European wants to keep for himself, and he therefore tries to keep the Chinese away as a dangerous competitor. In a purely tropical colony, there will be no significant competition between Europeans and Chinese, for the Chinese tend to take on the hard and so-called menial work, the business with low earnings, while in the tropics the white man only takes on the latter occupations. He can more easily keep the Chinese away from these. To a certain extent, however, the latter, as well as the mixed-bloods later on, will take up occupations that would also be suitable for the European; they will take many things away from us, especially in small trade and crafts, and also as petty officials, as overseers and so on. But in the tropics this is not so much felt; in addition, the Chinese are cheaper to have and thus the whole colony can work more cheaply than with Europeans alone. But I have also recommended the Malays for New Guinea, and I think we should not introduce either Malays or Chinese, but both at the same time, and because the Malays are easier to govern and educate, I consider it advisable to bring Malays to New Guinea as the main population. But not just any Malays, but if possible Javanese; for they have been under European influence for a long time; they have learned a lot from the Dutch; they are skilled in all kinds of work, which they should also carry out in New Guinea; they already have more numerous needs and will therefore be more inclined to work to satisfy them than lower-ranking fellow tribesmen. In addition, however, we cannot well do without the Chinese. They are better suited than any other people to lay the first foundations for later endeavors under difficult circumstances. Where no one else would dare to start and where another would probably achieve nothing, the Chinese set to work with undaunted diligence and admirable perseverance, and in the end success crowns their efforts. I have paid particular attention to these first works of the Chinese and have found everywhere that they are doing great things as pioneers for the introduction of our culture, and I have come to the conclusion that we would do without their help in New Guinea to our own detriment. The fact that it will be easy to attract large numbers of Chinese to New Guinea also speaks in favor of introducing them. Everywhere here in the Malay Archipelago and in the South Seas where there is something to be earned, the Chinese will soon find their way there of their own accord if the door is not closed to them by force. They would also have liked to come to New Guinea if they had been allowed to; in Queensland some time ago, hundreds of Chinese waited in vain for permission to sail on the ships of the

Page 12

New Guinea Company to come to the protectorate. And I believe that all they need now is to be given easy conditions for the voyage and settlement, and they will flock here in droves. Whether the Chinese could really become a danger to New Guinea later remains to be seen; I do not really believe so, because there are many Chinese everywhere in Dutch India, but they do not pose a danger to the colony. In tropical countries with a large population, conditions are different from those in temperate America or Australia. And if it should later appear desirable to prevent an excessive immigration of Chinese, means can still be found. For with the same right that we want to exclude them from New Guinea now, we can also set a goal for their immigration later. If the United States and Australia are now restricting Chinese immigration, and if the former is even endeavoring to reduce the excessive influx of Englishmen, we shall surely have the right and the power to regulate immigration into our colonies. I do not mean that we should bring in the Chinese because we need them, and that later, when they have done for us what we wanted, we should show them the door with ingratitude. Those who are already in the country may remain there quietly and continue to develop; but if the welfare of the colony requires it, we do no injustice to anyone if we make further immigration difficult or forbid it. From a general legal point of view there can be no objection to such measures; but it might be necessary to consider whether they are advisable from a political point of view, for our trade with China might suffer if we later prohibit the immigration of Chinese. But I am of the opinion that we need not be too anxious in this respect, and that we will leave it to the future to decide whether and in what way Chinese immigration should be restricted. If New Guinea is to be colonized with Malavas or Javanese, the position which the Dutch government adopts with regard to their removal from their possessions is of importance to us. Recently Holland has forbidden the export of Javanese to foreign possessions. Despite this, the New Guinea Company has been allowed to recruit Malay workers in Java once since this ban was imposed. Since Java is very heavily populated, in some areas even overpopulated, the country will certainly not suffer any harm from the removal of a small fraction of its inhabitants. Perhaps, however, the fear of the possible dilution of the German possessions in the South Seas will cause the Dutch government not to allow the introduction of Javanese here either. In this case we would then have to try to carry out our colonization work in New Guinea with Cdinesians alone, or with Jndians or other suitable peoples in addition to them. However, if we are in a position to settle Javanese in large numbers in New Guinea, it would be highly recommended to introduce the Malay language into New Guinea in addition to German, namely the Malay language, which is spoken in all coastal towns of Java and is the main language of communication between whites and colored people in almost all of Dutch India. There are, of course, many different languages and dialects in the Malavian islands, and in the various districts the Europeans living there also speak the local language; but the language known for short as "Malavian" has become widespread and can be spoken pretty much everywhere. This Malavian has the advantage of being extraordinarily simple, easy to learn and very melodious. It would be more suitable than almost any other language to form the general means of communication in New Gainea between Germans, Malayans, Chinese and the local population. I do not dare to doubt that we will succeed in introducing German as the sole lingua franca in New Guinea. It is too difficult for that, and the observations made so far in New Guinea do not justify the expectation that the Fardigen there will learn German easily. In the whole of Dutch India, too, Dutch is spoken by the natives to an extraordinary extent, but the masters of the country are comfortable learning the language of their subjects. This is not in the least a weakness on the part of the Eurepians, but a very well justified institution for reasons of expediency. It is much easier for the Dutch to learn Malay themselves than to teach Dutch like the Malays; if they had not found their advantage in this state of things, they would probably have changed it. In the foregoing I have only sketched in a few main lines the plan which we must first follow in the colonization of New Guinea. Before it is ready for execution, it still requires the most careful consideration and elaboration. For when we bring settlers to New Guinea, we also assume full responsibility for ensuring that they find the basic conditions for their prosperity there. And this responsibility is not an easy one. We are talking about the well-being, indeed, the lives of those who, trusting in us, have followed us to a foreign country. The selection of the people, the extent to which the introduction should initially take place, the actual settlement, the ways and means by which the new settlers should initially find their livelihood, these are all points that must be carefully considered before proceeding with the practical implementation. The existing indigenous population of New Guinea must also be remembered; we do not want to displace or destroy them, but rather try to preserve them as far as possible and draw them closer to us. And later, the treatment and education of the new subjects is of the greatest importance, so that they live among themselves and with us in the right relationship, and so that the whole development of the people is steered in the right direction. In this way, many of the dangers that the character and habits of the Chinese and Malavians might bring to the colonies can be mitigated or avoided. The settlement of Germans in New Guinea will, in my opinion, be able to take place to a much greater extent than is generally believed here. We Germans, who are very lacking in tropical experience, have an exaggerated fear of the tropics in Eurova. Recently, the more correct view has begun to gain ground that life in the tropics is less beneficial to us than in the familiar climate of our homeland, but that, on the other hand, Europeans can work hard in the tropics for many years, even permanently, and enjoy good living conditions. Some regions are indeed unhealthy, and the white man must avoid them as much as possible; others again are as free from disease as the healthiest place at home. We should not be too generally afraid of the "tropical climate" as being unsuitable for us. We should not be too generally afraid of the "tropical climate" as unsuitable for us, but should consider that in different places the conditions for well-being are naturally different; we should investigate these conditions in each individual case, choose the place of our settlement according to the result, and arrange ourselves accordingly. If this is done, we shall find that the tropics are not nearly so dangerous as they are made out to be, and so the unjustified fear of them will gradually diminish. Of course, the conditions for the settlement of Europeans in the tropics are even more favorable if there is no need to stay in the lowlands. It is therefore also of the greatest importance for New Guinea that larger, fertile plateaus are found in order to be able to cultivate considerable numbers of Germans on them. An elevation of only 1,000 meters already brings about a significant change in the climate; given the fertile nature of Kaiserwilhelmsland, suitable areas can certainly be found at some altitude where Europeans can live and farm just as well as in their homeland. Here the whites who live in the hot lowlands could also find recreation from time to time and gather new strength. In New Guinea, every effort should be made to reach the heights. If one is then able to settle Germans there (the first condition is to have roads from the coast to the highlands), and if tropical agriculture has been made possible by the introduction of laborers for hard work, especially for work in the open air or in the sun, then the main conditions for development in two directions are in place. But once the actual colonization has begun, the work of colonization will also progress rapidly, and New Guinea will take an undeveloped course from that point on. This is all the more to be expected as we only know the resources of New Guinea to a limited extent, and we will certainly find much that is worth exploiting in the further development of the country. Perhaps the country also harbors treasures that will bring about great development in a very short time. We can hope so, but it is not the German way to count on such vague hopes. We must examine what we have found so far with caution and certainty, and, adhering strictly to the given suspicions, draw up a plan of action. Above all, we must try to clearly recognize the difficulties that may stand in our way. Once we have recognized them, however, we will face them firmly in the Denian manner and, with the goal clearly in mind, seek to overcome them. Dangers and difficulties appear greater to those watching from afar than to those fighting them; the closer we get to them, the less frightening they tend to seem to us. Let us therefore continue to work courageously on the peaceful conquest of our colonies; we will overcome one difficulty after another. Even if success may seem almost impossible to some at home, and even if many, in fearful doubt, may consider it better to avoid the efforts and dangers of a vigorous colonization, the German people as a whole are ready to carry out the complete seizure of their colonies with all their strength and tenacity. A great task awaits us in New Guinea; to accomplish it gloriously will cost us many sacrifices, but the price of victory will be worth it. Colonial endeavors in England. By Prof. W. Schaefer. l. Farming colonies on a cooperative basis. We do not wish to speak here of the colonial policy, nor of the colonization policy of the English. By colonization policy we mean the measures taken by a government to colonize the territories already under its control, while colonial policy is the epitome of all political measures and relations of the parent country to its own and foreign territories, i.e. in a certain sense it includes colonization policy. Hübbe=Schleiden (Üderseeische Politik II. p. 13 ff.) has very well explained how both types of colonial activity, which the very name "politics" assigns preferably to the state, are nevertheless quite different in their starting points and aims. He contrasts them with the technique of colonization as a truly private matter, i.e. according to his explanation: "the sum of those experiences which concern the foundation and development of colonizing undertakings; it is the art of colonizing cultural work itself. A young colonial people, such as the unripe one, cannot yet have developed a colonization technique by itself, and since the

Page 13

Since the public opinion is infinitely more excited and occupied by the manifestations of state activity, especially when they meet the lively wishes of large sections of the population, than by the private attempts of individuals or groups, it is quite natural that the colonization technique has so far been treated only casually in our colonial-friendly press. However, the more we take our colonial policy seriously, the more each day allows our eyes to wander beyond the borders of our fatherland, the more eagerly we must occupy ourselves with the task, even if we partially renounce the more grateful political discussions, of considering the sober colonization work of the individual emigrants and, for a better understanding of our own needs, to observe even the quietest and seemingly most insignificant movements in the popular life of those nations where a certain colonization technique has already developed. We do not take the standpoint of pure usefulness, that the examples given in foreign countries should be imitated by our countrymen without further ado, but rather we regard the technique of colonization as a science which must first be lovingly cultivated in our educated circles, so that it may one day have a stimulating effect on the masses. We may be permitted for the time being to make a few loose contributions from England to this science, which will perhaps receive its systematic treatment in Germany. The well-known experience that properly formed groups of emigrants, guided from the outset by a well-planned organization, have better prospects in distant lands than individuals scattered in their new homeland, has led to a movement in England in the last year which deserves our fullest attention. Although in London alone there are 66 societies for the various purposes of emigration, even in the enterprising British Empire there do not seem to be as many well-funded societies for planned colonization as some Englishmen consider necessary, and since the existing ones have also caused frequent offence through their "land=Johbertism", the cooperative principle has been applied. A productive cooperative was conceived, based on the principles already tried and tested in individual trades and also in English agriculture, whose members were to be not only the tenants and workers eager to emigrate, but also colonial friends and capitalists as mere subscribers to share certificates, and finally even the domestic buyers of the products obtained in the future colonies, who were also to share in the profits and losses of the whole enterprise in proportion to the capital contributions they made. However, the idea of "aels-supporting emigration", which had already been proposed by Wakefield in the 1930s, was not new. In the Royal Colonial Institute, founded in London in 1868, the idea of mass emigration was repeatedly discussed by leading statesmen and experts on the colonies, and in 1881 the Member of Parliament Torrens published a colonization plan initially calculated for Canada, which Hübbe=Schleiden discusses in detail in the second volume of his "Übersecische Politik" (pp. 85 ff.). The most important aspect of Torrens' plan was "the cooperation between the governments of the mother country and the colony for the purpose of systematically using mass emigration from the former country for national colonization in the colonial country" or, as Torrens himself put it, an "Imperial and Colonial partnership in emigration". In other words, colonization with a state shell, which, incidentally, people in the country of the self-goverment do not shy away from as much as some sections of the German press like to portray it. The fact is, of course, that the large-scale state action envisaged ultimately shrank to a sum of 10,000 Lstrl. granted to the government by the English Parliament in May 1888 to support emigration to Canada.1 Furthermore, the mostly unsuccessful attempts, for example by the Englishman Richard Owen (1823) and the Frenchman Cabet (1848), to found communist communities in areas that had hitherto been little cultivated are probably to be regarded as precursors of the movement we are describing. But they were aimed at founding new states; colonization was really only a means to *) In Germany, Alexander von Bülow had already published a state socialist programme in 1849 in his work "Emigration and Colonization in the Interest of German Trade" (Verlin and Posen by Mittler & Sobn), which, however, wanted to leave the initiative and most of the implementation to the cooperatives that voluntarily formed for the colonization of any given region. An attempt made by him or the company he founded to carry out his plan in Central America failed.
The new movement, however, was not intended for the same purpose, and therefore may well reject any comparison with them, because, although not lacking in enthusiastic exaggerations of the public benefit to be created, it remains within the framework of the present state order and is essentially based on a purely commercial foundation. A Mr. W. L. Rees of Bristol, who has spent the greater part of his life in Australia, and who, by treaties with various Maori chiefs, has made available for his purposes about 300,000 acres of good arable and pasture land, together with woodlands, in the vicinity of an excellent seaport (Gisborne) in the North Island of New Zealand, wished gradually to settle this territory by groups of English emigrants. He therefore came to England with a Maori chief, Wi Pere, in the summer of the previous year and initially contacted the highly respected editor of the journal "Capital and Colonization", which had been published in London since November 1887, Mr. J. E. Cracknell. From this journal, which soon became the official organ of the co-operative movement he had started and of the "Co-operative Colonizing Association Limited", which was actually founded in February 1889, we take our information on the progress of the enterprise. Mr. Rees began his activities by giving lectures at many public meetings of the three great workers' organizations in England: the Co-operative League, the Trades Unions and the Friendly Societies, and his speeches seem to have been received with great applause everywhere. With equal success he addressed the higher circles of society, and succeeded, among other things, in being heard as an expert by the commission appointed by Parliament for the promotion of state colonies, and even the two sons-in-law of the Queen, the Marquis of Lorne and the Duke of Fise, supported him by contributions, the former also by taking the chair in individual meetings called by him. The tireless orator was also active as a writer and published a book entitled "The science of wealth in the light of the scriptures", in which he pursued a similar line of thought to that of the German clergyman R. Todt in his book "Der radikale deutsche Sozialismus und die chriftliche Gesellschaft", published in 1877, as well as a larger work with the evocative title "From poverty to plenty, or the labor question solved". In this remarkable book, he first seeks to put an end to the whole of the older so-called orthodox national economy, a second Heury George, whom he equals in some places in the brilliance of his presentation, and then develops his system of cooperative societies, which arise from the self-help of the lower classes and, through the logic of the facts, with the reasonable help of the state and the higher circles of society, ultimately encompass the whole of production. Rees would have little luck with the positive part of his remarks in Germany; not with the Social Democrats, because he places too much emphasis on self-help, which is inconvenient for them, wants to spare individualism as much as possible and is also a man of letters, and not with the rest of us, because we are not in favor of the productive cooperative, for which we probably raved 30 years ago with V. A. Huber, only to later see Schultze=Delitzsch and many others fail because of this "finest flowering" of the cooperative system, are no longer as naïve about it today as they still seem to be in England. It is almost incomprehensible to German readers how, according to the press reviews published by Rees, such a large proportion of the most respected journals in England can recognize his one-sided enthusiasm for the magic power inherent in cooperative production as a new, vital shoot on the dead tree of national economy. We are certainly somewhat ahead of the English in socio-political matters, and therefore do not need the frequent caveat that we "do not want to take the first step towards socialism" by recommending the above system, for we no longer argue about the often-prejudiced word "socialism" and, moreover, we know very well that a productive cooperative formed by the workers' self-help, if it should exceptionally flourish, is its best protection against vulgar socialism. But the author himself takes from our lips the common objection that cooperative production has so far only very poorly proved the magic power attributed to it. He admits - although we must first collect these concessions from various passages in his book and his lectures - that the cooperative movement has essentially benefited only the distributive cooperatives, the co-operative atores or consumer associations, and in Germany especially the advance associations, that in England from 1870-80, 224 Productive

Page 14

The author points out that, after a short period of existence, only 27 cooperatives in London and 24 in the provinces still exist, and that they gave up their common journal last year. But he refers to the splendid example of the Rochdale Pioneers, which, meeting in 1844 with 28 workers and a capital of 28 Lstr., now command millions, and the Scottisl Wholesale Saociety in Glasgow, which, starting in 1868 with a capital of 1700 Lstr., made a net profit of 60,000 Lstr. last year alone. He is well aware that the 56 productive associations supported by the conseil d'encouragement set up in France in 1849 with sums of 3,000 to 200,000 francs soon disappeared again, but he rightly refers to the cooperatives of pianoforte makers, bricklayers, rue St. Victor 155, etc., which flourished in Paris in the 1950s without state support, furthermore, to the complete success of the profit-sharing of their workers on the part of the printer Renquet and the house painter Leclair, as well as to the most recent creation of this kind, the much-vaunted phalanstere in Guise. If, therefore, the question is posed in this way, whether productive cooperatives are not capable of flourishing under certain circumstances, even of flourishing brilliantly, then we cannot answer it in the negative and must perhaps accept Mr. Rees' unscientific generalizations as a means of agitation intended for certain circles of readers. We must also admit that he has provided some material for the applicability of his system to colomization. However, we cannot verify his profitability calculations for the initially envisaged settlement of New Zealand. We will only note that the government of New Zealand does not seem to approve of his plans, while the press there, like the English press, warmly approves of them according to the excerpts he has published. We can only deal here with his general theoretical discussions Mr. Rees rightly points out that one of the greatest obstacles to the establishment of any productive cooperative, the initial lack of capital, is relatively the easiest to overcome by a colonial enterprise. Not only poor workers, but also small peasants, who are enabled to make some contributions by selling their possessions, join such an enterprise. It will then also be easier to find capitalists to subscribe to share certificates, not only for philanthropic reasons, because a colonial enterprise is generally regarded as more worthy of support than a printing works or factory to be founded by workers, for example, but also in view of the interest on the capital that can be expected years later, because a reasonably prosperous overseas colony will achieve prosperity much more quickly through the increase in the land rent than any commercial enterprise, which will be forced for a long time by the overwhelming competition at home to use any surpluses to consolidate the business. When Mr. Rees further emphasizes that the danger threatening the flourishing productive co-operatives that they will abandon the noble co-operative principle after reaching a certain volume of business and turn into a mammonistic joint-stock company is eliminated for colonial co-operatives by the possibility of purchasing new lands, we can leave this point alone. The same has significance for the question of whether the productive cooperative is at all suitable for eliminating the present capitalist order of production, a question which, contrary to Mr. Rees, we answer in the negative. For the present purpose, however, its discussion would be just as useless as if a penniless entrepreneur wanted to vividly imagine the dangers of wealth threatening him. As is well known, the most important objection to the productive cooperative is that it makes demands on its leaders that are generally beyond human capacity. Such a leader should not only be a well-educated businessman and a great organizer, but he must also be able to maintain a high level of popularity in accordance with the democratic constitution of the cooperative, which unfortunately is easier for popular orators than for capable businessmen. And if these rare qualities are united in one personality, he must be of an ideal selflessness in order not to exploit them as an independent entrepreneur to his own advantage, but to sacrifice them to his morally and intellectually inferior comrades who jealously insist on their equal rights. And if there is not a reasonably good spirit among the comrades themselves, even a titanic force would fail in the work. Mr. Rees' idealism is completely silent about this difficulty. On the other hand, he has provided another proof that is ultimately more conclusive than any theory. After the 12 people of both sexes sent to New Zealand as pioneers in February of last year spoke very favourably of the conditions they found in the June issue of "Capital and Colonization", Mr. Rees himself returned there to prepare the site for the first group of several hundred settlers, who may already be on their way. The basic idea was so well received in England that a second company, the "Canadian Co-operative Colonization Company Ltd.", was able to publish its prospectus in August. We can therefore wait and see whether the facts will not speak the decisive word. Decisive in the sense that success in New Zealand, even if it were not decisive for other circumstances, would nevertheless inspire other peoples with the idea of cooperative settlement, while failure in an unknown but not hopeless field would paralyze any power of action for a long time. We therefore accompany the movement in England with our warmest wishes and will gladly welcome it if its practical success should also inspire imitation in Germany. The fact that we have no New Zealand and no Canada would not be an obstacle. In southwest Africa, in Damaraland, between the Euphrates and Tigris, in southern Brazil, Paraguay, etc., large stretches of land are awaiting planned settlement by larger communities. Expert leaders would also be found in our country, and state support would be more likely in Germany than in England. We note that Mr. Rees does not disdain government assistance either. He refers to the fact (From poverty to plentv. p. 125) that Prince Bismarck had repeatedly spoken out in favour of state support for productive cooperatives: "especially when directed to colonization". This addition, however, just happened to flow from the honest Englishman's pen. In the Reichstag session of September 16, 1878, Prince Bismarck publicly declared in the course of describing his relationship with Lassalle that he still could not consider the granting of state funds to support productive cooperatives to be a mistake. He did not make the addition that was foisted on him, but we are convinced that he might well have made it, at least 10 years later, and that would ultimately be just as significant. The precondition, however, would be that a powerful, elementary movement for overseas settlement on a cooperative basis, which would inspire confidence through the personalities at its head, would assert itself in the popular circles involved, and since for the time being we have only recommended a wait-and-see approach to private initiative, we conclude today's news with the wish that at least the movement taking place in England may be followed with attention in German colonial circles. Notices from the Society. Berlin Section. On December 18, Major Liebert gave a lecture in the Architektenhaus on the basis of the recently published book by Dr. O. Baumann, which is highly recommended to our readers: "In Deutsch=Ostafrika während des Aufstandes"). We will pass over the details of the capture of Dr. Meyer and O. Baumann as common knowledge. In the opinion of Liebert, Baumann judges Buschiri too leniently with a touch of German sentimentality, because Buschiri has shown through his later atrocities that he is not a man of noble disposition and deserves his death a hundredfold. It had become less well known that the conquerors of his last camp had found many Wajarams with their hands and feet chopped off and children slowly killed over smouldering fires, and that his line of retreat had been strewn with the corpses of murdered men. With regard to Usambara, the speaker agreed with Baumann's statements that there was a very promising cultural land here, whose inhabitants could be brought to a higher cultural level after the fall of the Wakilindi, the ruling race, and the restoration of orderly conditions. In conclusion, the speaker exhorted those present to be active for the establishment of the East African steamship line, advised the formation of an Usambara society and predicted the best success for such a society. The London branch held a social meeting on December 16, in which the president, Mr. Hermann Schmidt, gave a highly interesting lecture on "the principles of politics", which penetrated into the essence of the matter. The second item on the agenda, "Subsidizing an East African steamship line", was presented by Mr. C. A. Oldemeyer. He introduced the meeting to the draft submitted to the Bundesrat concerning the establishment and maintenance of a mail steamer service. He pointed out how unfavorable it was for Germany that goods had to be shipped via England, that goods to be shipped from German East Africa often had to be turned away from ships coming from India due to lack of space. The correspondence was *) Published by G. Hölzel in Vienna. The book is well illustrated, has a very good map of Usambara and is reasonably priced.

almost tripled between 1886 and 1887. The existing branch lines were quite inadequate. In response to Mr. Oldemeper's report, which showed a great deal of expertise, the department passed the resolution already communicated in the previous issue - Forbach department. The election of the board for the year 1890 resulted in the following change compared to the previous board: The presidency has passed to Mr. Pastor Lange, the office of secretary has been placed in the hands of Mr. Saueressig, a high school teacher, while Mr. Wolter, the cash controller, will continue to exercise the functions of treasurer. - Formation of departments in Freiberg i. S., Ebingen and Balingen. On the occasion of a lecture by Dr. Neubaur on "German interests in the South Seas", a branch of our society was formed on the 18th of this month in Freiberg i. S. under the chairmanship of Mayor Beutler, and also as a result of a lecture by Lieutenant Märcker on the 15th of this month in Ebingen under the chairmanship of the factory owner Sauter and subsequently in Balingen under the chairmanship of the town schoolmaster Eisele. Mr. Oberamtmann Stamer in Balingen rendered great services to the organization of the last two sections, and the Society's management would like to take this opportunity to thank him and the other gentlemen mentioned. Minor announcements. (The handling of the dispute between England and Portugal) concerning the meeting which Major Serpa Pinto had with the Makololos at the Schire has settled down. Lord Salisbury had a note presented to the Portuguese Minister of Foreign Affairs, Barros Gomes, in which objections were raised to Portugal's pretensions in South-East Africa and the express disapproval and rejection of the Portuguese agent's actions in the Zambezi region was demanded. The note, which incidentally contains no threats whatsoever, lists the facts that England feels aggrieved by and demands the restoration of the status quo in South-East Africa. Under no circumstances could the British government allow the British flag, which had been raised by a responsible representative of England, to be taken down and removed. According to the "Reutersche Bureau" of December 25, the reply from the Portuguese Minister of Foreign Affairs, Barros Gemes, to the British Foreign Office was well received, as it expressed Portugal's fond wish to deal with the matter in a conciliatory spirit. For the time being, it will be necessary to await the official reports. We fear that a trade deal will eventually be struck between the Portuguese and the English, in which the former will concede the eastern bank of the Nyassa, while the English will receive the land west of the Shire and Nyassa in addition to a reduction in transit duties. This pretense of England towards Portugal, which has established itself in mission stations and agencies in the hinterland of the Portuguese possessions, should serve as a warning to us! - (The present situation in Brazil) is such that it is difficult to foresee what part the immigrant element is destined to take in the development of things. In general, the Germans have been friendly towards the new situation, even if here and there reserved, which is the wisest and most sensible thing to do. We are not in a position to judge whether the news of separatist movements in Rio Grande do Sul is correct. (From East Africa.) The traveler O. Ehlers left Pangani on December 27 with a detachment of the Wissmann Expeditionary Corps for Kilima-Rdscharo to deliver imperial gifts to the Prince of Moschi on behalf of His Majesty the German Emperor. It seems that the power of Simbodja is not regarded as particularly dangerous. Major Wißmann remains on the coast - Lieutenant v. Medem has died in Mpwapwa. - Consul Vohsen has arrived in Zanzibar. - (From Mr. Curt Töppen), representative of the German Witu Society and recently also of the Sultan of Witu, the "Hann. Courier" has received the following letter dated Lamu, December 5, 1889: "Mackenzie, the director of the British East African Society, and Evan Smith, the English Consul General, arrived in Lamu on November 29 on the ship "Arawatia", destined for Australia, were stuck on a sandbank until December 4 and sailed on to Zanzibar. - On November 20, the Witu=Sultan and the German Witn=Gesellschaft reintroduced the customs duties permitted by the imperial government along the coast in their territories, which of course did not go off without a little trouble. Mackenzie told the Lamn= people that these tariffs had been introduced without the permission of the English (!!!) and that he - Mackenzie - would see to it that the tariffs were lifted again by telegraph. The German consul in Sansidar has replied to a request from the English that he has no authority to have the Witn= tariffs lifted; a telegram has been sent to London, but no news has been received to date. On December 31, Mackenzie wants to have the Beledson Canal taken by force! The canal, together with all the harbors of Wituland, has been leased by the Dentsche Witugesellschaft for the purpose of collecting customs duties. However, it can hardly be assumed that the English will turn their ruthlessness against it. We are eagerly awaiting a decision on Manda and Patta; if these islands belonging to the Witn=sultans were to become English, it would be the greatest injustice. No one has any semblance of a right to them than the Rebhanids, the sedate Sulians of Witu, who have inhabited the islands for 800 years and have never given up their claims! - Mr. Clemens Denhardt, whose name the Sultan of Witu no longer wants to hear, has gone to Zanzibar with Mackenzie and wants to have all the land of the Sultan of Witu sold to Mackenzie. He has lodged a major protest with the German consulate in Zanzibar against the Witu Sultan's cession of sovereign and private rights to third parties. He is also suing the Sultan for payment of 10,000 rupees, but no justification has yet been provided. The Witn Sultan protests against all contracts which were to be published after his break with Denhardt, especially as Mr. Denhardt has not handed over his state seals to the Sultan despite his repeated complaints. Mr. Denhardt seems to imagine that the German Empire will put up with it if he sells land under German protectorate to the British for a pittance. - (Steamship subsidy for East Africa.) At its meeting on December 5, the Dresden Chamber of Commerce and Industry negotiated the establishment of a mail steamer line to East Africa to be supported by the German Reich, after the Chamber had been approached by the Dresden branch of the German Colonial Society for support of its petition to the Bundesrat regarding the steamer line. Mr. Schulze, Secretary of the Chamber of Commerce, presented the report for the first commission, in which he pointed out that the abandonment of the steamship line to East Africa had already been referred to in a petition in 1887 in the draft law on the establishment of German steamship lines at that time. Thus, the Commission, in supporting the Colonial Society's petition to the Reichstag, was only advocating the earlier position, for which much more compelling reasons could be given now than then. The inadequacy of the existing steamship connection had been sufficiently demonstrated, and trade with East Africa was capable of a significant increase. The imperial subsidy would be doubly fruitful for the empire if the planned steamship line were to extend its voyages as far as possible to Southeast Africa on the one hand and call at the port of Alexandria on the other. Madagascar and Lourenco Marquez could be considered, but the expediency of extending to Cape Town was questionable, as this world port was already in direct and excellent contact with Europe. The Commission's motion that "the Chamber should endorse the establishment of a mail steamer line from Hamburg to the east coast of Africa, to be supported by the Reich, following the relevant submission by the German Colonial Society to the German Reichstag, emphasizing the advisability of continuing the line at least as far as Delagoabal, as well as calling at the port of Alexandria, and the inappropriateness of a mere branch line from Zanzibar to Aden" was adopted unanimously. The chairman, Kommerzienrat Th. Hulzsch, also remarked that he considered the support of the Colonial Society's petition to the Reichstag to be particularly desirable because it would prove anew that, just as the vast majority of the German people in general, so especially the commercial circles of the same are still strongly prepared to support the colonial policy of the Reich Chancellor. - (The anti-slavery conference in Brussels has adjourned until mid-January. So far, the commission has dealt with the slave trade on land and the slave trade at sea, but practical results have not yet been achieved. The first commission was based on a draft by the Belgian plenipotentiary, according to which the European states were to be obliged to establish fixed stations everywhere in their African possessions, to build as many railroads as possible along the old caravan route and to establish steamer lines on the large central African rivers and lakes. However, difficulties were immediately encountered insofar as the Belgian proposal that the governments participating in the conference should be obliged to intervene against the slave trade by means of their national legislation caused concern. The powers agreed to the principle, but they demanded that each power should enact special laws that would apply to its overseas colonies. Another Belgian demand, concerning the prohibition of the import of firearms, was put aside for the time being by the Powers, even by the otherwise so philanthropic England (which had recently allowed water to be supplied to the warlike Matebele, and without the vigilance of Portugal would have provided the Shire tribes with breech-loaders at Sambest, and whose subjects were trading arms with South-West Africa via the Orange River)! The deliberations of the Maritime Commission took place on the basis of the proposals submitted by the British delegates, according to which a wide zone covering all the shores of the Indian Ocean, the coasts of the Persian Gulf, as well as those of Arabia, the Red Sea and Asia Minor, was to be established by an agreement within which the search of all Mohammedan vessels would be permitted, regardless of the flag under which they sailed. This proposal met with lively opposition from France, whose press was furious about it. The French government stuck to its well-known principle that vessels flying the French flag may not be stopped by foreign warships. Turkey wants to continue to allow the import of slaves into the Turkish-African area, but, like all other powers, it promises to prevent the export of slaves from Africa by all means and only wants the trade in white Circassians to be protected. If the provisions of its draft are accepted, the Congo State would now like to be authorized to levy import duties to cover the costs of suppressing slavery. This would, of course, overturn the Congo Act and the Niger Act would follow. We can only hope that such proposals will not be accepted, for which there is little prospect. Such a proposal would, of course, only be acceptable if it were completely

Page 16

sufficient assurance could and would be given that the proceeds of the customs duties would really and exclusively be used for the elimination of the slave trade. - (Service in Africa.) In the selection of suitable people for the protection force in Africa, particular attention has recently been paid to strong and tall people, most of whom have been taken from the active military. However, we would like to suggest that it might not be advisable to recruit the necessary crews from the young unemployed assistant hunters and assistant foresters of the state and private forestry administrations, especially since there is an extraordinary overcrowding in this profession right now. For the young Class A reserve hunter, a 1-2 year stint in Africa should seem at least as professional as a fifth or sixth year of service in the hunter battalion. Compared to other professions, young reserve hunters or young forestry and hunting officers who have been accustomed to the road from an early age, who have received a good military education in the Jäger battalion, and who are able to move in a wide variety of terrain (Stanley) and his Aegean officers wanted to leave for Agppten by mail steamer on December 30th. He has done himself a great deal of harm in the eyes of all sensible people by his desire to belittle Emin Pasha, who is unable to defend himself, to portray him as an indecisive person and even to accuse him of untruthfulness. - According to the latest news, Emin Pasha is doing somewhat better again. It is to be hoped that he could be retained for our cultural discussions in East Africa, as there are no further prospects for him in the Aegpptian service. - (From Southwest Africa.) Dr. Goering, the former Reichskommissar for the Southwest African shooting range, who was to take over the constitutional post in Portan=Prince, returns to Southwest Africa for the time being. - Lewis has arrived in England, allegedly to complain about the German encroachments. - (The French) have had some dismal experiences in their colonial policy and are now again eager to search for the shiboleth with which all difficulties can be overcome. On December 11, the Congrès colonial national convened in Paris to discuss the situation of the individual colonies and to propose means of remedying the various grievances. At the very first session, a very incisive question came up for discussion, which is also of some interest to us, namely whether the principle of "assimilation" or "antonomy" should be preferred. Senator Jsaac argued that the efforts of colonization in all territories subject to French authority should be directed towards spreading the French language, industry and customs among the natives. Several speakers objected to this, pointing to the example of India, where the English had refrained from teaching the English language because the assimilation of the native race would lead to revolutions. The Oifiziers there could not rise to the rank of captain if they did not understand the language of the country. No one wanted to use English-speaking natives as servants, as they had been corrupted by contact with European civilization. As far as the spread of French customs was concerned, one speaker asked what interest one could have in "turning the Arab world into a society similar to ours, and remarked that the Algerian natives, for example, did not want to know anything about our civilization, as they considered theirs to be more excellent". Finally, however, a resolution was adopted that efforts should be directed towards spreading the national language, industrial facilities, gradual civilization and the French spirit among the natives. (The Niger Company) replied to the accusation made to it in the White Paper in a document so curious that it is worth going into it, especially as the Niger Company undertakes to conceal the real object of the dispute. The Niger Act of 1865 is not taken as a basis, but rather the Anglo-German agreement on the delimitation of mutual spheres of interest in the Gulf of Guinca of 1886, and the two are indiscriminately mixed up. The Anglo-German agreement referred only to the political demarcation; it will not be violated by Germany either. Germany will not conclude a protective treaty with the King or Emir of Rupe, nor with any of the other Mohammedan rulers there. This territory is conceded to England, and English society may conclude treaties there as it pleases, but it must not forget that this Anglo-German agreement only became possible after the Niger Act had been adopted. To conflate the Niger Act, according to which trade and traffic on the river were declared free, with the political demarcation of the spheres of interest and to make it appear to some extent as if the Act had been abrogated by the demarcation is a rather clumsy evasion, which is easy to recognize in its hollowness. However, it will be just as impossible to undo the Niger Act as the Congo State's attempt at the Brussels Conference to amend the Congo Act in favor of the introduction of customs duties is dangerous. It is clear from this statement by the Roval Niger Company that it accused the German trader Hönigsberg of being, as it were, a political agent of the Hamburg houses, as Flegel had been in certain respects in the past; it is my opinion that it was fully justified in opposing him, since Honigoberg is said to have tried to withdraw these countries from British influence despite the political agreement between England and Germany. The attacks on Puttkamer's commissioner begin with the fact that his dolman is suspected of having distorted the answers of the Emir of Nuve out of enmity against the Company. Here, allegation stands against allegation until the report of the English Commissioner Mac Denald is available. For the time being, however, as far as Rupe is concerned, the statement of the eight traders of November 17, 1887 in Egga should be adhered to, according to which the King of Nure declared that he had never ceded any lands to anyone, which he also confirmed to v. Puttkamer in that year. The other malicious remarks that Mr. v. Puttkamer had turned out to be an agent of England, that he had so badly repaid the hospitality he had enjoyed, are quite comical when one remembers that Puttkamer had been arrested on his journey to Niger. If he was later treated kindly, this only reflects the position he occupied. Just how wrongly the Royal Niger Company viewed the whole situation, however, can be seen from the remarks made about the Hamburg merchants, according to which they were supposed to have initiated their agitation because of the high duties on spirits imposed by the Company. This English "eant" is only intended to create a mood against the Germans and to divert attention from the fact that the Niger Company, in flagrant violation of the Niger Act, has established a monopoly on the Niger which excludes all traders not belonging to it. - The Company points with a kind of fierce pride to the victory it had won over Flegel, and would like to triumph over Hönigsberg, who is far from pursuing such lofty plans as Flegel; but if Flegel's death has put an end to his plans for the time being, although his acquisitions under private law still rightly exist, Hönigsberg, on the other hand, is prepared to go out again in order to save a part of the large and promising Niger trade for Germany as well (Colonization in Witulande.) In a Munich correspondence in the Frankfurter Journal of December 18, an enterprise of Mr. Andreas Küntzel at Mandabucht was praised in a way that was not only in stark contradiction to the facts known to us, but was downright dangerous because of its exuberance. The Secretary General, Dr. Bolemeyer, therefore informed us confidentially of a letter that had been sent to the Munich department because Andreas Küngel was about to lead nine Munich gentlemen to Witulande. In this letter it was pointed out that Küntzel owned neither "plantations" at Mandabucht, but only a small shamba, nor a steamwood cutting saw there. As ardently as all colonial friends should wish that our protectorates would be opened up to economic ventures on the widest scale, the duty to oppose frivolous ventures with circumspection was urgently reminding us. As the Norddeutsche Allg. Zig. has informed its readers of this communication, we do not wish to withhold it from our readers.

The Emin Pasha expeditions. With map.*) Since the arrival of Stanley's first letter in Europe, so many publications have appeared and the subject has been covered so often in the daily papers that we would not be offering our readers anything new if we were to go into more detail about the letters, which have now been collected and published in book form. We have, however, had a small map made showing the routes of Stanley's Emin Pasha expedition, as some of Stanley's geographical discoveries are of great importance. The Aruwhimi is now known from its mouth to its source. However, as far as the existence of the great Congo forest is concerned, which is said to cover an area as large as France and the Iberian Peninsula, Stanley seems to have cut open something, as he can only report on the area he traveled through, which was largely in the vicinity of the river, which, like all waters in the tropics, was very strongly surrounded by dense primeval forests, the width of which, however, cannot yet be determined. The location of the Moon Mountains has been established beyond the slightest doubt by the expedition, and Ruvenzori, the Cloud King, has been seen; its points have been explored and some of its shoulders climbed. The "Gordon Bennett" and the "Mackinnon" are only huge shield guards, blocking access to the inner spaces of the Cloud King. The expedition discovered the Semliki flowing out of the mysterious Muta Nsige or Albert Edward Lake, as Stanley christened it, which brought the Ril source question to a definitive solution and at the same time honored the view of Ptolemy expressed 17 centuries ago. Speke, who, after making inquiries, placed the Moon Mountains in the area north of Lake Tanganyika, was therefore right; his opponents, who relegated the existence of such a mountain range to the realm of fables, were mistaken. In any case, this fact bears witness to a certain sedentariness or at least certainty of tradition among the indigenous tribes, if Ruvenzori really means Moon Mountains in the language of the natives, as Stanley assumes. From *) We have not drawn the line of retreat on our map via Tabora, although this is generally done on newer maps produced ad hoe by geographical institutes, which quickly convey the results of the larger journeys to the public with otherwise commendable speed, but have drawn the direction taken by Emin's soldiers, who conveyed letters from Stanley and Emin to Wißmann in Mywapwa. Since, according to Wißmann's report, the route taken by the soldiers was the route taken earlier by Wilson and Stanley, which led via Usurl, it seems reasonable to assume that this northern and direct, less traveled caravan route was chosen by the large caravan. This view is also supported by the fact that, as far as we know, Tabora was not mentioned in the reports, which would certainly have happened, especially as we have been missing news about the behavior of the Arabs there, which is of the greatest interest to us, for many months. It is even possible that the otherwise better route via Lavora was avoided because of the hostility of the Arabs.
On the eastern shore of the Muta River, Stanley crossed the Ankori landscape and reached Karagwe on the western shore of Lake Victoria, which he had known since 1876, avoiding the war-torn Uganda at the northern end of the lake. On the basis of his bypassing of the southern part of the Victoria Ryanza, Stanley attributes to it a considerably greater extension to the west than was previously assumed. However, a definitive calculation of his surveys must still be awaited, since, as the 9th issue of the "Verhandlungen der Gesellschaft für Erdkunde" (Negotiations of the Society for Geography) points out, the voyager's determinations of location have always been subject to substantial correction by his successors. However, these discoveries alone would be enough to give Stanley an honorable place among African travelers. The geographical discoveries of the German Emin Pasha expedition, which, according to a dispatch from Denhardt dated December 31, is on its way from Kenya to Lake Baringo according to letters from Dr. Peters, are also worthy of note; part of the course of the upper Tana has been determined, and Peters is the first to reach Kenya from the east, while Thomson is known to have come very close to it from the west and Count Teleki to have climbed it. (See No. 26 of the D. Kolon.=Ztg. 1889.) On the way to Lake Baringo, however, Peters is likely to encounter the tracks of the emissaries of the British East African Company, who have been very active in this area. Just two months after the incorporation of the company in September 1888, the first expedition was sent into the interior under Jackson's leadership, in particular to explore the area from Lake Baringo to the northern shore of the Victoria Nyanza, to set up stations there, conclude contracts and generally to explore the little-known hinterland of the coast, for knowledge of which one was still dependent on the reports of the German missionary Krapf. In April 1889, the caravan reached Machakos, on the border of Kikuyn, having come via Teita and Ulu, which had become better known through Thomson's travels, and set up a station there. This Machakos lies east of Ngongo a Bagas (about 37° E. L. and 1° F. L.), on the large inland plateau, about 7000 feet high. The caravan, which included Gedge and Dr. A. D. Mackinnon in addition to the above-mentioned, then pursued its way through the Kikuyu region, which had previously only been explored by Teleki, marching towards Lake Naivasha and Lake Baringo, and had now safely reached Lake Baringo, if not Lake Victoria Nyanza.*) A few months later, one of the company's officials, Bateman, led a caravan of supplies to Machakos Station. Another caravan set out from Malindi in the spring under the leadership of Pigott. He touched the Tana at Golbanti and went on the right bank to Massa, where he concluded treaties with the chiefs and tribes, which allegedly covered the country as far as Kenya. It is famously claimed by Englishmen that he even concluded treaties on the left bank of the Tana. Pigott found the Tana navigable for 250 English miles from the mouth and *) The information on this can be found in issue 1 of the Scottish Geographical Magazine, 1890, in a speech by General Lewis on "British and other spheres of interest", which was held at the end of November.

the Uter densely wooded. He then hoisted Klaggen of the company further up the Tana and returned to Momdas via Ulu and the Sabakiflutz. He sand, which is in agreement with Peters, that the Tana flows from the Kenig in a straight easterly direction. Two rivers come from the north above Boza, which Pigott indicates as the end point of the navigation, but whose location has not yet been determined more precisely. The third expedition was that of Mr. Smith, whose Ubercite Peters found at the Oder Tana, after the leader was supposed to have attempted to reach the Sabaki River or Mombas through Ukamba. If the British Oftafrican Company now wants to send a new expedition under the leadership of the traveler Thomson up the Tana, claiming the humanitarian purpose of coming to the aid of Peters' expedition, then this outpouring of compassion will probably have to be correctly linked to the bad news concerning the Smith expedition. Colonial endeavors in England. By Professor W. Schaefer. II. salvation of souls and colonization. When a nation is seized by a great idea, everything must serve it, and all manifestations of popular activity will have a certain connection with this idea. England's heart and pulse, however, is in her colonies, and therefore we should not be surprised that even the pious business of saving souls is placed there in the service of colonization. We are thinking here not only of the indirect successes of missionary activity in heathen lands, whose pioneering political and economic significance is probably not yet sufficiently appreciated in Germany, but rather of a peculiar means of using internal mission for the immediate purposes of colonization. By the salvation of souls in Christian countries we easily understand in philosophical Germany a prosetyte-making for one creed or another, which is not very agreeable to the finer feelings. In England, where the confectionary struggles of former times have generally given way to a great forbearance in matters of faith, the word has quite a different meaning. In the land of Manchesterism and Mammonism there are, especially in the large cities, hundreds of thousands of souls who, in their starving bodies and with every lack of any schooling, have not yet attained to the consciousness of their human destiny. The great success of the Salvation Army can only be explained by the fact that in its baroque assemblies the gospel of divine love is proclaimed to a community whose members, who had come together, had hitherto only known degradation through their own vices and the hatred and contempt of others, and who therefore, in the dark night of their consciousness, greeted with joy every ray of light that fell on their humanity. Such mass misery presents the Christian charity and the active charity of the higher classes with tasks which we in Germany would perhaps shy away from, but which, praise God, we have been spared since then, because our economic development has not yet led to a similar gulf between rich and poor and, moreover, because of the more vigorous intervention of state power for the spiritual and physical welfare of the lower classes, much more has been done. We do not wish it to be taken as a mere play on words that we are far superior to the English in one type of colonization, namely in the provision of vacation colonies. The committees which exist in almost all large German cities, and which will hopefully soon be united into a uniform organization by the "Central Office of the Summer Care Associations" in Berlin, and which enable poor children to spend a summer in the country for physical refreshment and at the same time with such beneficial consequences for their inner breeding and morals, are probably to be regarded as a more refined form of school rescue. However, this has not become as widespread in England as it has here, although the idea seems to have originated there, as V. A. Huber mentioned it in his "Travel Letters" 30 years ago. However, it cannot be denied that the greater red in England generally goes hand in hand with a greater private initiative to alleviate the misery that cries out to heaven. The charities of the better classes, maintained exclusively by voluntary contributions, show in the brightest light the charity of the better classes, combined with the practical organizational talent peculiar to the English, their ecclesiastical sense and, since the entrepreneurs have to cheer the public to ever new gifts, probably also the customary addition of commercial advertising. We

Page 19

We will only describe a few of the facilities associated with colonization here. If, as a stranger, one evening after the factories have closed, one wanders through the most formidable thoroughfare of the east end of London, the "Commercial Road", and, amidst the tumult of people and lorries, observes the pedestrians one encounters, the figures of both sexes, often clad in rags, frequently presenting the disgusting spectacle of drunkenness, especially on Saturdays, and in between the jeering street youths, offering newspapers, oranges, matches, etc. for sale, or begging in a piteous voice, then one will easily become aware of the fact that the inhabitants of other parts of the city are not so well known. etc. for sale, or begging in a piteous voice, then one will easily remember the warning often given by the inhabitants of other parts of London that one should not stray into one of the dirty side streets. But if, despite this warning, you turn into a little side street, Steyney Causeway, you will soon be captivated by the sight of a large house bearing a sign that reads: "No destitute boy or girl ever refused admission. In the midst of the street misery that surrounds us, that really is a big word. But even greater are the impressions we receive when, pushing our way through a crowd of women who want to hand over the emaciated children in their arms to free nursing care, we enter the wide business premises where a dozen hard-working correspondents and accountants are employed, and then, under expert guidance, are allowed to take a look at the many-branched organization through which about 3200 children of various ages are currently being cared for. At times sick and also incurably crippled, but most of them soon after their admission looking happily into the world, catching up on missed school lessons and church services or preparing for a middle-class profession in the various workshops, receive the same treatment as in their parents' home. This is the "Home" of Dr. T. J. Varnardo, which has been in existence for 23 years. From the magazine "Night and Day", which he publishes, and from the writings published in tract form, we see that the Home contains 31 individual institutions, many of which are located outside London for the various purposes of educating and caring for orphaned and neglected children. Two of these are in Toronto and Peterboro in southern Canada and serve as collection points for those adult pupils of the Home who volunteer to emigrate after completing their education. So far, 4050 young boys and girls between the ages of 16 and 20 have been transported to Canada to be placed, after a short stay in the Homes there, as craftsmen etc. in the cities or as agricultural servants in the countryside, depending on demand and other circumstances. Dr. Barnardo published a large number of letters of thanks he had received, from which it emerged that the resettled people were happy in their new circumstances. This is understandable, as the poor, parentless children, or those who had previously been abused by their unscrupulous parents only for begging or stealing, have no memories of their homeland apart from the strict but benevolent discipline of the Barnardo home and can easily regard any change in their fortunes as an improvement. In Canada, too, all that awaits them is a monotonous life and hard work, spiced up by good food and, what the children of vice and poverty have lacked most so far, good treatment. The recurring message in some of their letters that the farmer who had picked them up in his distant solitude had offered to call them father on the way or after a short trial period seemed quite patriarchal. The letters of her former pupils published by Miss Annie Macpherson are pervaded by the same air of grateful joy. This highly deserving lady has also set up a "Distributing Home" at Stratford in the Canadian province of Ontario and a "Farm Home" at Barnöler in Manitoba in addition to her homes in London dedicated to the inner mission. As she has an excellent representative for London in her sister, Miss Merry, she is in the habit of accompanying the pupils to Canada herself and has accommodated 4,700 poor boys and girls in 75 different departments or trips to Canada since 1868. In the pamphlets she has published, Miss Macpherson, like Dr. Barnardo, rightly rejects the accusation that she is burdening the colonies with dubious immigrants for the benefit of her homeland. She would not accept any moral objection to her "darlings", since they, although descended from the scum of London, had been cleansed of all the dross of their past in the pious and strict discipline of her home. Be that as it may, the occasional reference to criminal colonies in the English and Canadian press is probably inaccurate under all circumstances. The deportation of convicted criminals by the state, which is associated with great costs, and which must not be dispersed too far in the country of destination in order to improve surveillance, and which therefore leads to an even more concentrated "contamination" of the country, against which there is increasing resistance everywhere, is not to be compared with the less costly, voluntary emigration of half-grown children, who are on the average more accessible to better influences and still apt to be absorbed by the family life of already cultivated but sparsely populated colonies. On the contrary, it must be acknowledged from the theoretically practical results of the child exportation described above that it comes close to the ideal of a colonization that is equally satisfactory for the parent country and the colony. Just as the ideal of the national economy, which of course will never be attained in all its purity, consists in the fact that everyone develops the activity most suited to his abilities and in the place most suitable for his well-being, so the ideal of the colonization technique should be that those elements of the people are carried out which can be most easily dispensed with at home and are most expediently used in the colonies. This is generally opposed by the fact that the best elements of the best colonizers will also - individually conceived - be the homeland, but everyone must try to come to terms with this irreconcilable contradiction who does not wish to see colonies founded out of arrogance, but merely as a necessary outlet for the expansive power of the parent country. All the wisdom of colonization can only consist in mediating between the opposing interests. This mediation is possible because life in the homeland and in the colonies makes such different demands on the individual that he may well be happy to give up the former and yet be just as happy to take up the latter. In Germany, for example, we are forced to make demands on the scholarly education of our sons that are not really required by the often purely mechanical profession that follows, especially in the civil service, and law and custom sometimes prevent us from treating with a higher justice than a purely formal one a reckless prank, to which the most gifted and, through their willpower, also the most morally capable people are most likely to be tempted by their exuberant energy. The colonies, however, ask nothing about the knowledge of the Klaisiker, which is the reason for the failure of many an otherwise resourceful and bright mind, and they must also generally prefer willpower proven in outbursts of passion to so-called moral correctness, which is often only the result of inner weakness and insignificance.3) How much capable strength, highly desirable for the colonies, is contained in our numerous professional mistakes! This is not an assumption, but a fact. Almost every German village knows of a tangent who was sent to America because of his bad pranks and returned after many years as a man of accomplishment, perhaps with a somewhat prestigious manner, but also with a well-filled pocket full of honestly earned dollars. If we look at the colonizing efforts of England's internal mission from this more far-sighted point of view, which is justified by the differences in overpopulated countries and countries to be colonized, for a human material that is still so adaptable to foreign conditions due to its youth, with its habituation to hard, physical work and privations of all kinds and the moral consciousness awakened in the Homes, then we cannot doubt that the exporting and the importing country are served in the same way. The colonial tasks of the civilized peoples are so urgent and serious that the welfare of individuals, indeed of whole classes of people, must under certain circumstances take second place to the welfare of the whole. Here, however, we are not faced with this inexorable seriousness of the history of peoples, but can indulge in the unclouded joy that unfortunate human beings, for whom, through no fault of their own, the tablecloth of nature was not laid at home according to the harsh Malthusian law, have been led by helpful charity to regions where many tables are still unseated According to Hübbe-Schleiden (Überseeische Politik II. p. 64), the maintenance of the penal institutions and the military surveillance of the colonies of New South Wales and Vandiemens Land had already cost the Third Estate over 140 million marks by 1836. We fully agree with him that, despite the obvious failures of England and also Russia in Siberia, the last word has not yet been said about penal colonies in general, but we need not go into this important question any further in the above train of thought. D. B. We only fear that such people are ill-equipped to treat the native-born properly. For the initial stage of our colonial development we can only use inwardly stable people. D. R.

are. Could this not also be done for Germany? We fear no objections in principle, but the first practical difficulty that could be raised against us is that we have no colonies in which there are facilities for the temporary reception and later accommodation of new arrivals with our compatriots already resident. In No. 25 of this newspaper, however, it was reported under "Kleine Mitteilungen" from Buenos Aires) that a colony is to be founded there for the purpose of serving as a first refuge for immigrants of Germanic descent. The purpose of the enterprise is to be mainly humanitarian. Germanic immigrants, i.e. all farmers and those who want to become farmers, as well as tradesmen should be able to find immediate employment on the colony to be founded. The money to found the colony will be raised by the Association for the Protection of Germanic Immigrants in Buenos Aires by founding a joint-stock company. The colony should be the nearest place of refuge for the new immigrant, where he can find work immediately, protected against arbitrariness, receive healthy, good food for the lowest possible payment, have an experienced, disinterested advisor at his side in the administrator, not forget the German language while living with his fellow countrymen and have the opportunity to learn the national language in a school to be founded. The new immigrant to the association colony should be taught the best way of farming there and become acquainted with the laws of the country and the peculiarities of the inhabitants. If this enterprise were to come about in Argentina or a similar one in southern Brazil, perhaps in Porto Alegre, then all we would have to do from here would be to provide suitable staff. Fortunately, we do not have as many illiterate people to be snatched from the depths of moral misery as England, but we also have enough neglected people who cannot be usefully employed here, who would nevertheless be excellently suited to the professions of craftsmen and rural servants that are so much in demand in the overseas countries. And we do not need to rely on the creations of individual philanthropists, but have much better foundations for beneficial activity in the direction indicated in our state institutions, which have been transferred to the provincial administrations and are based on free association activity. For neglected but not yet punished children, there were (according to Count Huc de Grais: "Handbuch der Verfassung und Verwaltung in Preußen und dem deutschen Reich," 4th ed.) 179 rescue homes in Prussia alone in 1883, in addition to the 25 workhouses and reformatories intended for vagrants and the 7 workers' colonies, which pursue the higher goal of enabling unemployed vagabonds to return to work and a regular life as desired by themselves. We are sorry that we cannot also call upon the associations for the provision of accommodation for released convicts as allies, for many a delinquent who was led to prison only by the act of an unguarded moment and "evil misunderstanding", However, in view of the as yet untested degree of receptiveness of the countries of destination, we can for the time being only think of the inmates of the above-mentioned rescue houses and workers' colonies, for whom the administrations of these institutions can assume a certain responsibility according to their biological behavior. Perhaps a suggestion from a colonial-friendly side will suffice to enable some of these administrations to take independent action; in any case, the deserving men of our inner mission, these true doctors of the soul, will agree with us that for many of their wards a change of climate is indicated as a means of preventive hygiene and also as a remedy. Dent's urban colonization. R. v. Hale. Perhaps there are still sincere colonial friends who cannot imagine the development of German East Africa without the possession of the island of Zanzibar. If I speak here as if we could do without it completely, I am only pushing back a heartfelt wish, but I say to myself that it is better to develop the mainland without any consideration for the island than for *) We believe that the author overestimates the humanitarian side of society in its recent actions. As far as we know, the Association for the Protection of Germanic Immigrants in Buenos Aires, like the German Society in New York, is little more than an information and placement office, which, however, consists of voluntary funds. The joint-stock company, on the other hand, seems to have been founded more for the pursuit of commercial interests. I.e. a completely uncertain political event lurking, the precious years, armed to the teeth, in specifically colonizing terms, flowing by without doing anything. For if this did not give the colonial enemies a devastating weapon, we would never have had any at all. This colony of ours certainly has an immense advantage over many others in that Zanzibar is already a semi-European developed urban and commercial base for cultural endeavors of any kind. There are banks there. Warehouses and workshops But Zanzibar is not a port in the true sense of the word. Although it is somewhat protected on the ocean side by the island itself and on the mainland side by a chain of islands, it is interspersed with a strong sea current, which makes maneuvering through the closely spaced ships very dangerous, and during certain monsoons, such as in the month of November, there is such a sea in the harbor that the British India, for example, does not dare to unload, but only delivers mail and passengers, taking all goods with her to Mozambique, only to deliver them to Zanzibar six weeks later. It is therefore only a port insofar as ships can deliver goods there and re-provision after a long voyage. For larger repairs, for "docking" etc., even the Sultan's ships have to sail to Bombay. It is also unlikely that there will ever be any such facilities in Zanzibar, as the peculiar ownership situation and the lack of suitable terrain between the lagoons would make the regulation and expansion of this city in favor of spacious naval establishments very cumbersome and costly. But a sultan resides in Zanzibar and, as a result, there is a consul general there, and, in turn, representatives of German companies and firms. It is indeed very difficult to get away from Zanzibar, and so it seems more or less indispensable to everyone living in German East Africa. But for the actual German colonization, once the beginning has been made, it is not only completely superfluous, but even harmful. Every Pfennia that we carry to Zanzibar is lost to us and strengthens our competitors. It is not a natural harbor, and if we wanted to bring our goods from the mainland to Zanzibar first, it would be as much as if Bremen and Hamburg wanted to trade with the world via Heligoland. We have Dar=es=Salaam and Tanga, two splendid, spacious natural harbors. We have nothing more burning to do with our colonization than to turn these places into port cities; for so far there are neither trading companies, nor coal and goods warehouses, nor repair shops, nor inns, craftsmen and businessmen there. Admittedly, it is not the valued anchorage alone, but these facilities that make the harbor. Do we need to learn this kind of colonization first, like planting, are we still in kindergarten? I think we just need to want it! The entrepreneurial spirit of the smaller ones is drawn to where contracts are issued. "Where the kings build, the carpenters have work to do. But where do we prefer to build? Again and again in Zanzibar! A start must be made to break this spell. Let us leave the Sultan alone with his diplomats for a while. Let him come to the Reichskommissar on the mainland if he wants something from us. With 500,000 marks, all of these above-mentioned facilities are made, much better made than with which this camel-mist-scented flower of Arab cities ties us to its never yet disinfected shores. Dar=es=Salaam is perhaps the quieter harbor of the two, but Tanga is healthier, and as soon as it offers the same or more in the way of refreshment than the city of Zanzibar, no ship coming from the Suez Canal will carelessly pass through it. Our own (subsidized) line should, in time, eliminate Zanzibar altogether. Tanga is the suburb of our most important plantation lands; as it develops, it will become the suburb, and later the business successor to Zanzibar. Let's only build there when the time is right! Let us - as the German East African Society is already doing - direct all our measures and business activities towards making this Tanga into what its natural location calls for. It is very gratifying that a company is already being formed to establish the most necessary condition, a steamship connection with Zanzibar, because it goes without saying that Tanga's development must still be based on Zanzibar in the first instance. The very timely remarks of Captain U. Holtz have probably correctly outlined the local requirements for this. However, I also made inquiries on the spot about the small coastal steamers and in particular with the gentlemen mechanical engineers, because their judgment with regard to shipbuilding seemed to me to be the most reliable. What I wanted to find out was at what depth

Page 21

I will have to reckon with "a coastal railroad" to connect the coastal steamers and lighter vessels. I am sharing the average result of this survey here: the steamers should hold approx. 200 tons and travel at least 10 miles per hour. 2nd economy deck set up and an upper deck construction for approx. 10 cabin passengers, all officers' living quarters on the upper deck, tropicalized and with good ventilation Draft of the steamers max. 3 metres, of the lighters 1.5 and 3 metres. For my purposes, these draughts, which are 1 meter less, are extremely important when I am at any coastal point, e.g. Bagamoyo, where I have to reckon with 6 meters of ebb and flood difference, I would have to project a solid approach of the track to the shipping; because whether a stone dam at the head end is 6 + 5 -11 meters or only 6 + - 10 meters, in the cubic dimension of the possibly very long dam per running meter is a difference of 30 cubic meters, and would, even if one decided on a staggered approach (100 meters horizontally with 50 meters 1:50 alternating) would require investment costs that would not be in the right proportion to the value of the steamers. However, "gangways" could be produced cheaply enough if one is not tied to a specific location, as would be necessary for a railroad. Building wooden railroad piers, however, would be out of the question due to the length of the required timbers and the nature of the coral ground. I am also convinced that Mr. Holtz would consider 200-ton ships to be sufficient, and would concede a greater restriction of the coal rooms, if he did not start from the premise that the vehicles would have to steam to Bombay for "docking". The adventurous voyage of the small vehicles of the Schutztruppe is still too fresh in the memory, which were instradiated with 8 miles of power and a coal capacity for a maximum of 20 days on the Aden-Zanzibar voyage against the southwest monsoon, which had to force them to sail with ½, if not ¼, power in order not to take on too much water! But that is precisely why Mr. Holtz will also admit that a voyage to Bombay with the 300-ton ship he proposed was still a risk, if not for a dashing captain, then at least for the Rheder. Southwest of Socotra, where the nautical chart indicates "heavy and confused sea", and also just before Bombay, there is a sea that is dangerous for much larger ships, and the approach to the foggy Socotra is also very problematic for a small vessel due to the low visibility. In addition, a ship going to Bombay for "docking" would be very unprofitable. All this would probably be spared if we were content with 200 tons and a draught of 3 meters. It is well known that river water cleanses a ship of marine flora and fauna and, conversely, a river barge cleans itself in seawater. For this reason, for example, large ships like to visit the mouths of the Ganges, which is still deep enough for them above the brackish water. In our East African coastal rivers, however, a ship with a draught of 3 meters would still be safe to cross the bar and have enough water under its keel above the brackish water, but not one with a draught of 4 meters. This would therefore perhaps be appropriate and less time-consuming than docking in Bombay, and would also somewhat influence Mr. Holtz's shipbuilding proposals, which are otherwise certainly correct. I assume, however, that the ships should only enter the estuaries empty and only be built for seawater, which, as I recall, has a salt content of 0.cs. in the Baltic Sea, 3.5 in the North Sea, 4.3 in the Red Sea, 4.2 in the Indian Ocean, and generally 3.0 percent at the Aquator. This is noteworthy because the "Jühlke", which otherwise proved to be an excellent piece of work, could never be sufficiently ballasted at sea, presumably because it was designed for the dual purpose of river and sea navigation. Even if the operation with many but smaller ships is considerably more expensive due to the officer personnel, the frequency of the connection is precisely what makes regular management possible in all areas of colonization, and this is doubly necessary in the tropics, where the time of the European is very expensive. I have taken it upon myself to note a number of branches of business and trades for which there is a constant demand in Zanzibar from the coast and from passing ships, but which are operated by Indians etc. in such an imperfect, unpunctual, albeit cheap manner that they could be much better set up in Tanga and entirely in the European style. I am by no means thinking here that European craftsmen could compete with the natives as wage laborers, but that the German craftsman with a little capital and with colored journeymen can offer competition to all these Indians, simply because in most cases it does not matter whether an ordered work is carried out at all, but how it is carried out and whether the delivery date is kept. If it is not a matter of trifles, the native worker is not a man with whom you can do business, just as you would not hire someone who only spoke Polish, could not read or write in any language, and would be inclined to make this a constant excuse for unfulfilled promises. The situation is somewhat different, of course, with things that can be worked in stock, such as clothes and shoes, and with retail trade. The Indian is already satisfied with 20 rupees a month, and can therefore offer very persistent competition with regard to the latter, which he does systematically and in the lowest possible manner, whereby his social position as a selling native is of course of great benefit to him. A commissioner who claims 20 marks a day cannot, of course, rope for 3 days for a zebra skin; he does not do it either, but leaves such things to a dedicated Hindu. So far, apart from the Schutztruppe, there are only societies active in East Africa, although there are also missions. Our opponents are trying to portray the matter as if the state, i.e. everyone, should intervene for the pecuniary benefit of individuals. The reverse is, of course, the case. Individual capitalists have taken the great risk of increasing the German economic area for the benefit of all through their attempts at colonization. If, as happens everywhere in the tropics, these companies now seek to secure the best workers for themselves by paying the highest possible salaries, and if this does not immediately create a direct benefit for the German working proletariat, just as little as the costly experiments of industry, a field of immigration and work, then one can already, without too much responsibility for the small entrepreneurs who feel invited by this, talk about how an intelligent German who can put some capital into it could strive for an independent fortune in German East Africa. Merely to eke out an existence there, however, he will be a fool to venture into unfamiliar climates. But precisely because the climate does not suit everyone, and because, as our customs lists prove to the most stupid eye, there is something to be gained there, it is precisely for this reason that a skillful person, who snaps in there with what he can achieve, can only keep his head above water until he has acquired local knowledge - a situation that he can achieve neither here nor in the United States in the same time and with the same means. Almost none of those who go to America have a sufficiently practical idea of the fact that they will have to shed their skin three times before they can benefit from American life, that they will have to do without their national language, their law, their rationality for many years, namely until the shedding of their skin is complete. A relative advantage is gained by this emigration only by those who, standing here on the lowest social level, enter into the social parity still peculiar to the young country. For him, of course, all treatment is fair; he is more readily tolerated, gains a foothold, and finally advances; while he who comes over with means, wants to preserve character, offends everywhere with his manners, which are strange there, and finally easily loses all three. From these quite natural processes, which are repeated daily, a certain mutual prejudice against the characters of the people on both sides has arisen, which, of course, the uneducated immigrant as a "Lobourer" does not feel, and the American as a German hotel guest does not get to feel. Decent people are nevertheless the same here as there, only the customs are different. But it must be difficult to do business in any country with a misunderstood language and misunderstood manners, and it is truly a tremendous advantage for the man of the middle class if he is at home in these relationships on overseas soil from the outset. However, it would be seriously detrimental to the colonial cause if one were to ask the active small capitalist to try his luck in German East Africa on his own. On the contrary, one must honestly tell him that "alone" you will perish there. But I don't see why a communal approach, with contributions of labor and capital, i.e. small cooperatives, could not exist there?*) In the west of North America, too, the *) We cannot be friends with the idea of the formation of cooperatives of small capitalists for colonization in tropical countries, as it is developed here for East Africa, although in England, too, as can be seen from Professor Schaefer's article in No. 1 of this volume, the cooperative idea is making great progress in a more recent form. The English in New Zealand and Canada, however, have the advantage over us of living in a temperate, healthy climate under the protection of a healthy climate.

most beginner businesses only progress in "partvership". Usually one is the technician, the other the businessman. I don't want to claim that such businesses are not sometimes resolved in an unpleasant way, but in general they work in this form, colonized. - If several such cooperatives were to come together in one place, like Tanga, with deposits of 30-50,000 marks each, they could subject their mutual claims to arbitration. Each individual can pay interest on his deposit, have his actual work accounted for on a half-day basis, and would also be charged with the cost of his food. The underlying contract must at the same time be a cooperative and for each individual a service contract with stipulated wages for qualified performance. In America one could not have such a thing because there would be no mutual legal certainty, for there it is very soon said "minima non curat practor", but under the "German judge, who does not allow himself to be annoyed by creating justice even in small matters, this is very well conceivable. There are two things that point unquestionably to cooperative work in the initial culture in the tropics: firstly, the reduction in the cost of consumption, which, due to the abundance of natural resources and the rapid spoilage of food, makes cooking extremely cheap for many and very expensive for some, and secondly, the need for mutual assistance in the event of climatic illness. I do not wish to deny that the cooperative idea is psychologically unusual, that it touches on certain socialism of the old cultural world, which is frowned upon for good reason. But for those who can distinguish, it is quite another thing to be connected with money and skilled labor, to establish, as it were, only a personal union between two areas, each of which remains in its own right; or to divide everything, to provide the industrious and the industrious, the poor and the rich with the same ration. I even imagine that in such cooperatives some individuals would decline, many would merely hold on, and a few would become rich, according to energy, consistency and luck, as in ordinary life. That Tanga would be a place for 10 or 20 such cooperatives, which would have to be supported in their business by a cooperative bank, and would prosper all the faster, becoming the improved Zanzibar, can only be denied by those who would be able to refute what I have said in the articles "Building" and "Railway Construction". Only, when I speak of German craftsmen, one must not think of local day labor, but of skilled workers who can train and permanently employ a large number of coolies, I reckon at least 20 for each cooperative. It is also necessary for each such cooperative to provide itself with adequate land, i.e. a block of the laid-out city for residential buildings and workshops, and a suburban area for the utilization of the workers, should a time arise when there is a lack of orders. The entire western American farm culture, for example, is gradually being built on this principle. Originally, the farm is usually just a piggy bank for the otherwise unusable labor of the Hamesteadler. So here we are only talking about small occasional plantations. - A completely different task is that of large-scale plantation cultivation. Here it is important to work towards prime qualities with scientific calculation. Here only big business can act with certainty and, as in Holland, it will only be possible to achieve something through civil servants, the best capacities of the various branches of government in English-speaking areas to be able to cultivate the soil without having to make great experiments with regard to the cultural capacity of the land. In East Africa, however, the situation is substantially different, since the competition of the Indians is overwhelming, the climate is dangerous for people who cannot afford to stay in temperate climates every few years because of their small capital, the conditions for refusal are little known and there are generally no preconditions that are absolutely necessary for the establishment of Europeans in these countries. Such a cooperative, even if it should find a leader who combines the most brilliant qualities, can only be successful in East Africa after the experiences that have been made with colonization in South America, for example, if it can lean on a significant capital that clears away the manifold difficulties of the first stage of development and has a fertilizing effect. But then the purpose of the cooperative becomes almost illusory. We can only warn against making premature advances in this direction until the living conditions in East Africa have been comprehensively clarified. With the resumption of colonization activities and the establishment of the steamship connection, it will soon become clear where work can be started with Prosit, and then it may be advisable to take a closer look at the idea on the basis of the experience gained by the English. With this limitation in mind, we consider the suggestions made here to be valuable and worthy of consideration. The only principle that promises success here is to seek out the best land and offer the highest salaries, for if our colonial products do not excel on the market, even towns in such good natural locations as Tangas will not expand and thus will not bring their first colonists any great wealth. I would also like to mention here a very fortunate idea that I came across in the introduction to the "Colonial Yearbook of 1889", namely the proposal to undertake a planned settlement of freed slaves by the mission in the hinterland of Dar=es=Salaam. As I recommend Tanga as a suburb of the white colony, it is particularly clear to me that the magnificent terrain of Dar=es=Salaam, which is predestined to be a port of war, could also be conquered for German culture, and, since the Europeans there are badly afflicted by malaria, preferably by their pupils of Ethiopian race, who can tolerate the climate very well. If what I have said about cooperative urban colonization by Europeans is to be regarded as impracticable from the outset because there is a lack of processes in the homeland, I must reply that here in the homeland the conditions do not invite comparison. If everything that is impossible in Europe were to be found impossible in the tropics, then our entire tropical colonization would be impossible. The rights of the Sultan of Witu. At the Beledsoni Canal, the conflict of interests between the Sultan of Witu and the British East African Company has led to an unfortunate riot by the latter, which, according to English sources, has occupied the area in question and the Sultan's customs house with a force. The Sultan of Witu has withdrawn from the area and, now that it is almost too late, the matter will probably be dealt with diplomatically. We have already emphasized several times that the Sultan's claims are of a private and political nature, and that it is necessary to maintain them at all costs, as otherwise the entire Tana region would be lost to us. The aspirations of the English, as shown on the Ravenstein map we have already characterized, are of a purely arbitrary nature; the most that can be conceded to them is the area between Tana, the Beledsoni Canal and the East. The question of the ownership of Manda and Patta is also still awaiting a solution, which is all the more urgent as the English are also creating faits accomplis there and want to trample on the historical right of the Sultan of Witu in a similar way to that of the Portuguese in South Africa. We have already pointed out this omission several times and now provide the following indisputable statistical material for the assessment of the question, which supplements the earlier reports by Dr. Kersten and Dr. Fischer in some essential points. Gender table of the Nebahanites. About 6-700 years ago the first Nebahanites came to Patta, they were three brothers: Mohsmed ben Osman, Suliman the Osman, Ali ben Osman. When they arrived there, a native Sulkan ruled. The last one= Mohsmed ben Shahäli mäti; he had only one daughter, born Sultan. Mohamed the Osman married this daughter of the native Sultan and thus came to rule. 1. reg. reb. Mohamed the Ottoman is therefore the first Nebahanite to rule Patta. After him came his son 2 reigning Neb. Achmed the Mohammed the Ottoman came to rule. After him, his son 3 reigned Reb.

Achmed, after his death 5th reign Neb. Mohammed. Both had sons; Achmed's son was called Mohamed, Mohamed's son Achmed. The latter, however, 6 reg. neb. Achmed the Mohamed came to rule first, for what reason is unknown; after him came 7. reg. Reb. Mohammed the Achmed came to rule. From now on we have two lines from which sultans come to power alternately:

After that, the son of Bana Schöch ben Fumo Mahdi Fémo Bakäri came to power in the 19th reign and ruled for 13 years. He went to Zanzibar to recognize Seid Seid's supremacy and was therefore deposed by his relatives. At the instigation of the people of Patta, Siu and Amu, Seid Seid had him tied up and imprisoned for 2 years. After 2 years he returned to Lamn, married there and kept company with the Arabs. After Fumo Bakari, Achmed the Shoakh the 20th reg. reb. Fémo Lud came to power; he ruled for 13 years. The Arabs, with whom Fumo Bakari had made friends, came to Patta and defeated him, whereupon he went to Osi. He ruled here for 8 years. The Arabs take Patta.

Correspondence. The future of Swaziland. Londen, April 8, 1890: The fate of important parts of South Africa is rapidly approaching its solution. Since our last account of Amatonga and Swazi Land and the Transvaal Free State (see the No. of December 21) appeared, new news has arrived of the progress of negotiations between England and the plenipotentiaries of the Government at Pretoria Swazi Land, which is at present in question, comprises about 8000 English square miles and is considered rich in ores, as well as valuable for agriculture. The native population is reckoned to be no more than 60,000, having been greatly reduced by earlier wars with their fard neighbors. Among them live about 1000 white settlers, mostly people from the South African Republic or the Orange Free State, with an admixture of Englishmen. Between Swafl=land and the sea, to which the citizens of the South African Republic naturally aspire, lies Amatonga= or Tonga=land. But the territory of two small chiefdoms between Swazi= and Tonga=Land extends as far as the Maputa=River, where access to the sea could at least be achieved. Should England now encroach there and act as a barrier against Transvaal! Or should the South African Republic, whether through territorial annexation or through the establishment of a sovereignty, establish itself there. The latter, according to everything we have learned, is decidedly the wish of the white population, mostly of Dutch blood, which has in fact governed Swafi=land for the past two years through a committee appointed under the recently deceased King Umbandine. According to the latest news, Umbandine's son, who is still a child and under the guardianship of his mother, has now been proclaimed prince. In reality, however, a three-man government consisting of a Boer, an Englishman and a Swabian is in charge. In the meantime, the white population is pushing for annexation to the South African Republic, while the Swazis, through their representative, emphasize the preservation of their independence as a people. In view of the difficulty that England is experiencing in invading the latter with armed force for the reasons mentioned earlier, namely the lack of a good connection between Zulu and Swazi land, the local Great African party is for the time being acting as if it respects the wishes of the Swazis. It claims that they are a highly warlike people, with whom one must at least reckon, although they only number 00,000 people. However, the Swaft cannot be compared with the Zulu. At least the Scottish traveler to Africa, David Lesliel, described to us years ago in personal conversation the contempt that the Zulu had for the Swaft, or at least thought it good to show before the battle. "Are the Swast (Umovari) more than a people?" - exclaimed the Zulu chief Umniamanä on one such occasion - "and are we not three regiments? Who among us is afraid to face a whole people with a single band of Zulu? How many men does it take to drive a herd of cattle! The Swaft are dogs who should be forced to eat the refuse of Zulu food!" That was the language the Zulu used about the Swafl. "Dogs" was the Zulu standing expression for the latter. The warlike tribe of the "Celestials" (that is the meaning of the Zulu name), however, always liked to make a splendid show of high-flying eloquence; and in any case, the description of the battles between them and the Swazis shows that they also knew how to wield the spear well. In the long run, however, the Swazi people, no matter how brave they were, could not possibly defend themselves against the simultaneous encroachment from the Dutch and English sides. Also, the assertion that one is dealing with a tribe that is not to be underestimated in terms of warfare is probably only intended to deter the Boers for the time being until the English themselves are in a position to take possession of Swazi land. Natal, where the majority of the white population consists of Englishmen, is in favor of eventual possession. In the far more important Cape Settlement, however, where the majority of the population is of Dutch origin and language, there is a tendency towards concessions to the South African Republic. This circumstance alone requires the London government to exercise a certain amount of caution. The white population in Swaziland declares a change in the form of government to be absolutely necessary, demands annexation to the Transvaal and wants the Dutch and English languages to be recognized as equal in the courts of law. The leading politicians in Natal, on the other hand, who demand the confiscation of all harbors and possible landing places on the east coast up to Delagoa Bay in order to seal off Transvaal completely from the sea, would like to make the Swafi area an English settlement at the same time as Tonaa Land. One proposal is to leave the Swafi in their full or half independence and to establish a special administration for the white settlers. Yet another proposal amounts to a division of Swazi land between England and the South African Republic, with the western part going to the latter and the eastern part to England - which would be tantamount to blocking access to the sea for the Dutch commonwealth. Some think with Lady Frederik Cavendisch, or those who stand behind ibr, that one need not be too opposed to a concession to the South African Republic, since the enormous increase in English immigration there *) S. David Leslie's "Among the Zulus and Amatongas 1873".
English immigration will soon put an end to that Free State anyway, so that Transvaal and Swaziland will one day be won with one and the same blow. The new electoral law in the South African Republic stipulates a five-year residence period for obtaining citizenship. But five years is a short time. For a number of gold miners, this period will soon have expired. This makes it all the more urgent to supply the Low German people of the Transvaal, who are maintaining their independent free state, with a related bloodline as quickly and as extensively as possible. In the current negotiations, the representative of the Swaft emphasizes the need to restrict the trade in alcoholic beverages. King Umbandine died as an irrepressible drunkard of firewater. Among his people in general, Europeans in those regions have been promoting drunkenness in the most unscrupulous way for a long time. Now that the Swazi chiefs are trying to protect themselves against it, these savages truly show themselves to be the better people. Even Leslie, who, according to his own account, unfortunately did not refrain from participating in such imports - even if only as a gift for the king - described the devastation that rum and other equally strong drinks had caused among the Tonga in his work cited above. From Delagoa Bay, he arrived at Unozingili's main kraal, which lay in the middle of a dense grove of living and rotting plants with a strong and foul smell. The name of the place, which consisted of about a hundred huts, was: Nein amach=bo'nzwe; meaning the place "where all the lying and false accusations circulating in the country will be put to rest" - in other words, a kind of hostel of justice. During the night, Leslie was awakened by terrible shouting and horrible noise. An old man was brought into the hut where Leslie was staying, shouting like a madman and foaming at the mouth. It turned out that the unmixed rum had been drunk en masse by the Swazi. For England's own sake, which already exercises dominion far beyond its armed forces in all parts of the world, and for the sake of peace in South Africa, where the population of Dutch and Anglo-Saxon blood is already tense towards each other, it must be hoped that the future of the Transvaal State will not be violently obstructed. In our opinion, however, the closest possible union between the South African Republic and the Orange Free State is now urgently recommended. Only in this way will both be able to save their existence. England versus Portugal. Brussels, January 10, 1890: "When one sits in a glass house, one should not throw stones." Mr. V. C. F. Moodie should have heeded this proverb when he addressed his letter to The Times, dated Cape Town, December 18, 1889, and printed yesterday. "Num and arrack," he says of the Amatonga, "the poor people drink like their mother's milk. Even children of six drink a glass of it without flinching. These are the splendid habits that these poor but intelligent people have learned from the Portuguese, who are well-lived and druthers. They sell rum as an advantageous commodity and do not do business without selling a certain quantity of it. The Amatonga are happy to die if they only enter Nirvana in a state of intoxication. Among the Amatonga, one looks in vain for moral courage in the men and virtue in the women. "Portuguese rule," continues Moodie. "is a curse for the regents of East Africa, and a shame and disgrace for the Weitzen. Among all the tribes inhabiting Portuguese territory, robbery, murder, anarchy and debauchery are normal conditions of life. The Portuguese have not the slightest power over the natives; they eke out their miserable existence only by cowardly inciting the individual tribes against each other and thus weakening them. The Portuguese are only tolerated by the Amatonga and other tribes because they are the only trading centers where the Reger can sell their products and buy necessities. Even if the mismanagement of Portugal's non-European possessions cannot be denied, and the picture painted by Moodie can indeed only be described as distorted in some respects, the English are certainly not called upon to hold up a mirror to the Portuguese. The description of the Amatonga in the first passage of Moodie's letter fits exactly to the Anstral negroes, who have always enjoyed British rule. Every point is true; but in their demoralization the English are as innocent as lambs! It is not only English traders, but even English missionaries, who hand the South Sea islanders a cup of rum to promote the work of conversion, and awaken in them a craving for firewater. On the Solomon Islands, a Baptist missionary tries to lure the souls to be saved away from his Wesleyan colleague, who offers the baptized only two glasses of rum, by giving them four glasses and winning them over for himself Jn Australia, the aborigines have almost succumbed to the lead, the poison and the firewater and other evils of the British settlers. Only in the deep north, the north and the west do stronger tribes still live, but everywhere the Austral Negroes have to give way to the invasion of the Europeans. If they do not willingly move to the sparse hunting grounds of the sun-scorched interior, the humane Briton is not content to wait for the gradual extinction of the poor creatures caused by demoralization and infestation, but simply murders them wherever he finds them. I am not talking here about events in the early days of colonization, but about everyday events in modern times. An Australian weekly magazine, the "Queenslander",

Page 26

last year published a series of articles penned by the former police inspector Moncrieff, in which the most hair-raising descriptions were given of the atrocities committed by the "black police" in the far west and north. The latter are recruited from Australian Negroes who are trained and equipped with sabres, revolvers and Winchester revetir rifles and are commanded by European officers in detachments. If an indigenous tribe that touches the most advanced European settlements on its hunting expeditions, and which completely lacks the concept of property rights, has speared a cow or a sheep as welcome prey, or if an Australian Negro has slain the white violator of his home honor, the detachment of black police is brought in from the next station. The naturally bloodthirsty and savage black mercenaries of a government that always brags about its alleged humanity tremble with joy when it goes out to destroy defenceless compatriots armed only with spears and arrows. These beasts of men revel in the bloodbath they cause, and the atrocities they commit cannot be recounted. The not too soft-hearted cattle breeders, who are always trying to open up new grazing grounds, often find it too inconvenient to call in the black police to get rid of the troublesome neighbors of wandering tribes; they use a simple means to do so. These people have plenty of strychnine to poison the wild dogs that worry their herds and bake a number of loaves of bread, so-called steamers, to which they add a good dose of this white powder. The bread thus pulverized is placed in front of the huts, just as chunks are thrown in front of the predatory game, so that the hungry Negroes, who are loitering around, consume them and breathe their last in unspeakable pain." Does a nation that acts in this way have a right to hurl the accusation of inhumanity at another! K. F. Communications from the Society. The Committee held a meeting in the Society's offices on 19 December under the chairmanship of Privy Councillor Simon, at which the report of the Commission for Practical Colonization was received on the Perrot motion concerning the establishment of an East African Steamship Company and on the motion of the Brussels Division concerning agitation for the purpose of colonization in South-West Africa. The committee approved the statutes of the Frankfurt a. O., Speyer and Steitin departments. A committee meeting was held on January 7, which we will report on in connection with the next one, as the treatment of the applications has not yet been completed. Dr. Hammacher, our first Vice President, who was ill with pneumonia, is fortunately on the mend. Prof. Dr. Erwin Nasse, the first chairman of the Bonn department, died on 4 January. In his passing we have lost a convinced and zealous promoter of our colonial activities. The Berlin department, chaired by Mr. Pros. v. Cuny, held a gentlemen's evening on the 10th to discuss the subsidized steamship line to East Africa. The secretary of the Dresden Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Schulze, examined the question from the point of view of trade and enumerated the damage and disadvantages from which trade to that destination was currently suffering. In particular, transhipment in England had become completely impossible for some products due to the merchandiso marks act. Even if Germany's trade turnover with East Africa was not yet so great that, if it did not increase, it would justify the introduction of a subsidy, the example of the Congo State of Transvaal, Far Africa, etc., showed that the development of all these countries had made great progress. There was therefore no doubt that East Africa would also become an important market for our products. Mr. Redner pleaded for the construction of the line to Madagascar and the call at Lourenco Marquez in order to gain contact with Trausvaal, which could perhaps become a German emigration area, as the Boers would have to defend themselves against being flooded by the English. The speaker also discussed the possibility of calling at Alexandria, opposed the Aden=Sansidar branch line and at the end of his speech pointed out the connection between German colonial and economic policy. Dr. O. Kersten took a look at the development of trade and transport, in which the explorers and missionaries played a large part, and at the colonial powers' thirst for ice. The establishment of the line was also a major political issue and any hesitation could now be disastrous. As far as the treatment of colonial matters by the parties in Germany was concerned, Redner advised reconciliation, a pooling of our forces, especially as by far the most important part of overseas policy, which dealt with the beneficial utilization of our surplus population, had not yet been seriously tackled. A great gain from the establishment of the East African steamship line would be the strengthening of confidence in the steadfastness of our government's colonial policy, which was very important for the acquisition of capital. He also favored the extension to Delagoabai and Natal, the establishment of a coastal shipping line for East Africa, and the setting of the lowest possible passage prices for 2nd and 3rd class. He hoped that the new line would pacify the Arabs, and that activity would resume. We must leave the responsibility for the latter assertions to the sender. D. R.
of the plantation companies, the development of shipping on the Tana and Jub and the construction of a navigable road to Aepuapua. Even more important was a secondary railroad from Kiloa to the north bank of the Nyassa, which would also paralyze the slave trade. In the debate, Mr. Stranß cited some striking examples of the poor connection with East Africa, and Paul Reichard once again pointed out the Pelitic importance of the line with regard to the position towards the English and the Sultan of Zanzibar. The following resolution was then adopted unanimously: The Assembly expresses its warmest thanks to the Imperial Government for the enactment of a bill concerning a mail steamer connection with East Africa subsidized by the Empire. It recognizes the plan as appropriate and regards the early establishment of this connection as a matter of life and death for German trade relations with East Africa and for our colonial ventures there. The Assembly fully endorses the petition of the Board of the German Colonial Society in this regard and expresses the hope that the Reichstag will strongly support the efforts of the Imperial Government to promote our relations with East Africa. Small communications. - (The reinforcement of the German Schutztruppe) under the leadership of Lieutenant Märcker arrived in Tenerissa on December 30, as we are informed by letter, and intends to arrive in Sandwichhafen in the first days of the second half of January. The Schutztruppe received daily lessons in the Herero language and Dutch en route. (According to a telegram from Wolff in Brussels, the Belgian Anti-Slavery Society intends to equip an expedition to Lake Tanganyika. The news is still awaiting confirmation. (From East Africa.) There has been a significant improvement in Emin Pasha's health. - On January 5, Wißmann captured the fortified position of Bani Heri near Saadani. The enemy, who put up stubborn resistance, suffered heavy losses. - News has recently arrived from Southwest Africa, including information about the journey of the well-known adventurer Lewis to England. It is reported in several newspapers: "Lewis had sent the necessary machines to Walsischbai in 1888 to exploit his mines in Damaraland, the ownership of which had been awarded to him by the mixed German-English commission. On the way from the coast to Otjimbinque, however, they were stopped at Tsaubis, where the deputy Reichskommissar Neis and the Schutztruppe under Captain v. François had settled, and the owner was told that he could only begin his mining work once he had submitted to the existing legislation. He would therefore have to recognize the mining authority set up by the empire, register with it and provide a certificate. As long as this was not done, his machines would be detained. Lewis was not satisfied with this; the previous year he had told the Reichskommissar to his face that he did not recognize the German protectorate, including the Imperial official, as an authority there. Accordingly, he also wanted to put himself out of the way by way of the Verg authority. But when he saw that his protests were not respected and that they were serious about complying with the law, he immediately turned back in Walsischdai and complained in Cape Town. R. Lewis was not expelled from the German shooting area. As his complaints were not heard by the Cape government, he went to England to seek help from the national government. He will undoubtedly receive the same answer there as in Cape Town, namely that one cannot interfere in German affairs, and this would remove the basis for the resistance that arose in Damaraland against German patronage. (The "Colonial Thaler" of Italy and the Maria Theresa Thaler.) The "Risorma", Crispi's newspaper, recently published a series of articles, "La moneta coloniale", on the minting of a new silver coin for Massanab and the Italian protectorate in Africa, as well as Abyssinia, which is linked to it by treaties. The new colonial thaler is mainly intended to displace the Maria Theresa thaler from that part of Africa which Italy considers dependent on its interests. The Italian government would thus find a good use for a silver treasure that has been lying unused for almost 20 years as a result of the Latin coinage convention and, by introducing an Italian coin and circulating it in the aforementioned territories, would secure an intimate connection with them and strengthen trade relations. It is advocated that the thaler should be minted in a similar way to the Maria Theresa thaler, as the natives are suspicious of any new coin. It is possible that such a new coin will be introduced in Africa if the need really exists, and if the Regus gives the Italian colonial thaler a legal course in Athiopia, if it can find a use as tax money and in Massanah. If the development of East Africa makes greater progress, the German side will also have to deal with the currency question there, to which we already referred in No. 30 of the previous year's "Unser kleines Geld in Deutsch=Ostafrika" - (The slavery question in the Senegal region) was the subject of a lengthy discussion at the Congrès Colonial in Paris. Captain Binger, who recently returned to France from a very interesting journey in the Niger region, during which he also visited Kong, expressed the opinion that nothing could

Page 27

value of the land more than the labor of freed slaves supervised by European bosses. It was pointed out that the Vatres du Salnt=Esprit had established a plantation in Kito where they employed freed slaves and that there was a plantation school in Thiels which was ready to take on freed slaves as lobnard riders, but that it was not possible to free the captives en masse because the population would emigrate to the Sudan. As a result of the expeditions to the upper Niger, the villages would have been populated with freed slaves, thus gradually creating a solid base of farmers in this country. Admiral Ballon, who was governor of Senegal in 1882, criticized the French government's treatment of the freed slaves, as the administration gives every slave who escapes from the neighbouring territories a freedom document without taking any further care of him. The consequence of this is that the slave hires himself out in the summer as a henchman or a lait carrier, but becomes unemployed in the winter, half-starves or robs and plunders. Did not the former prisoner owe his labor to society for the freedom he had acquired? This was a difficult question of morality and even of politics, because slavery was one of the main living conditions of the natives. Speaker then showed that slavery in Senegal was a mild one, that everything was produced by the labor of the slaves and that with the suppression of slavery whole fertile provinces would lie desolate. By freeing the escaped slaves, many of the Peulhs who had been devoted to them had been driven into the arms of the Moors, who were hostile to French culture, and today there was a desert where numerous villages had flourished. He then proposed various amendments to the system, the main idea of which was that the slave must earn his freedom through labor in a contractual relationship. The Assembly adopted a resolution to this effect (Stauley's) behavior towards Emin Pasha has been the subject of much criticism in England. The "Admiralty and borso gnards Garetto" of January 4 of this year makes the following remarks: "Lieutenant General Sir Gerald Grabam, in his letter to the "Times" of January 28, has written the following for the deceased hero of Khartoum against Stanley's "mean Angrisfe" published in his letter to Sir Francis de Winton. With perfect truthfulness General Graham states that Mr. Stanley's ideal conception of duty is one peculiar to himself. Those who really know the mighty American windbag are not taken in by his sham arguments. Not content with throwing mud at General Gordon, he must go so far as to accuse one of his own officers, Major Barttelot, of disobeying orders. It is a curious commentary on the exploits of Stanley's expedition that no one other than Mr. Heury Stanley is permitted to blow his own trumpet or prevent his own complaints. Cdinesians for Kaiser=Wilhelmsland. The question of the settlement of Chinese in Kaiser Wilhelmsland, about which we published an article by Dr. Hindorf in the previous issue, has also been discussed in detail by E. Meyger, the well-known expert on the Dutch East Indies, in the journal "Aus allen Weltteilen". He writes: "The main part of the immigration in Singavore (known to be the center of the labor traffic for the Hind Indies and the Jntels) was provided by the Chinese; in 1887, 167,906 people arrived there (including 6,271 women), in 1886, however, only 146,862 (including 4,714 women). Despite many complaints against them - the New Guinea Society, too, has reportedly spoken out against the use of Chinese workers - the demand is nevertheless increasing, and this will be even more the case when the cultivation of the extensive lands in northern Vorneo, which were taken over by planters last year, is tackled. The premium of the cultivators, which formerly amounted to about 60 8 per head, has already risen to 110-115 8. I will not go into the pros and cons of using Chinese laborers here, and reserve the right to do so in more detail elsewhere. It seems to be a fact, however, that if one wants to cultivate plantations on an extensive scale in the Hind Indies or on the islands, wherever they are, one will not be able to do without Chinese labor (with the exception of Java). Not only the fact that only the Chinese emigrate in relatively large numbers and that the number of these emigrants will continue to increase in the future, but also their greater productivity indicate this. According to the repeatedly mentioned reports of the Dutch Confulate in Singapore 11887), even Malavanese workers (with the exception of Singapore itself) were paid 7-10 Doll. Doll. per month, whereby usually 16 to 24 Doll. At such prices, the competition against planters on Java, especially if they find more support from the government than was previously the case, is almost unbearable. The question can therefore no longer arise as to whether one wants to make use of the Chinese, but how this should be done in order to prevent the disadvantages associated with their appearance can be put on the agenda, but this does not concern us further here. And at the end of the article: "As we have seen, it is a plentiful labor force that is needed (in addition to capital), and in order to obtain it to the extent necessary, one will, despite all opposition, have to resort to Chinese, who, by the way, are better than their reputation, especially in a country without a significant population and culture. Initially, the company would have to take the recruitment of workers into its own hands, and since all beginnings are difficult, it would take quite a long time before a significant number of workers were available, although Deli has given an encouraging example in this respect. Therefore, the actual Chinese immigration would have to be promoted from the very beginning, and in particular no stone should be left unturned to attract Chinese entrepreneurs.
Chinese entrepreneurs, who would be in the best position to bring their own landed gentry there. In my opinion, Kaiser Wilhelmsland will only have a great future if it succeeds in establishing a flourishing Chinese colony there under German management and with the support of the German Empire, not just a labor colony with a constantly changing workforce, but a real settlement colony. If China does not get ahead of us and attack us in our own territory, the economic struggle of the future will be directed towards East Asia, and Dr. Jannasch has shown what advantage Australia can offer the English in this respect (Kolonien. Kolonialpolitik und Auswanderung 1885 p. 3611, according to which it would certainly be of great value for Germany to create a similar base, which would be even more valuable in certain respects. If it is really possible - and there can be little doubt about the possibility - to win a stationary Chinese population for Kailer Wilhelmsland, a population that is not only hard-working and industrious, but also studious and willing, it will be possible to make some industries indigenous there that might otherwise be doomed in Europe - after all, some industrialists will be forced to relocate their industries to foreign countries in the not too distant future, be it because of the lack of work or the cost of marriage. In addition, however, and this could not be emphasized enough, a very lively trade would develop between the two countries (China and Kaiser Wilhelmland), which could only be beneficial to German influence. - I shall not confine myself to what I have said; it is not my intention to attempt to write more or less vantage-pictures of the future, but only to point out a means - perhaps the only possible one - by which Kaiser Wilhelmsland could become a second Java. If Emin Pasha and Friedrich Ratzel thought they could make the suggestion of settling Chinese in Africa, then it can be even less conspicuous if I consider a colonization of New Guinea, which is much closer to them in every respect, by sons of the Middle Kingdom under German leadership to be possible. Literature. Prasilian economic images. Experiences and research by Karl Kaerger, Dr. jur. 530 pp. Berlin 1889, printed and published by Gergonne & Co, Wilheimstrasse 20. This book, whose author is not unknown to our readers, has a great advantage over all other works on Brazil published up to now in that it describes the life and hardships of a jungle colonist from the beginning of settlement. Most colonists have neither the time nor the necessary education to describe colonization from the beginning in all its manifold relations; the author, however, who has always treated economic questions with scientific thoroughness, has also transferred his way of detailed treatment of national economic questions to the description of jungle colonization and with particular success. He had settled in the area of the upper Jtapoci in Santa Catharina, in a region that was still devoid of pasture and as remote as possible from the other colonies, so that he could fully savor the joys and sufferings of a jungle colonist. Prepared by thorough studies, he gained in a surprisingly short time an overview of the economic methods of the settlers, the activities of the Hamburg Colonization Association of 1849, which he criticized in many ways, and was also in a position to give advice on how to remove the obstacles that had hindered the colony's recent prosperity. How important it is to have a thoroughly accurate description of this colony will be appreciated by anyone who has read the almost ludicrous advertisements for the founding of Epe in a newspaper such as the Kreuzzeitung. Another part deals with the colonies of Sko Bento, Blumenau, Brusque, the province of Parané and especially with the province of Sdo Paulo, which the author got to know by traveling for several months. He proves in his book that the aversion to the province, which caused such enormous damage to the German-Brazilian colonization efforts, should no longer exist today, that under the completely changed conditions of the present time, a German colonization of the rich province should be accompanied by success. He is a supporter of colonization on a grand scale, which works according to a certain plan with considerable financial means, and for which he has already taken up the cudgels in these journals. One can only wish that such a force as that of the author could be made useful for our German colonies. We have few men of high scientific standing who have colonized with the urt in their hands, so that, if at all we are to proceed to significant practical activity in the German colonies, we will not be able to make a large selection. And instead of sending inexperienced people to the colonies over and over again, it would surely be more rational to use people who are familiar with trovic conditions. Jeppo, Fred. Map of the Transvaal or S. A. Republic and surrounding territories 1 : 1 000 000. Pretoria 1889. This map, which extends from latitude 20 - 31 degrees south and longitude 22 - 33 degrees east, covers a large part of South East Africa in addition to the Transvaal, the whole of the Orange Free State, all of Nakal, Sululand and Swaziland, East and West Griqualand, some parts of the Cape Colony, British Bethschuanaland and a large part of Matabeleland. Jeppe, a German who has been engaged in the cartography of Trandoaal for twenty years, has based his map on the latest surveys carried out by the government of this country. A comparison with the first edition published about ten years ago reveals considerable changes in the boundaries of the individual countries and in the location of the towns. (In the case of Pretoria, for example, the deviation is half a degree.

Two volumes with about 400 illustrations and plans in 50 to 60 deliveries of 30 kr each. Vienna Volkswirtschaftlicher Verlag Alexander Dorn. This work presents the reader with an interesting picture of today's world traffic by sea. All those ports which occupy a prominent position in international traffic are characterized here in terms of history, location, population, facilities and development, and their commercial importance and characteristics are also taken into account in an outstanding manner. The excellence of the text is vouched for by the most famous names of the authors, namely Mr. v. Lehnert through his widely distributed travel work "Around the World" and Mr. Pros. Zehden for his numerous and exemplary publications on commercial geography. The design of the work is thoroughly dignified; the publisher has spared no expense in supporting the reader's imagination with artistically executed illustrations (original woodcuts). The masterfully reproduced harbor plans are drawn under the direct supervision of the ship-of-the-line captain Josef Ritter v. Lehnert in the most careful professional manner and with consideration of the latest changes by proven experts, so that the current state of the harbors, as well as the associated buildings and nautical facilities, is always shown. Finally, as an introduction to the first volume, there is a clear, likewise illustrated description of the history and current state of maritime traffic and its means. Entrances for the library. Given the limited space available to us for book reviews, it will not be possible to discuss all works in detail, but we never fail to recommend new colonial writings, which are assigned to our library by the authors and publishers, to colonial friends in word and deed, for which the administration of the library is given ample opportunity by our members. We hereby once again express our sincere thanks for the books donated to our library. Receipts in December. Sasuess, I. O. Jn Dertsc-Ouafnika during the Aufslandel. Reiieg der De.

The Anglo-Portuguese dispute. The Anglo-Portuguese dispute over the action of Major Serva Pinto in the Makolololand seemed to be already at an end, as the Portuguese Government had promised to withdraw its troops from the territory claimed by England, subject to the decision of the dispute by a court of arbitration, and the latter was apparently satisfied with this answer. One could therefore believe that a basis for a calm understanding had been found. On 12. On January 12, however, Lord Salisbury issued an ultimatum to the Lisbon government, in which the English government declared itself not satisfied with the assurances of the Portuguese government and, based on the communications of its consul in Mozambique that the Serpa Pinto expedition had already occupied and fortified the Schire, Katungas and other places and territories of the Makololo, made the categorical demand that the following telegraphic instructions should be sent immediately to the governor of Mozambique: "Withdraw all Portuguese forces which are actually at the Shire and in the Makololo territories and in Mashonaland." Otherwise, Lord Salisbury's ultimatum considered the assurances given by the Portuguese government to be illusory and threatened to break off diplomatic relations. The threat, which was emphasized by the rapid assembly of warships in the vicinity of a large number of Portuguese possessions, had such an intimidating effect on the Portuguese government that, according to its reply, it "will send to the Governor of Mozambique the orders enforced by Great Britain", "reserving in all respects the rights of the Portuguese Crown to the African territories mentioned, as well as the right conferred on it by Article XII of the Berlin Convention to bring the dispute to a final solution by mediation or arbitration" But the reply remained a humiliation even with this reservation and when its wording became known in Lisbon, the unwillingness of the people forced the Cabinet to abdicate. The further development of this dispute must be awaited with eager anticipation. If Portugal has now given way to force, it has not forfeited the right to pursue the dispute along the lines laid down in Art. XII of the Congo Act. This Article XII reads: "If serious differences of opinion arise between the Powers which sign the present Act, or those which may subsequently accede to it, with reference to the boundaries or within the boundaries of the territories mentioned in Article 1 and subject to the system of free trade, those Powers undertake, before resorting to force of arms, to have recourse to the mediation of one or more of the friendly Powers. In the same case, the same Powers reserve the right to resort to arbitration at their discretion." - The territory now in dispute between England and Portugal falls in any case, so far as it belongs to the Shire river basin, within the free trade zone, and it would therefore be a flagrant violation of the Congo Act if England were to refuse a request from Portugal for mediation or arbitration. We therefore cannot yet believe that England has already taken such a step. She claims to be absolutely convinced of her rights, and when the Chancellor of the Treasury, Goschen, speaks of the encroachments of Portuguese agents on a territory in which they have not a shadow of right, the whole Jingo party believes him and rejoices. But the opposite is probably true. The English have by no means undoubted rights to the Shire and Mashonaland. They have skillfully ignored everything that the Portuguese have ever reported or done in these countries. It is a fact that can no longer be denied that Livingstone did not "discover" Lake Ryassa, but only revisited it with Portuguese help, and hopefully, since the Batalha Reis investigations, this title of fame of the man whom the English have stamped as their best political agent will now disappear forever. Perhaps they are still forming the theory that all African countries visited by Livingstone must become English, if they have now begun to declare the mission stations established at his instigation as inviolable national treasures. But as far as the investigations of Batalha Reis mentioned in earlier issues are concerned, he recently proved in a letter to the "Times" that Portugal's claim was not only based on historically well-founded and documented rights, but that these rights had actually been exercised and not only nominally. In the above-mentioned letter, the author of the same, referring to a study published by him last year in the Scottiah Geographical Magazine*), remarks the following to clarify the issue: 1) That the Portuguese already in the 17th century not only had the *) The work was also published in Portuguese and English in the form of a brochure: Es portuguezas na Regido do Nyassa por Jayme Batalba Reis. Lisboa, Imprensa Nacional 1889. We draw the attention of our readers to this in particular, because it would indeed be an unparalleled injustice if the merits of the Portuguese were to be persistently hushed up by a clique of English geographers, who are unfortunately also followed by some Germans. Livingstone has achieved so much praiseworthy work, here following in the footsteps of the Portuguese, there going it alone, that a correction of his merits will not detract from his fame. Of recent Portuguese publications that aim to shed more light on Portugal's efforts both in terms of geographical research and the suppression of the slave trade in the face of English suspicions and concealments, the following should be mentioned in particular: L'ineidont Anglo-Portugais.

They did not only navigate Lake Nyassa, but also the Shire River and provided very detailed descriptions of both, also drew a map of both, and that they defeated several of the tribal chiefs who ruled over the landscapes between Zambezi and Lake Noassa at that time. 2. that the Vortugu giants knew the Sbire and the Nrassa and correctly recognized their importance when they described them as a good road into the interior of Africa, along which Athiopia could also be easily reached to the north. 3. that the Portuguese traveled both the river and the lake in the last century, long before Livingstone, without reaching them, gave descriptions of the adjoining regions, which he mostly borrowed from the older descriptions of the Vanguard giants, and that it was they who communicated to the learned societies what was remarkable from a geographical point of view. (Batalha explains on this occasion that he is able to give the names of some well-known travelers who, in the first periods of the 19th century, i.e. in 1824, 1846 and 1853, i.e. before Livingstone visited Lake Nyassa, ascended the Shire River and took possession of the valley landscapes of this river and its tributaries to the east and west of the Nyassa on behalf of the Portuguese government. 4. that Livingstone's journey to the Shire and Nyassa in 1859 was based on the information given to him by the Portuguese, and was carried out with their assistance, so that the famous Scottish traveler did not discover the Nyassa, but that he only visited it at a place pointed out to him by the Portuguese and to which they had shown him the way 5. That from the 16th century to the present day, it was the Portuguese who traveled through the lands east of Lake Ryassa and between it and the coast, keeping the tribes living there under their sovereignty by carrying out acts of sovereign authority and considering the present province of Kay Delgado as extending to the shores of Lake Nyassa. 6. that all those landscapes between Lake Nyassa and the Indian Ocean, between Lake Nyassa and Lake Bemba, between Lake Nyassa and the Zambezi were traversed by many Portuguese expeditions, several of which were sent with the express mission of proclaiming Portugal's sovereignty over the peoples living there and of obtaining more detailed information about the said territories. Someone may ask why we are dealing so closely with these matters, which after all primarily concern Portugal and England. The answer to this is that we should be careful at times to counter the dangers that may threaten us from the English in the future. If the well-known agreement of 1886 on the German and English spheres of interest had been made by the German government with foresight of a possible later clash of interests, the dispute over the Beledsoni Canal, which the British East African Company is said to have occupied by force of arms, while there has been no word of any intervention by the German government to protect the Sultan of Witu, would be impossible today. We find the English at work annexing Mashonoland, the Shire and Nyassa, disregarding the claims of the Portuguese; following in the footsteps of their missionaries, we will soon see them politically active on Nyassa and Victoria Nyanza. Their actions against Portugal show that there is every reason to be wary of them. When the English missionary interest in Tanganyika and at the southern end of the Victoria Nyanza has become powerful and English trade in these regions has gained a firm foothold, following the example of the missionary activity on the Shire and Ryassa, we Germans will also be faced with the task of how we must counter Euglian desires for exploitation in our sphere of interest; We must seize this time, which is probably the last for acquisitions, and we must not turn our gaze away from the African situation. Even if other colonial territories, Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay, are now somewhat underestimated, we must bear in mind that there is not much more to be done in this respect in a few years' time. What used to take decades is now the work of a few years, what used to seem impossible is now a trifle. We would deplore it as an unparalleled short-sightedness if the German side were to neglect now to establish what should rightly be ours, if we were to be guided in our restraint by the consideration that there is sufficient scope for our development in East Africa for the next hundred years. East Africa will remain a trading colony for the time being; whoever has the power controls the trade. Why, for example, does German power not at least penetrate over to Tabora, which has a dominant and ever-growing importance as the center of the great caravan routes? Why is Karema not reoccupied? Why is something not spent on establishing commercial-scientific stations, as we would like to see in East Africa, which is so important, and why do we not try to secure the most important caravan routes in the East for the future?
A letter from Professor Dr. Schweinfurth. We are reprinting below a letter from Professor Schweinfurth to the editor of this newspaper, which, following on from earlier essays by Paul Reichard published in the "Deutsche Kolomalzeitung", contains some details about our relationship with the natives and the Arabs, which are of great interest at the present time due to the author's deep knowledge of the Arab character. Professor Schweinfurth writes from Cairo on 15 January: "I have rarely read anything with regard to practical proposals for tropical African colonization work that corresponded so closely to my own experiences gained in a completely different quarter of the African continent as the article by Fr. Reichard*) (in No. 10 and 11 of the D. Kol.=Ztg.) I would like to subscribe to everything that Mr. Reichard, based on long experience and careful consideration, says about the treatment of the heathen natives (I prefer this term to the word "Reger"). In the present case, seemingly trifling extravagances, such as the wearing of European dress, communal meals and the like, are incalculable conditions. What Mr. Reichard has said about the use of white non-commissioned officers may well be partially qualified, since our own military must already have had decisive experience in this respect; the idea that there are also high and low among the whites can do no harm to general discipline, nor to the instinctive feeling of unconditional subordination of the black to the white. Mr. Reichard hits the nail on the head when he lets the whole difficulty of our task in East Africa culminate in the question: Why are we unable to do what the Arabs were able to do so easily? Anyone who could find a definitive solution to this problem would have discovered the key to all our East African future calculations, the key to all our cultural tasks there. Mr. Reichard emphasizes our constant ignorance of the conditions, customs and traditions of the natives as the main reason for the failure of our undertakings; but he will have to admit that the Arabs are not at all superior to us in this respect. In his further remarks, the experienced man did not fail to prove to us that the main reason is that we do not know how to assert our authority in a way that is convincing for the natives alone. The contrast can be illustrated in two words, which Father Reichard also quotes: the Arabs collect tribute, the Europeans want to pay everything and often impose themselves with their gifts. Tribute, taxes, forced labor: these are the true pledges of obedience. Mr. Reichard rightly and justifiably separates the Arab question from our tasks with regard to educating the blacks to work; the former will not be able to prevent us from doing so. The importance of Arabism, however, has increased immeasurably due to the revitalizing warlike spirit of resistance, and it is now a matter of finding the right moment to put a stop to the tide of war, when the redeeming word "enough" should be called. That will be left to Major Wißmann; it could be a very bad idea for Europe to speak out. But the moment will come. The Mohamedans' blind fatalism and their exaggerated monotheism, which paralyzes every right to self-determination and the willpower of man, cause them to reject the duty of gratitude; therefore, the Arabs can never be won over or reconciled through charity and generosity. On the other hand, their fatalism also has the advantage for us that they are not as devoted to feelings of blind vindictiveness as many Christian peoples. If we hanged Bushiri, we did it because it was God's will. He must have deserved it. Therefore, Bushiri's former followers need not all be our irreconcilable enemies. As long as we are careful not to deceive ourselves into thinking that we can permanently make the Mohammedans our sincere friends, it is worth the effort, *) This judgment is all the more important as Paul Reichard has often enough been denigrated in missionary journals. For example, the mission inspector F. M. Zahn recently wrote in an original article about the missionary Arnot in the Allgemeine Missionszeitschrift (January 1890): "It is very regrettable that men like Paul Reichard, who can only carry out their explorations in Africa with bloodshed, are allowed to act as advisors at home on how to treat Africans, free and slave.

to take them as they are, as true fatalists; they will then submit without will to the violence once they have achieved victory, and in their outward conduct will display that correctness which the French government (the French rightly boast: we are the only government which Islam, if it does not recognize, at least accepts) in North Africa so highly prides itself on, and which is demanded of "peaceful citizens" everywhere. The resentment against Christianity in its Frankish form will continue to smoulder under the ashes for an unforeseeable time, but the outward reconciliation lies in the peculiar kind of devotion to God that is characteristic of the Mohammedan religion. Christians are given the present, they become our masters; through the whole world of Iolam, however, their kingdom is only of this world. Those who enjoy all temporal advantages hereafter will come away empty-handed with the inheritance of paradise. Let us resign ourselves for the short span of time we have to run through on earth; there in the hereafter we are the masters. And finally, one day everyone will have to come together in Mecca to confess the truth. This is the judgment of the devout Mohamedan, and therein lies reconciliation with our time and the possibility of a lasting compromise. Colonial aspirations in England. By Professor W. Schaefer. III. Scientific training of colonists. We Germans are still so much in the infancy of colonization that we will hardly recognize the scientific education of colonists as one of its requirements for the time being - despite our other preference for teaching systems of all kinds. We start from the premise that the colonist must learn most things in the school of life, namely in the colonies themselves, that the uneducated of our emigrants have the average advantage over the educated of not having to unlearn in the colonies many things that were considered necessary education in the homeland, and that they can therefore settle into the new conditions, which preferably require physical labor, all the more easily. This view, however, which applies to the great majority of expatriates, does not take into account the fact that even sons of better families, without having failed here and being forced by exceptional circumstances to attend the hard school of life in the colonies, can make it their life's occupation to cultivate a large estate in overseas countries. In fact, this rarely happens in our country. Apart from failed existences, for whom there can be no question of any planned training for the colonies anyway, we usually send educated merchants, technicians, etc. across the ocean for a limited period of time, but almost never educated farmers. If they only have a small amount of money, which is not sufficient for the difficult conditions of our agriculture, but would be sufficient in other countries, then they generally prefer to increase the overwhelming competition in state and municipal service, insurance and commercial positions here. It is different in England, where the annual population increase of 400,000 souls has imposed itself much more frighteningly on the people's consciousness than the unfrugal increase of over half a million souls suggests to our countrymen not to cling too anxiously to the clod. In England, according to W. Roscher (Kolonien, Kolonialpolitik und Auswanderung, 3rd ed. p. 301), it is the indigent semigentility, the sons of the poorer clergymen, the half-soldiers, the smaller lawyers, doctors, merchants, factors, the younger sons of the less wealthy landowners, etc., who are still so strongly drawn to the colonies, who still flow off to the colonies to such an extent that in many towns the majority of families of 30 to 70 L house rent have a son in the East Indies, Australia, etc. "The cessation of this outflow would in a few ages accumulate a terrible army of discontent. When such youths, who have not hitherto lacked the comforts and better education so common in England, decide to emigrate, they do so, of course, only on the supposition that they will be masters in a foreign country from the outset, for which the establishment of their own estates, as farmers or cattle breeders, haciendero or plantation owners, is the most suitable means. The idea of attending an agricultural school before their departure, and preferably one where they could already learn something about farming in the colonies, was therefore an obvious one. Under these circumstances, the "Colonial College and Training farms", founded in January 1887 by a limited company in Hollesleybay, Suffolk, seems to have met a real need felt in England. As far as we can see, the poor press has spoken out in favour of the new facility, and the reporters sent by all the newspapers to inspect it have often repeated the statement that we first found in the magazine "Capit and Colonization": "Just the thing that is wanted originally calculated for only about 40 pupils has soon proved to be too small, and preparations are currently being made for extensive new buildings. In the first annual report, particular emphasis is placed on the fact that many older colonists, who have retired to England with the fruits of their hard work, entrust their sons, who are destined for a similar career, to the Institute as pupils. The Colonial College is partly an agricultural school and partly an association of young gentlemen who seek to prepare themselves for their common profession by appropriate employment in a model farm, by acquiring the small skills necessary for colonist life and by steeling their nerves with the customary sports of the country. The scientific instruction given by 6 different teachers extends to agriculture and forestry, geology and mineralogy, botany, surveying and architecture, veterinary medicine and bookkeeping. After a single visit to the institution, we are not in a position to judge the nature and success of this instruction. However, it is clear from the printed list of questions which the pupils had to answer in the summer examination of this year that the above-mentioned sciences were only an introduction to the first basics, with special consideration given to the needs of colonist life. It can also be concluded from the fact that only two hours a day are set aside for all of these subjects that there is no danger of overburdening them with academic knowledge. If the syllabus had not been drawn up with exclusive consideration of the immediate benefit, then, according to German opinion, lectures with a general educational content, e.g. a historical, geographical or ethnographic overview of the most important colonies, should not have been missing. The main value of the course should consist in the practical instruction related to the management of the estate belonging to the company. This estate, situated in a charming, hilly landscape on a small river which flows into the sea half an hour away, contains, with the inclusion of 500 acres of leased land, 1830 acres of partly very fertile arable land and good meadows as well as deciduous and coniferous woodland and also a wide variety of soils, to be able to survey the different types of soil at a glance, large areas of heathland, which are only useful for the grazing flocks of sheep and for the bees swarming out, directly adjoining the lush vegetable and flower gardens, which surround the estate and school buildings within high taxus hedges. Here, under the supervision of the estate managers, the students learn to plow, plant, sow and carry out all the harvesting work found on an English estate. In livestock breeding, however, they gain even more extensive experience than would be possible in an ordinary farm, because the livestock, especially among the sheep, whose breeding is such a rich source of prosperity in the Australian colonies, is made up of a wide variety of breeds. There is also a large dairy, for which cows of various breeds provide the milk. However, the fact that the entire facility is not intended for prospective farmers and cattle breeders, but for future colonists, becomes even clearer when you enter the workshops for carpenters and boat builders, rough and nail smiths, saddlers and wheelwrights. Here, under the supervision of suitable inspectors, you see the students engaged in the most varied tasks that only the solitary life of a colonist could require. Nothing seems to have been forgotten to make the lack of craftsmen less noticeable to the future farmer in the wilderness; we even saw the cheerfully busy students soling shoes and sewing buttons onto clothes. It is said to be a special treat for them when they are allowed to cut down trees according to a predetermined plan and build a log cabin out of them. If someone is injured or wounded in the process, it is a welcome opportunity for the others to show off their skills in applying bandages and other aid, which they are taught by a practical doctor in a special course. In addition, household skills, cooking and bread baking, even knitting and embroidery are taught. In the nurseries, great importance is attached to the planting of hedges and fences. The training of the physical dexterity necessary for colonists also seems to us to be very fortunate through the diligent cultivation of the

Page 32

English youth so dear to the sport of riding and rowing. The nearby moorland encourages racing, the Alde river rowing and the nearby sea sailing. But strict care is taken to ensure that the pleasurable is always combined with the useful. The horses are to be looked after by the students themselves, shod in the smithy and treated in case of illness. Rowing is combined with swimming lessons, as well as instruction in how to open flying bridges, and the capsizing of a boat is often deliberately induced in order to test the occupants' presence of mind and to teach them the appropriate rescue measures in such cases. The sailing boats have to be equipped and maintained by the students themselves, and in the large boathouse there is a workshop where sails are mended and tarred and all parts of the rigging are repaired. The principal, Mr. Robert Johnson, a stout figure, with an expression of great strength of will in his coarse face, which is shone through by a pair of witty eyes, seems to be held in high esteem by his pupils. The house rules are very strict. After 9 o'clock in the evening no student may be absent from the rooms of the college without leave, at 10 o'clock everyone must be in his simply furnished room and at 10½ o'clock all lights must be extinguished. Attendance at the Sunday service in the nearby village church and the home devotions held on some days of the week is required unless parents or guardians have forbidden it, although this is said to have happened in only a few cases Refreshments are only served in the communal dining room. Spirits are not tolerated anywhere, and smoking within the buildings is restricted to a smoking room. Smoking is also not permitted outside at work. In an English institute, of course, there is also a ban on betting, although this is probably the ban that is most often circumvented. Penalties are: Fines, reprimands and removal. Every pupil has to keep a diary in which, in addition to recording the work assigned to him or undertaken by him on his own initiative for his education, he should also write about the observations made on the estate, in the reading rooms and in the workshops. These diaries are regularly checked by the designated teachers and members of the administration. The academic year is divided into two semesters of 20 weeks, beginning in February and August each year, with vacations in midsummer and at Christmas, and 2 years or 4 semesters are considered necessary for a complete education. Of course, the length of stay is left up to the pupils or their families, and no special requirements seem to be made with regard to the previous education of the pupils to be admitted; only a certificate of previous good conduct is required. The price for board and tuition is 80 guineas per year for pupils under 17 years of age, 100 guineas for those between the ages of 17 and 20 and 120 guineas for older pupils, who seem to make up the majority of the latter. In addition, 2 guineas a year for laundry. According to these high prices, the pupils of the Colonial College seem to come from even higher social circles than those which, according to Roscher, we have described above as the main sources of educated emigrants. In our country, most of them would be officers or bright students, and we must not think for a long time that young people for whom more than 2000 marks in board money can be paid will learn bread baking, horseshoeing, boot soling etc. One could perhaps try to justify this reluctance of our educated youth to take up the profession of a practical farmer in overseas countries, which for many is certainly far more rewarding than the prospects here, by arguing that the prospects of a German colonist cannot be compared with those of an English colonist, since the latter, as the son of the world-dominating Albion, would to a certain extent only move to remote areas of his own fatherland. But if our needs and aims, which are so different from those of the English, require any justification at all, the one I have just indicated may not be the most convincing. The English do not colonize their own colonies as numerously as is generally believed. According to the "Deutsche Rundschau für Geographie und Statistik" (November 1889), 398,494 people emigrated from Great Britain in 1888, including those from other countries, compared with 396,494 in the previous year. Of these, 293,087 went to the United States of North America, 49,107 to British America, 31,725 to Australia, 5,164 to the East Indies, 1,787 to the West Indies, 7,705 to the Cape of Good Hope and Ratal, 5,949 to Central and South America and 3,970 to other places. Although these statistics do not provide a measure of English emigration as such, since they include the nationals of other nations transported from English ports, they do indicate the maximum number of Englishmen who went to their colonies, among whom, incidentally, there will also be nationals of other nations, and this maximum is hardly ¼ of those who have emigrated to the United States and other independent countries The Colonial College keeps an exact record of the whereabouts of the former pupils, just as the intention existed from the outset and still exists to combine teaching with a mediation and information office for the prospective colonists. During its one and a half years of existence, the Institute has not yet been able to accumulate any statistical material of significance, but we can see from the information given to us that several of the former pupils have turned to the United States of North America, Brazil, Argentina, etc. as negative emigrants, as we would call them here, not to say as peoples' fertilizers, while the majority, however, have gone to the English colonies. The fact that we do not, like the English, already have arable farming colonies that invite further settlement and, for the time being, not even advanced plantation colonies, cannot prevent us from raising the question of whether something could be done to train colonists in Germany! We are thinking less of our student youth, although an outflow of our educated proletariat would be a highly desirable goal. We can only think of those circles in which the impulse to emigrate is already present without encouragement from any quarter, i.e. smaller farmers, insofar as they do not belong to the uneducated peasantry and day laborers, especially younger sons of larger farmers who are compensated with a sum of money by the farm heir. These have often received such an education at our excellent agricultural schools that they can probably do without the lectures given at the English Colonial College. For many other aspects of English "training" they have a substitute in our incomparable school of military service. But what they lack is practical instruction in the knowledge and skills necessary for colonial life. In order to acquire this, they would perhaps like to work on an estate for one or two years free of charge or for a small apprenticeship fee, if this could give them the impression of an overseas economy. Shouldn't the reclamation of an area of woodland in the Lüneburg Heath, for example, combined with the very rewarding cattle breeding there, offer many points of contact, the skillful use of which could represent a piece of colonist life in Germany? If a society were to acquire such an area of land, it could achieve the dual purpose of firstly training colonists and secondly creating a larger estate cheaply and free of charge, using older colonists, some of whom have returned to us, especially from the western United States and the La=plat countries, and who would of course first and foremost need to have a certain teaching ability. In the publications of the Colonial College it is presented as a special advantage that the living together of many young men leads to friendship alliances which make group emigration possible. We would hardly have believed that this small, incidental advantage would be so much emphasized in England. For us it would carry much more weight, because our emigration is by no means so purposeful and regulated. For us, the mediation and information office, which is necessarily connected with the education system, would also become more important, because we are still sorely lacking such an institution, which is purely business-like, yet operated with honesty and expertise. Although the English college cannot serve as a model for our different needs, the idea behind its establishment will also have to be implemented in Germany one day.

of those who had even a superficial knowledge of the colonial undertakings of this prince and his successor. In the meantime, the acquisition of overseas possessions by Germany has understandably refreshed the memory of these bold undertakings. In recent times, various writings and treatises on the subject have appeared. (Cf. Kol.=Ztg. 1884 p. 197 ff.) However, all of these publications only deal with individual aspects or sections of Brandenburg's colonial policy, or only provide a more or less brief and condensed overview of it. A detailed, source-based and, as far as the available or accessible documentary material allowed, complete account of the colonial plans and undertakings of the Great Elector and his son, however, is provided by the aforementioned work by Schück, the first volume of which contains the systematic account, which will be discussed in more detail immediately, while the second volume provides the documentary evidence that forms the basis for the systematic account. Here, under 194 numbers, 213 documents (reports, memoranda, instructions, plans, correspondence, company oktrois and regulations, contracts with regent chiefs, statements of account, receipts, etc.) from the period 1647-1722 are printed, of which 167 documents found in the archives of Berlin, Aurich and Emden are published for the first time. This brief indication alone suggests the wealth of new material that the author has contributed to a full understanding of Brandenburg-Prussian colonial policy, but the content of the documents, all of which are important and significant, is clear. Only on the basis of this rich material was it possible to give an essentially exhaustive account of the colonial plans and undertakings of the Great Elector, whereas all older writings on this subject are incomplete and incomplete. As far as the first, systematic part is concerned, the author first gives a brief introduction with some notes on Brandenburg's trade in the 16th and up to the middle of the 17th century and then moves on in the first chapter to an account of the Great Elector's first colonial plans. The second chapter mentions the efforts of this prince to create a navy, while the third chapter contains a detailed account of the origins and activities, as well as the demise of the Brandenburg African Company and thus of Brandenburg-Prussian colonial enterprises in general. The legal relationships of the African Company are discussed in more detail in an appendix. The fourth chapter gives an overview of the Brandenburg colonies in Africa (Axim and Taccarary on the Gold Coast and Arguin south of Cape Blanco), their size, their inhabitants, their administration and their fates. Finally, a second appendix provides information on the trial of the first and only naval and colonial minister of Brandenburg-Prussia, as we can call him, the Dutchman Benjamin Raule, and the last years of the life of this remarkable man, who was the main collaborator of the Great Elector in his undertakings. Considering the miserable economic state Brandenburg found itself in after the devastation of the Thirty Years' War, one would think that the idea of a colonial policy would have been out of the question for the Great Elector. However, the far-sighted prince thought differently, he was of the opinion that he could best help his country, which had been shattered by the war, by promoting "seafaring and trade. Therefore, he strove with all his might for the possession of Pomerania and the Oder estuaries in order to provide Brandenburg, which was cut off from the sea, with free access to the sea, and he was always inclined to enter into colonial ventures in order to secure his state a share in world trade and in the newly discovered countries in India and America before the other seafaring rations had completely distributed the "new" world among themselves. The Elector's hope of acquiring Pomerania in the Peace of Westphalia was, of course, not fulfilled. Nevertheless, in the period from 1647-1652, the bold plan of a Brandenburg-East India Company emerged, for the implementation of which the Elector contacted Admiral Aernoult Gijsels van Lier, formerly in the service of the Dutch East India Company, and took him into his service. Gijsels, an enterprising man familiar with East Indian affairs, presented the Elector with the advantages of founding a Brandenburg-East India Company for the purpose of trading with India and establishing colonies. The Elector agreed to this proposal, issued an octroi for the new company, initiated negotiations for the abolition or reduction of the Sund duty for his or the company's ships and then endeavored for five years, unfortunately in vain, to actually bring the company into being. Despite all his efforts, the plan failed because the Elector did not find the necessary support either from the Hanseatic cities or from his own subjects. In 1675, on the occasion of the Swedish war, the Great Elector became acquainted with the ship's captain Benjamin Raule, councillor and alderman of Middelburg, who offered to attack the Swedes at sea with ten frigates under the Brandenburg flag in response to the Elector's commission letters (letters of marque) if the Elector wanted to protect him against possible persecution by the States General. The Elector agreed to Raule's proposal, and as his enterprise was favored by fortune, he repeatedly concluded contracts with him, the content of which included Raule placing ships at the Elector's disposal for warlike undertakings, until on October 1, 1684, the Elector was able to purchase from Raule a further nine warships with a total of 176 cannons in addition to the one warship belonging to him that had been taken from the Spaniards at the time. Thus, after many efforts, the Elector had finally succeeded in creating his own fleet for his state, which was intended to provide protection and support for the colonial ventures, but of course only lasted as long as these ventures did. It was Raule, who had been appointed Electoral Councillor in 1676, later Director of Ships and finally Director General of the Navy, who now prompted the Elector to consider new colonial ventures. As early as 1676, Raule had pointed out the advantages of trading with Guinea, and in 1679 he suggested to the Elector that he lend his protection to a Guinean company. This company was first to trade with two ships, to Guinea and Angola, and was to be granted exclusive privileges for 25 years. The Elector was only required to provide eight cannons bearing his coat of arms and 15 soldiers for the defense of the ships, to contribute 10,000 thalers and to grant the company four years of license freedom for incoming and outgoing goods; in return, the appointment of the president of the company was to be left to him. The Elector initially tried to arouse interest in this enterprise among his subjects, but in vain; neither in Brandenburg, Prussia nor Cleve=Mark was there any greater understanding for the Prince's colonial plans than an age earlier. As a result, the first African expedition undertaken under the protection of the Great Elector with two ships in 1680 was entirely at the expense and risk of Raules and his associates. The Elector was only involved in the expedition by providing soldiers, but he allowed the expedition to appear to the world as if it had been undertaken by him alone. The expedition had no luck, however; this was due to the petty jealousy of the States General towards the Elector's nascent navy and their resentment that he was using Dutch forces to carry out his colonial plans. They therefore issued a proclamation (October 8, 1680) prohibiting all Dutch subjects from accepting foreign service and from acquiring foreign letters of marque damaging the ships of the Republic, recalling all Dutchmen in foreign service, and renewing earlier prohibitions that no one within the territories assigned to the East India Company and the West India Company by their octrois was to serve foreign rulers. As a result, the commander of the West India Company in Guinea confiscated one of the ships equipped by Raule, for which compensation could only be obtained after lengthy negotiations. Just as the Dutch West India Company opposed the Elector's colonial ventures because it considered itself disturbed by them in an area which it had previously regarded as its exclusive domain, the English also felt uneasy when the rumor arose that Brandenburg wanted to send ships to the Davis Strait. Nevertheless, the Elector was not deterred from pursuing his colonial plans. On May 16, 1681, the captain of the second ship of the aforementioned expedition, which had happily returned home after completing its task, had concluded a treaty with three Negro chiefs in the area between Axim and the Kay of the Three Points (tres puntas) on the Gold Coast, according to which they undertook not to trade with anyone other than the Elector's subjects, to arrange for the towns in the vicinity to do likewise and to designate a suitable site for the construction of a fortress. This was at least the first step towards the acquisition of a Brandenburg colony in Africa, and the Elector now took the liberty of issuing the "Edict on the Octroirung der

Page 34

to be established on the coasts of Guinea", thus creating the basis for the future company. It was now a matter of raising the capital of 50,000 thl, which was considered necessary for the beginning, to organize the company, whose first partners, apart from the Elector, the Elector Prince and Raule, were mainly a number of higher officials and officers, and to equip an expedition, which was successful after much effort, Major Otto Friedrich von der Gröben was assigned as the Elector's special commissioner with the task of renewing the treaty concluded with the three Negro chiefs, left Europe in May 1683 and arrived happily at its destination. Here, in accordance with his commission, Gröben took possession of an advantageous point on the Kay of the Three Peaks, despite a protest from the Dutch West Indian colony, hoisted the Brandenburg flag there on New Year's Day 1683 and gave the young settlement, for the protection of which the construction of a fortress was soon begun, the auspicious name of Groß=Friedrichsburg. On November 18 of the same year, the Elector had issued an octroi supplementing the edict of March 17, 1682, which granted the company numerous privileges and established the basic features of its constitution. Of much greater importance for the Company, however, was the fact that the Elector succeeded in forging links with the East Frisian estates, which were at odds with their sovereigns, gaining a firm foothold in Emden, concluding a trade and shipping agreement with the East Frisian estates and finally persuading the East Frisians to make substantial contributions to the Company. As a result, the company's headquarters were moved to Emden, a city whose excellent harbor offered completely different advantages for trade than the ports on the Baltic Sea, which were unfavorable for world trade. However, the relocation of the company's headquarters to Emden and the participation of the East Frisian estates by no means eliminated all difficulties; the yield of the first expedition had been much lower than had been hoped. In order to equip a second expedition, money had to be raised on credit. In general, it became necessary to increase the share capital and to gain new partners for this purpose. Given the lack of interest and understanding in Germany for colonial ventures, this was no small task, and it was therefore a great stroke of luck for the company that Elector Maximilian Heinrich of Cologne could be persuaded to contribute 24,000 thalers. All sorts of plans were also considered to bring money into the company through profitable ventures, until it was finally decided, like other seafaring nations, to engage in the advantageous slave trade, which is of course viewed with different eyes today than two hundred years ago, when the shameful nature of this trade had not yet been recognized, or at least not to the same extent. In order to be able to successfully undertake the slave trade to the West Indies, it was necessary to acquire a secure export location in America. After lengthy negotiations, a treaty was concluded with Denmark on November 24, 1685, according to which the company was granted a trading post on the island of St. Thomas, subject to the sovereignty of the King of Denmark. In this way, the African Company had opened up a trade route to America. However, it had already succeeded in expanding its African territory before this. The commanders of the fortress Groß=Friedrichsburg had concluded treaties with the surrounding free tribes and brought the village of Accada under the Elector's protection in the spring of 1684 and Taccarary the following year. In December 1687, the company finally succeeded in acquiring the small island of Arguin, located to the south-east of Cape Blanco in West Africa. However, there was no end to the difficulties the company had to contend with. The Dutch West India Company continued its hostilities and once again took away a ship from the Brandenburg Company, while another, in order to avoid the same fate, had to return to Emden without having achieved anything, just as Portuguese ships were chased away from the Groß=Friedrichsburger Rhede, where they wanted to trade with the commander; It is understandable that this caused great damage to the company. Disputes also arose with the French Senegal Company, because the latter claimed the exclusive right to trade in the Gambia and therefore confiscated a ship belonging to the company that violated its alleged privilege. In addition, the Company's officials in the African colonies were not always efficient and reliable and were often detrimental to the Company's interests. Under these circumstances, it could not be surprising that the East Frisians became highly displeased, so that the Elector, in order to prevent a possible collapse of the Company caused by the East Frisians' behavior, was persuaded at Raule's insistence to compensate the East Frisians from his own funds. After the departure of the dissatisfied East Frisian element, the company took a surprising upswing for a while, as evidenced by a balance sheet dated Emden, April 14, 1687, but this favorable situation did not last long, for as early as March 1688, news arrived that the Dutch General de Sweers had attacked Accada and Taccarary the previous October, dragged off the officers and men as prisoners and taken all the goods and ammunition. He had also threatened to incite the regiments against Groß=Friedrichsburg and had in fact blocked this place by cordoning off all entrances. The Elector, most painfully affected by this news, had the States General demand the return of the places and compensation and was determined to obtain satisfaction by all means. His death on May 9, 1688, however, put an end to all his colonial plans. The Great Elector's son and successor, Frederick III, the future King Frederick I, had every intention of continuing the colonial policy initiated by his father. He also managed to ensure that in 1600 the Brandenburg Company was at least partially compensated for the disadvantages inflicted on it by the West India Company (in June 1688 a Brandenburg ship had been captured by the Dutch) and that Accada was also returned, while Taccarary, of course, remained in the hands of the Dutch. However, the decline of African society is unmistakable from now on. Although some expeditions were still equipped and new colonial ventures were even planned, such as the founding of an American company that wanted to establish trading posts in Darien, to which Spain, however, laid claim, no further significant successes were achieved. The finances of the African Company continued to decline, although Frederick himself used his credit to provide it with funds; a lawsuit was initiated against Raule and his patron, Minister von Danckelmann, for alleged embezzlement to the detriment of both the Company and the state treasury, although it was later dismissed. Thomas, the Danes were hostile to the Company; Accada was temporarily lost to the Dutch and English in a war with hostile Negro tribes instigated by the latter, and finally the English government itself was hostile to the Brandenburg colonies in Africa. Therefore, when Frederick I died in 1713, he left his son and successor Frederick William I a work that had barely begun and was already close to collapse. If Frederick William I wanted to continue the colonial plans of his predecessors, he had to start from scratch in certain respects. However, he had no desire to do so, albeit for valid reasons; "for important, well-considered reasons" he decided instead to sell the possessions in Africa and the branches in St. Thomas and Emden with all their accessories. After repeated attempts to find an acceptable buyer, a contract of sale was finally concluded with the Dutch West India Company on December 18, 1717, under which the King of Prussia sold Groß=Friedrichsburg and the places around it, as well as Arguin, to the West India Company for 6000 ducats, which amount was later increased by 1200 ducats. The settlement in St. Thomas had to be ceded to the Danish West India Company without any compensation being obtained, as the latter made all kinds of claims and was supported in this by the Danish government, whereas the estate of the African Company remaining in Emden and the house belonging to it yielded about 6500 thalers. Thus there was nothing left of the colonial undertakings of the Great Elector, Frederick William 1st had given up all overseas ventures. It is worth mentioning, however, that when Frederick William I was in purchase negotiations with the West India Company, he instructed his envoy conducting the negotiations to see if the purchase contract did not include "this annoch

Page 35

to stipulate that We or Our descendants shall be at liberty, at any time or after the expiration of certain years, to redeem to Us the Forts in the state in which they are at present, against restitution of the 6000 ducats. If Brandenburg-Prussia had succeeded in retaining and expanding the colonial possessions acquired by the Great Elector, this would certainly have had the greatest influence on the economic development of Germany, and possibly also on its political development. As things stood at the time, however, such a success was not possible; the Prussian-Brandenburg state with its small population, depleted by the Thirty Years' War, and its unfavorable location on the world's oceans did not have the strength to pursue a successful colonial policy on its own. It would only have been able to do so if it had found the necessary support in the other parts of the German Empire, especially among the Hanseatic cities. But this was not the case; even in the Hanseatic cities, whose fleets had once ruled the sea, there was no more understanding for colonial ventures than, for example, in Königsberg, Berlin, Colberg or Memel, whose inhabitants, according to Raule's drastic description, "felt no inclination at all towards trade and commerce and seafaring. In addition, every step that Brandenburg-Prussia took on the path of an active colonial policy was met with the resentment and jealousy of the maritime and colonial states of the time, especially Holland, which, in a spirit of mercenary self-interest, finally put an end to the colonial creation of the Great Elector, although it owed so much to this prince. Finally, it must also be borne in mind that Prussia, which at that time was striving for advancement, was far too inhibited by the considerations of European politics to be able to move freely in overseas ventures. Thus Prussia, and with it Germany, had at first to give up the attempt to join the ranks of the colonial powers and to achieve at least as much as little Denmark and poor Sweden were able to achieve, that this prince, with his weak powers, managed to get as far as he did, for after all, the successes in colonial policy can only be attributed to the elector's strength and perseverance, who, together with his tireless and versatile colonial and naval minister Raule, procured most of the material resources required for the overseas ventures. It took almost two centuries before Prussia, at the head of a new German Empire, was able to think about acquiring German colonies again. The acquisition of colonies could now take place under completely different circumstances. The weak Brandenburgian state had been replaced by the mighty, populous and well-funded German Empire, whose sizeable fleet was able to provide the necessary protection for Germany's colonies and overseas trade, which, incidentally, no longer had to be carried out with arms in hand as it had been two centuries ago, and Germany also quickly succeeded in bringing large stretches of land in Africa and Australia under its control. And yet many things are not much better now than they were two centuries ago. It is not surprising that the colonial powers do not like to see Germany's colonial development, and that, just as Holland, England, France and Spain refused at the time to give Brandenburg even the most worthless stretch of coast and the most insignificant island if they thought they had even the remotest claim to it, so Germany has encountered resistance, especially from England, wherever it has tried to establish colonial settlements. Fortunately, the German Empire is now in a position to remove unjustified resistance in these matters. Unfortunately, however, the conditions under which the German Empire joined the ranks of colonial states a few years ago were also similar to those of two centuries ago in that the imperial government's colonial policy was not only not universally understood by the people, but even met with resistance in many cases. Since the end of the Middle Ages, we Germans had lost so much of our sense for overseas ventures that even in the Hanseatic cities the colonial policy did not find the joyful approval and energetic support that it deserved and needed. And German capital is still on the whole and on the whole hostile to colonial enterprises, and there are still Germans who note with a certain pleasure every failure in the colonial field and show a disposition to side with English adventurers and the chieftains of savage peoples who support them rather than with their own countrymen, to point out that even two centuries ago, even if only small circles in Germany clearly recognized the importance of overseas ventures and colonial possessions and that the weak Brandenburg=Prussia had the courage to undertake things that all too fearful minds still consider too dangerous for the strong German Empire James' journey into the interior of Somaliland. By L. Hirsch. The geographical results of the expedition undertaken by the Englishman James into the interior of Somaliland, which leaves the areas entered by Europeans up to then and up to now far behind, are already indicated in our more recent map works; however, this by no means exhausts our interest in an undertaking which opened up areas whose most precise knowledge can also gain practical significance, which is why there is a justified desire to be informed in more detail about the experiences of the traveler in such a remote part of the world. James published his report under the title: Tho unknoun horn of Africa, an exploration from Berbera to iho Leopard River, London 1888 in a strong, beautifully appointed volume which, in addition to the actual description of the journey, contains a valuable appendix with an expert treatment of the numerous objects collected from the animal and plant kingdom with excellent lithographic illustrations. Of great interest is the conclusion, based on the objects collected and on multiple comparisons, that the butterfly fauna of Somaliland essentially corresponds to the Arabian fauna, but that the latter seems to indicate African rather than Asian affinities. Gordon Hale, evidently based on original photographs; the addition of a larger number of the latter, however, would not have harmed the work in any way. James undertook his journey in company with four other Englishmen, including his brother and a doctor, who found ample opportunity to practise his art; they were also accompanied by two European and one Abyssinian servant. In Aden, the travelers found the then political resident, Major General Blair, accommodating and supportive in every respect. Major Hunter, one of the best connoisseurs of the Somali people and author of the most comprehensive grammar of the Somali language to date, provided sixteen reliable people whose names and tribes were registered in order to have clues in case of betrayal. In addition, he referred the travelers to No. Walsh, who was at Verbera at the time, to whom they were also highly recommended. Although James had not concealed his intended destination in Aden - reaching the Webdi Shabäl - and had been encouraged in his plans by the relevant personalities, it seems that they had reservations about the venture from the outset, even if these only became apparent after the expedition had set off. The main reason for this was probably the fact that the British power had only been in operation here for a short time and was not willing to allow itself to be forced out of the reserve it had hitherto maintained in the affairs of the Jnner by private interests. This explains Walsd's contradictory behavior. For all his kindness and courtesy, which still characterize him today at his post in Zela, the advice he gave suffered from a certain half-work and also seemed to be under the influence of some vocal natives he had taken over from the Egyptian regime. This was particularly evident in the procurement of the camels needed to carry the luggage. The question was whether it was better to buy or hire them. The former seemed questionable, for if there was no longer any substantial interest in the preservation and maintenance of the animals, apart from a lack of vigilance, it was to be feared that they would appear as good prey to the companions themselves and might disappear in the event of a cleverly improvised attack, with the lives and other property of the travelers in constant danger. It was therefore more advisable to hire the necessary animals; it was only difficult to find the people who would provide them. Even if the journey to the Ogaden and the Wedbi in Verbera, and even more so in Bulhar, is something common, these are trade journeys of the natives, while the people appearing in the company of Europeans could not know what reception the former and soon they themselves had to expect in the interior, even if they provided themselves with abbans for the tribes to be passed. This method of provisioning would, however, have been the least reasonable imaginable, for it would have left the travelers at the mercy, or rather the insolence, of each new tribe and each new people, so that even the most extensive means could not have guaranteed the achievement of the desired goal. Such a thought could not occur to a man who thought he knew the Somali people, and it must be assumed that he only made this suggestion in order to comply with certain official instructions and to put an early end to the expedition without inhibiting it.

Page 36

Through the influence of one of the people in Aden named Tualla Idris, it was finally possible to hire the necessary camels, some sixty in number, for the journey to Webbi and back for an assumed duration of 8½ months. The rental price was high, 45 dollars for each animal (here always meaning Maria=Theresiathaler) with an 18 dollar deposit; the increased security provided by this arrangement, however, was well worth the sacrifice. James had an Indian sergeant instruct the men he had brought from Aden in shooting; in addition to these and the camel drivers, one for every two animals, he also took a Somali cook, an Arab boy to help out and a number of women who had to cook for the people and furnish the huts, by which occupations the men were said to have felt degraded. James expresses his complete satisfaction with the conduct and diligence of the women, praising in particular the fact that, unlike the men, they had never quarrelled with each other, and occasionally wished that they had been accompanied by a number of brave companions. The tribes close to the coast are familiar with money, but in order not to have to carry a large amount of it with them, a sum was deposited in Walib and the payments to be made on the way were instructed to be made from it, a method that could be carried out without any particular difficulty Dates and rice were intended as food for the people, but these were intended more as a reserve in case the meat food ran out. The Somalis are somewhat particular in their choice of food; on average they have a prejudice against the meat of antelopes and gazelles and do not eat poultry of any kind at all. James also tells us that they only eat a hunted animal if its neck is cut in the name of God before it dies, and that they despise even a valuable hide as unclean if the animal was immediately dead, so that the aforementioned operation could no longer be performed on it. As a result of these personal contributions, which were only partly based on religious regulations, feeding the troops was considerably more difficult, as the abundant game could almost only be used for the Europeans' own cooking, while cattle for slaughter often had to be bought at a high price. The camels supplied were small in stature but of good appearance. Special attention had to be paid to carrying a sufficient number of water containers through the waterless Haud. Finally, everything necessary was in place and the caravan, to whose Ras the Dualla mentioned earlier was raised, was able to set off on December 21, 1884. The end point of the journey is marked on the enclosed map about five degrees of latitude south of Berbera, its starting point. This gives the average direction; however, it should be noted that the departure from Bur=o was initially south-easterly and generally more easterly, while the return was almost without deviation from the straight line in a northerly direction. The travelers left Great Dobar, 7 English miles away, to the west, whose sweet springs supply Berbera with good water by means of a water pipeline built by the Egyptians. The first camp site, Langomara, is described as a wide sandy plain flanked on both sides by 200-foot-high, wedge-shaped rocks from which miniature waterfalls stream down to fill future pools. A rich animal life could be observed here. Pavlans came to the watering place, and James shot a gerenug (Garella Waller.), a species of gazelle peculiar to the Sowali country, with a strikingly long giraffe-like neck and relatively small head; already on the way were specimens of the kudn and a smaller antelope of the same species. We had already encountered numerous specimens of the kudn and a smaller antelope of the same species called aderio, with a number of brownish stripes on both sides of the back, the small dig-dig, a sand antelope, wild boar, guinea fowl, partridges and pigeons of all kinds. The names that we find recorded as stations in the interior of the country are consistently assigned here to places where there is water and usually also better pasture. Permanent settlements are mostly found on the banks of the Webbi Schabäl and the great Webbi, where grain is cultivated and thus the basis for settlement is laid. In Langomara, the Esa Musa came to the travelers in large numbers and first demanded food, namely dates and rice, as well as the usual tribute of money, since the caravan was on their territory. They received two sheep and 50 rupees in a check on Mr. Walsh, over the distribution of which differences of opinion arose which were settled by a powerful spear thrust in the temple by a disgruntled man. The next day's route led uphill through a splendid scenery with living streams, fresh grass and green bushes; here and there fig trees, richly laden with fruit, rise up, a large pond, ten feet deep, allows a refreshing bath, a waterfall not exactly cascading down from a neck-breaking height enhances the loveliness of the picture. However, the opportunity for such attractive depictions of lively nature is rarely found, and a melancholy ode and serious austerity imprint even the most beautiful landscapes of the Jnner with their melancholy character. On Christmas Day, the travelers reached the Hammar plateau. The approach from the Edene was through a sandy gorge covered with rocks and over slippery scree, so that the camels had difficult work. The surrounding rugged mountains were richly clothed with mimosas and cacti in leaf and flower, and towering quolquols (euphorbias) stretched their branches like giant chandeliers. The camp was set up under a tamarind tree to rest here for a few days and prepare for the ascent to the final heights of the great Vergreibe, which soon connects the main plateau with the lake plain. The temperature on the plateau was very pleasant, between 23 and 13 degrees Celsius. James calls the northern Edene Gudan, the land above it Ugub. The latter is not quite correct; it bites 620, and Menges calls obn the high Edene, whose water drainage is to the south. The Somalis, however, understand by Guban the whole of the Edene, which stretches on the one hand from Berbera to Zela, and on the other about 12 hours from the seashore to the mountains. (Conclusion follows.) Correspondences. The anti-slavery conference. Brussels, January 22, 1890: The anti-slavery conference convened for the 20th of this month was unable to begin its sessions at the appointed time, as many of its members are ill. It will probably be several days before the conference can convene. The rather widespread pessimistic assessments of the practical results of the deliberations are not shared by the representatives of Great Britain. Sir John Kirk, the previous connoisseur of African conditions, is even quite sanquinistic as to the effect which the conference resolutions will have on the slave trade and on the material situation of the Negroes in general. Though individual governments, influenced by national jealousies and improperly conceived considerations of interest, may seek to impede the progress of the deliberations, these attempts at obstruction will be partially paralyzed by the first will of the others to carry out the human work of emancipation. The purpose of the Consensus is to consider and examine the proposals submitted to it for the suppression of slavery and the slave trade in Africa. In order to achieve this, it is certainly advisable, among other measures, to lay the axe to two main roots of the destruction and demoralization of the Negroes, the importation of arms and the liquor trade. The sale of European arms and ammunition to warlike tribes and slave traders encourages them in the exploitation of defenceless victims for the slave market. The consumption of alcohol weakens and morally degrades the Negro, who is incapable of defending himself in predatory raids. The question of the importation of water was on the agenda when the Conference adjourned, and will again be the first subject of discussion when it convenes. It must also be considered whether it is advisable to prohibit the importation and distribution of arms to Negroes for purposes other than slave-hunting. It is hardly feasible to declare the European arming of the indigenous peoples in the European colonies and protectorates outright illegal, because each individual government will be forced to form an indigenous force for the protection and defense of the population within its borders, which can hardly be equipped with primitive African weapons. In any case, it is a duty to strictly prohibit the clandestine and unauthorized sale of European weapons to notorious slave hunters or to tribes who regard slave raiding and slave trading as a premeditated means of enrichment and territorial expansion. Unfortunately, many merchants on the coast, particularly in the British and especially in the Portuguese possessions, are so greedy for profit that they make common cause with the slave hunters out of business interests, supply them with weapons, and even facilitate the sale of their black goods. In 1885, Consul Hawes found a troop of 1200 slave children of both sexes on the property of a rich Portuguese in the province of Mozambique under the guard of Nrabans. However, this disregard for human duty out of self-interest was not limited to the traders on the African coast; it also came to light among the merchants of Birmingham. The arms merchants there, who have among the slave traders the purchasers for their flintlock rifles, which are manufactured in vast quantities for Africa and yield enormous profits, worked through their representative Chamberlain to persuade the Salisbury Cadet not to agree to the Belgian application, and they would have achieved their purpose had Sir John Kirk not stood up for the ban on arms imports with the full force of his authority. As to the prohibition of the importation of spirits, I concur in Kirk's opinion, that a total prohibition of them would be an innocent but grievous injury to the merchants and distillers, especially those of Hamburg. Everywhere on the coast where the consumption of spirits has become naturalized, the craving for spirituous beverages will not be eradicated by draconian legislation; if the native can no longer satisfy his passion with the German product, care will be taken to establish distilleries in the colonies and protectorates. Sugar cane, bananas and the like provide excellent substitutes for grain and potatoes. The German industry will be damaged, and the only result obtained will be that the Negro will feast his thirsty soul on native instead of European liquor. A general agreement to prohibit, under heavy penalties, the introduction of alcoholic beverages into regions not yet contaminated by this vice would be much more effective and only right. A trader who introduces spirits into the interior as an article of drink should be punished with imprisonment and expelled from the colony, for all Negro chiefs are not Khama, who has forbidden the introduction of spirituous liquors into his territory and prefers seeds to powder. The consumption of spirits on the coasts would be duly restricted by high import duties, such as those existing in the English colony of Lagos, and at the same time provide the national administration with desirable funds for public works.

Two dangerous pitfalls for the conference are the right to search ships and the amendment of the Congo Act to allow the Congo State to introduce import duties. In and of itself, an agreement could probably be reached on these points, too, if France did not seize every opportunity to thwart practical results, in disregard of the outstanding role played by England and Germany at the Congress. Even the interference of the Birmingham industrialists was due to the tactless discretion of the French envoy Bourrae, who broke his word and communicated the Belgian proposals to the French press in order to create a mood against them The political grouping of the European powers meant that Russia agreed with France's rejection of the right to search ships, as both states saw this as a "disturbance of maritime traffic". Portugal expresses similar reservations. The introduction of import duties in the Congo State met with resistance from most of the states interested in trade policy there, and France had already declared that it would never vote in favor of the proposal if it did not receive "appropriate compensation" for waiving its free import rights. For the Congo State, the granting of the right to levy import duties is a matter of life and death, because Belgium does not want to take on the administrative burden under any circumstances, and the Royal Civil List cannot bear the costs of the rapidly developing state system. It is regrettable that the existence of the young Congo state is so threatened from its very beginnings, but in economic matters no European state is overly considerate of the welfare of others. Great difficulties and complications, not to be underestimated, still await the Anti-Slavery Conference, the solution of which is not likely to be easy, but at any rate the Conference will do much good by directing public attention to institutions whose continued existence is a disgrace to our century. It will indicate the means which will bring about a change for the better, and if it does not succeed in giving them legal force, Europe will be enlightened as to their expediency, and public opinion in each individual State having possessions in Africa will determine the legislative bodies of that country to take the measures in question to control slavery. K.-R. Dr. C. Peters and the Ravenstein Kerte. From Mr. E. L. Ravenstein in London we receive the following letter: "In the letter which Dr. C. Peters wrote on the 8th of October from Oda Vorn Ruva on the upper Tana, there are some passages which are likely to damage my good reputation, and which, it seems, have been widely circulated in the German newspapers. Dr. Peters says ("Deutsche Kolonialzeitung" 1890. p. 2): "A steppe separates us from Massa, through which we have marched a full 72 English miles, while Ravenstein's map shows only 15 miles. Unfortunately, I have to accuse Ravenstein's map of being extraordinarily incorrect, even presumptuously frivolous "For it is truly frivolous. To draw things on a map "which no white man had previously explored, instead of admitting that we are "in unknown territory. I am convinced that the English Emin Pasha expeditions "failed" because of this "Ravenstein map. Our expedition would have paid for its reliance on it by a hair's breadth "with ruin as well. The map to which these unjustified remarks refer was published in July 1882. and as far as the Tana is concerned, it is essentially based on Denhardt's provisional map, which appeared in "Peter Mann's Mitteilungen" in 1881, supplemented by the reports of several other travelers. The places above Massa are also indicated according to Denhardt, but the distance from Massa to Oda Born Ruva on the map is not 15 miles, as Mr. Peters states, but 32. Of course, names that have been explored by everyone are also included in African maps, and in the present case this could lead to all the less misunderstanding, as "Denhardta Furthest" can be clearly read on my map. It is all the more surprising that Mr. Peters apparently did not have Denhardt's final map, published in 1884, with him, since he did meet Dendardt in Lamn. So if Mr. Peters almost starved to death on the journey from Massa to Tana, he had only his own ignorance and carelessness to thank for it. Nothing is known here in London of any English Emin Pasha expeditions that have come to grief. Hopefully cartographers will be careful not to include Dr. Peters' information about the location of Kenia obne in their maps, even if he, as an "eyewitness", estimates its distance from his camp in Oda Born Ruva to be only 7 German miles. The giant mountain lies much further inland. Furthermore, I notice a remark in an article in the "Deutsche KolonialZeitung" (1889, p. 369), which speaks of the "inaccuracies" with which my most recent map of part of East Africa was "fabricated". I can assure your readers, and my colleagues in the field have again acknowledged this, that I carry out all my work conscientiously. The boundaries shown on this map, drawn on behalf of the English East African Company, are drawn in accordance with the treaties, and in particular the northern boundary of the Witn Sultanate is drawn in accordance with an agreement reached by the German Vice-Consul Hunholt and General Matthews on January 18, 1887. The concession of the Witn Company is also indicated in exactly the same way as on the official maps of the same, or on Lieutenant von Tiedemann's map in the "Deuische Kolonialzeitung" (1889 p. 237).
As far as Mr. Ravenstein's comments against the information provided by Dr. Peters are concerned, we must reserve a rebuttal for later, when the more detailed reports of Dr. Peters and Lieutenant von Tiedemann are available. With regard to the entries on the map concerning the borders of the Witu area, we still maintain that the information is absolutely wrong, but we do not blame Mr. Ravenstein, who bona fide processed the material he was given, so much as the British East African Company. We repeat once again that the boundary line of the Sultanate of Zanzibar on Ravenstein's map, which runs from Kipini in a northerly direction 10 nautical miles into the country and passes through the middle of the territory of the German Witu=Gesellschaft, is not justified, and that it is presumptuous to designate Manda, whose affiliation is not yet certain, with the color chosen for the Sultanate of Zanzibar. It could not be the purpose of the agreement to take land from the Sultan of Witu to which the Sultan of Zanzibar had no claim. The British agreement of 1886 stipulated that the northern boundary included the village of Kau. Kau and Kipini were the outermost points of the Sultan of Zanzibar's authority towards the interior, and his soldiers did not venture beyond their borders. Shipping conditions on the East African coast. We have received the following information from Captain Holtz: Returning to the reply of Mr. v. Hake (in No. 2), I remark that such inquiries as Mr. v. Hake has made of some gentlemen engineers are not at all likely to overturn my opinion. It seems to me as if one wanted to judge the quality of coffee beans by the fat content of milk. Even shipbuilding engineers would rely on experience gained on the spot. I have specified a maximum of 4m for various reasons: The only port for which this draught is somewhat large would be Pangani. However, the export or import of goods here is by no means so significant that one would expect the ship to be fully loaded; this is already prevented by the fact that the vehicles have to approach the port at home, and furthermore, which is much more important, by the ever-increasing traffic in Tanga. It is certainly uncomfortable and also dangerous to enter the Panganl with a 4m deep loaded ship, but absolutely not necessary. It is the same for the other ports; in Tanga and Dar=es=Salaam a vessel can lie close to land, even at greater depths, but in Bagamoyo it is desirable that the draught does not exceed 4 meters, preferably a little less. Even if Mr. v. Hale gives as a reason that a 3m draught would allow a stone dam to be laid out so far that one could unload or load directly at it, I consider this to be extremely enterprising, but difficult to implement. Something like this can already be done in England, but in Bagamoyo? What means would be necessary to build such a pier of 1 nautical mile, and would it have any value at all if it were to silt up, which I cannot say, but which I suspect is due to the irregular currents and winds, as well as to the uneven ground? My view is that on a lighter, which is anchored at or near a buoy, the goods are delivered or accepted here by the arriving ships. From this lighter, small vehicles have to bring the goods ashore. If you don't want to load and unload on the beach at all times, small piers about 100 feet long are perfectly adequate, and these are not very difficult to build if you use a small light railroad. A "docking" in periods of about 2 years is necessary, because the opinion of Mr. v. Hake that all unclean soil falls off in fresh water is not quite true; because the herbs that have grown in salt water fall off in part, but the shells do not give way so easily, but are difficult to remove (only by scraping). I have defined 4 m as the maximum draught, but it is more comfortable if a loaded boat is only 3 to 31 m deep. A draught that is too shallow is definitely detrimental to the seaworthiness of the vessel. A voyage to Bombay is no more dangerous for the rheder than for the captain, whether the ship is 300 tons or 200 tons, the latter being somewhat more expensive because it can carry considerably less cargo than coal. Communications from the Company. The Society's Committee held its first meeting of the year under the chairmanship of Privy Councillor Simon on January 7. Before entering into the agenda, the chairman commemorated in serious words the heavy loss which our Royal House and the whole German country had suffered through the death of Her Majesty the Empress and Queen Dowager Augusta a few hours ago. In particular, he emphasized the tireless activity of the deceased in all areas of charitable work and especially in the area of voluntary nursing, through which our compatriots in the German colonies are also offered relief from their suffering. A motion was then submitted to Cologne, which, still in the

Page 38

was discussed at the next meeting, and a series of applications from the Berlin department. In response to Berlin's application, the committee declared itself willing to grant an initial annual sum of up to 6,000 marks for the purpose of sending medical personnel to the German colonies as soon as the German Colonial Society received duly substantiated applications. The committee considered it a desirable goal to satisfy the need for physicians to the fullest extent, but the Colonial Society could not take the initiative to send one or more physicians, since the funds available to the Society are not sufficient for a permanent budget burden of the kind described and the selection of the place where a physician is most appropriately employed is very difficult, on the natural assumption that the existing colonization societies have an equal claim to consideration. Another of Berlin's motions was to encourage the school question in German East Africa by agitation in the departments and the establishment of funds to send German teachers and set up German schools in German East Africa. The Committee did not consider that the time was yet right to settle the school question in German East Africa as long as peace in this area was not completely secured; it would be better to wait and see whether the German East African Society or the Reich would not pay the necessary attention to the establishment of schools after the political situation had been settled. The Committee is of the opinion that handicraft instruction and instruction in plantation building should form the main subjects in the curriculum of the native schools. The Committee considers it expedient to address an inquiry to the purchasing companies and ask for an expert opinion. The meeting of the Committee on January 21 was opened by the President, His Serene Highness Prince Hohenlohe=Langenburg. The committee decided on the last motion, Berlin, which, like the two previous motions, had been discussed in advance by the united Commission for Finance and Practical Colonization, that the dispatch of technicians to our colonies for scientific research, if desired, should be recommended to the Imperial Government in general, as proposed in the motion of the Berlin department, The German colonial society "Herman" had applied for the colonial society to support its enterprise by subscribing to a few shares. The committee decided to subscribe to shares to the value of 5000 marks to show the company the confidence it deserves in its honest endeavors for the benefit of German emigrants, but reserves the subscription until such time as the aforementioned sum is available from the surplus contributions for 1890 and the political conditions in Brazil have taken on a secure form. The Emigration Commission held a meeting on Monday, January 20, in which the political upheaval in Brazil was discussed in detail. The experts were unanimous in their opinion that the future development of conditions would in no way worsen the situation of the German settlers and that emigration to Brazil seemed no less advisable today than in the past, as soon as the political situation had taken a firmer shape. The report of the commission on the questionnaire concerning tropical hygiene was read out The questionnaire was approved by Professors Hirsch. Koch and Virchow, so that the Commission's work is complete. The Secretary General is entrusted with the further pursuit of the matter. Another meeting of the Committee was held on January 23 under the chairmanship of the President. At this meeting, a decision was taken on a draft letter to the Cologne Department concerning the resolution on South West Africa, and a number of business matters were dealt with. Of interest is the fact that a newly formed Austrian Africa Association has requested the advice of the German Colonial Society for its activities. - Berlin Section. On the gentlemen's evening of January 17, Captain Holtz, who commanded the "Jühlke", later the "Harmonie", spoke about his experiences during the uprising and described in a very vivid way the conditions in the ports of the East African coast, the character of the Arabs, the slave trade and slavery. He suggested that a German church should be built in Zanzibar, which would certainly have a positive effect on the Reger. Mr. Bley, the former chief on Usungula, supplemented these reports by describing his experiences and took the view of the previous speaker that the Arabs would always be our enemies and that we should therefore rely on the indigenous tribes. The tribes living close to the coast, such as the Wasaramo, were, however, wretched material, but on the Rusiji there were brave peoples who were well acquainted with the fighting style of the Masiti and who could easily be trained.
easily trained. The Wasekuma in particular are good plantation workers and are highly valued for their martial qualities. It would be possible to discipline them gradually so that the costly Zulus could be dispensed with. The discussion then turned to the question of whether Zanzibar was of great importance for us to make new and permanent investments there, or whether the coast was preferable. Although it was acknowledged that Zanzibar could not be dispensed with due to its location, the view was that the coastal ports should be developed first and foremost, especially Tanga. Pangani is a difficult entrance. Bagamovo had a dangerous rhede during the monsoon, and Dar=es=Salaam, which was otherwise favorably situated, had a bad climate, Tanga had advantages both as a port and as a military station, which held out the prospect of favorable development. In particular, the climate of Tanga, which Dr. Kohlstock reported on, was described as favourable; the camel, which would inevitably perish on the island of Zanzibar, already thrives there. But where this animal, which only thrives in drier climates, lives, the European could also exist. The Sigi River is also said to be navigable for two miles and to contain fertile farmland on its banks. There was also a good report on labor conditions. - At the lecture evening on the 24th of March, which was also attended by His Serene Highness Prince zu Hobenlohe-Langenburg, Count Joachim v. Pfeil spoke about "the Bismarck Archipelago and his experiences there in the service of the New Guinea Society" He first discussed the conditions of the country and then the situation of the inhabitants and settlers. In his opinion, the way of utilizing the land through cultivation has been solved, it is only a question of how best to use the land for the settlers. Redner first criticized the procedure of the New Guinea Company, which began with the administration before it was sure of the people and then led the attack from various points instead of concentrating on individual ones. As a result, a great fragmentation had occurred and the need to provide a connection, which is very costly. He therefore established the principle of being more careful in the choice of the starting point and pursuing a convergent system of colonization. Also, the system of forming new commercial companies among the companies without offering the large capital a guarantee of profitability was not well implemented. Redner then turned to the question of emigration and considered any definitive judgment on the possibility of bringing emigrants to New Guinea to be premature, as only the coastal fringe was known. In the interior, however, there were high mountains and it therefore appeared that the climate of the interior was similar to that of Java. For emigrants, the conditions offered by Australia, where land is almost free, and perhaps also those of New Borneo are more tempting. It was necessary to invent a system for our territories so that the land came into the hands of people who could turn it into an object of value. He suggested that a certain amount of land should be given to immigrants of a certain class free of charge, as this would attract settlers; however, certain conditions should be attached. For example, a part of the land would have to be reclaimed every year and a house built; furthermore, the settler would have to pay a tax, which he called "Favorstsassen", by analogy with the Freebolders. These settlers would have to be grouped around the central settlement so that a town could gradually develop by itself. The final condition should be that they serve in a militia. The duration of this relationship for the favorites would of course be limited, since those coming later would have to be allowed to settle under different conditions. Once such a central point had been created, big business would also move closer to it. The only question was where to get immigrants. Redner did not consider the immigration of Chinese to be unfavorable, since one of the evils, namely the presence of an indigenous population that could be spent by the Chinese, did not exist in New Guinea. The Chinese would form a good link between the indigenous population and the Euroreans. One could also localize the Chinese in order to find a certain core for industrial ventures. Redner then talks about his experiences on a trip he made to New Guinea. Based on his investigations, he considered Astrolabe Bay to be particularly suitable for settlement, as well as the Gazelle Peninsula in the Bismarck Archipelago. Magdebura Division. Under the presidency of the deputy chairman, Mr. Aldert Giesau, the department held a meeting on 9 January, which Professor Maenß opened with an overview of the colonial situation, in which he discussed the events of 1889 in detail. The board election resulted in the re-election of the current board members and the new election of Mr. Trenkmann. On 31 January, Mr. Missionssuperintendent Merensky intended to speak to the department on the topic: "What can we learn from the colonization attempts of other peoples in Africa!". Speyer Department. On January 8, the department held its second lecture evening. The first chairman of the society, seminary inspector Dr. M. Geistbeck, spoke about Canada. The lecture was very well received. Soon, on February 3, Captain v. Hale will delight the Society with a lecture. - Formation of a department in Wernigerode. On the occasion of a lecture by Dr. Kaerger on the 20th of this month, a department of our society was formed in Wernigerode, which was chaired by senior teacher Dr. Fischer. In addition to the members of the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors of the Commercial Association made a particularly valuable contribution to the establishment of the department, for which we would like to take this opportunity to express the thanks of the central management.

Small messages. - (From the German Emin Pasha expedition.) At last we received what we hoped would be certain and joyful news about the fate of the doomed Dr. Peters when the telegraph reported that he was in Suball and waiting for goods. However, the committee responsible for the business had only received a telegram from Hausing & Co. in Sausibar, which read: "Englishmen report Mombasia, Peters well in Subaki" and which was based on the news brought to Mombas by two French missionaries that they had left Dr. Peters in good health in Subaki, but there was apparently no reason to distrust this news. However, a few days later, on January 29, the executive committee of the German Emin Pasha Committee received two telegrams from Zanzibar which completely overturned these assumptions. One, posted in Zanzibar at 7:30 a.m. on January 28, came from Borchert and reported: "Reached Kenya station; Peters and Tiedemann left in good health forty days earlier at the beginning of November, passed odne Kamp Massal=Land, now already far beyond Baringo." The other telegram from Hansing & Co. in Zanzibar, sent on January 29, 8:55 a.m., reads: "Borchert krauk Lamu, French missionaries report Peters Ukamba." The country of Ukamba lies to the south of the Kenya Mountains, between them and the Subaki River. The above telegrams confirm that Petert and v. Tiedemann are alive, but they not only contradict each other with regard to their current whereabouts, but also contradict the last telegraphic message that Peters had arrived in Subaki on the Tana, where he was expecting provisions or goods. Certainty about the situation of the expedition can only be expected from further news coming from Peters himself - (A new White Paper on East Africa) was published in the Reichstag on January 16. It contains 7 reports covering the period from November 11 to January 15. The first report, dated November 20, deals with the battles at Saadani and Pangani and the action against Useguha. The report also contains more detailed information about Banaheri for the first time. According to this, the action against Banaheri began on November 5 at the request of a French mission station. Wißmann writes: "I decided to take strict action against Banaheri. After he had kept me waiting for months with peace negotiations, unfulfilled promises and lies, he offered the Bushiri, who were advancing with the Wabeha, his hand in alliance. He set the whole of Useguba in motion, built fortifications everywhere, threatened friendly chiefs and especially tried to make common cause with the great chief west of Pangani, Simbodia. He interpreted my previous patience as weakness and would become the main stronghold of the movement after the repeated defeat of Buschiri." A second report by Wissmann, dated November 20, reports on the capture and fortification of Mkwadja, the punishment of Klpumbwe, and the dispatch of Baron von Gravenreuth to secure the road from Mywapwa to Bagamovo. In the report, Wißmann also informs us that he has issued a proclamation restricting the traffic of the Arab Dhaus to certain ports. There was no fear that these measures would damage trade. In a third report dated November 28, Wißmann informs us that Simbodja, the largest chief of the Pangani tribe, has begun negotiations for peace. The whole of northern Usagara had broken away from Banaheri. The biggest chiefs from there had come to Pangani themselves. The report also contains information about the preparations for Buschiri's capture. Buschiri seems to want to escape to the English protectorate. On the basis of the report, Wißmann considers more serious hostilities in the northern part of our protectorate to be unlikely. A telegram from Wißmann dated December 20 reports the arrival of Stanley and Emin Pasha in Mywaywa. The White Book also contains two reports by Lieutenant Schmidt from Mywapwa about the arrival of Stanley and Emin there. Lieutenant Schmidt reports, among other things, that Emin had to leave his ivory supplies behind due to a lack of porters. Some of these have been handed over to reliable chiefs for storage, others have been dumped in the river. The White Book also contains a letter from Emin to Major Wißmann from Mpwapwa dated November 11. In the letter Emin expresses his thanks for the welcome he has received in Mywaywa. In a telegram dated December 16, Wißmann reports that Bushri has been defeated. The White Book contains the following telegram from Wissmann about a defeat of the Germans on December 25: "Part of my expeditionary force attacked Bana=Herl on December 25, but was repulsed, with Sergeant Ludwig and 8 men killed and 6 wounded. On January 5, I stormed the strongly fortified position of Bana=Heri, which was occupied by about 1500 men, with 500 of my troops, who fought with great bravura. Our losses in the three-hour battle amounted to 12 wounded, including 2 Caucasians. This probably means that the last pillar of the uprising in the north has been destroyed. Wißmann reports in his telegram of 15 January: "Pardoned rebels return in large numbers (The negotiations on the steamship bill in the Reichstag) on 17 January provided proof that the mood of the large majority of the Reichstag was still favorable to colonial policy. The frequently floated proposal to replace the direct Hamburg-Zanzibar line with a branch line from Aden was rejected in the same way by the speakers of the National Liberals, Conservatives and Reichspartel. Deputy Windtborst failed to deal with the bill in a dilatory manner and to transfer the task from the current Reichstag to the next one. The position of the Liberal Party, with the exception of Bamberger, on the bill can be seen from Virchow's statement, who warned against rushing the bill, but did not take a directly negative stance, insofar as the situation was in line with German interests. Mr. Bamberger tried to reinforce his assertion that this steamship line could never become profitable, that the money would simply be thrown into the water, by long explanations about the alleged failure of the lines to Samoa and Korea. Under all circumstances, the East African connection would not serve a national interest; at most, it would benefit the English, just like the East Asian line. State Secretary v. Stephan then gave a very detailed and convincing explanation of the proposal. In sharp contrast to the previous speaker, he gave a generally quite satisfactory picture of the results of the existing mail steamer lines, then described the development of our African colonies, their promising prospects, their importance for the great question of combating slavery and the civilization of the African part of the world, and described the planned steamer connection as the backbone, so to speak, for the fruitful pursuit of all these endeavours. Mr. Hobrecht spoke out in favour of the proposal from a broad perspective. Amid lively applause, he aptly described the unease and gloating with which the opponents of our colonial policy exploit every unfavorable piece of news about it. He very convincingly countered Bamberger's assertion that the Reich had embarked on warlike adventures in East Africa without any red flags. The empire was only doing what it was obliged to do for its citizens. No better protection and promotion of their economic and ethical aspirations in East Africa was conceivable than this mail steamer connection, which would prove to the Arabs that Germany was fully serious about maintaining its position there. Members v. Helldorff and Nobbe expressed a similar opinion. The fact that, in the opinion of the vast majority, this was a question that had been decided in the main, was already evident from the fact that the bill was not referred to a special commission for preliminary deliberation, but to the Budget Commission, which only had to examine the financial aspect. In the deliberations of the commission, in which the government was represented by State Secretary v. Stephan. Director of the Imperial Post Office Mr. Sachse and others took part on the part of the government, the proposal was then adopted with the amendments that the operators of the line should be obliged to call at a Belgian or Dutch port on the outward and return journey, and that the operators should be required to make greater payments or the subsidy sum of 900,000 marks per year should be reduced accordingly in the event of permanently higher profits. The third discussion of the bill took place on January 21, in which Professor v. Cuny rejected a criticism of the German Colonial Society's approach, which had been popular with Mr. Bamberger at the first reading. The bill was then finally adopted without further debate. (A new contract has been concluded between the Sultan of Sausibar and the German East African Society, according to which the calculation of the revenue to be paid to the Sultan as compensation for the assignment of customs duties is to be based on the average sum of the net customs duties of the previous, current and next year. The company receives 70,000 rupees annually as compensation for its expenses and waives its right to a share of the profits in the trial year. On the other hand, the Sultan gives it two valuable station houses in Dar es Salaam and lets it the customs office in Zanzibar with warehouses and officials' houses for fourteen years. In the circles of the German-East African Society one is apparently quite satisfied with these arrangements (From Witu.) The "Schwalbe" was, as several newspapers report, in Lamu on December 29; the customs collection of the Sultan Fumo Bakari has been stopped again, and the report that he has given up the Beledsoni Canal has been confirmed. (There is now news of the English Emin Pasha expedition of Mr. F. J. Jackson, an official of the British East African Company, who left with his expedition from Machakos Station in August for the north-eastern end of the Victoria Sea in order to open up this region to trade and possibly to support Stanley's expedition (see No. 2 of "Kolon.=Zig."). Swahili messengers have delivered letters from him, dated Sotik, 7th Okloder 1889. Sotik is situated at 35° east longitude and 0° 30' south latitude, within 12 days' journey of Biktoria=Nyanza. The caravan and its companions traveled for 12 days through a dense forest that is completely uninhabited. There is an abundance of ivory in Sotik and food is cheap. The natives displayed a very friendly demeanor. (Dr. Büttner.) Berlin N., Weinbergsweg 10, who intends to prepare a collection of Swahili letters written in Arabic letters for printing in order to provide our merchants, travellers and missionaries with a means of deciphering such letters and, if possible, to be able to answer them correctly, asks those who are in possession of such letters to send them to him for inspection or translation. (The Reichstag) on the 18th of this month, in its third deliberation, rejected both the Windthorst motion: to extend the provisions of the Congo Act, according to which the public practice of all cults should be permitted, to the Denish protectorates, and the Stöcker motion: rejecting the Windthorst motion, to call on the government to adopt a policy in which mutual competition between the Catholic and Protestant missions is avoided as far as possible. (Delagoabal Railway.) According to a telegram from the "Reuter schen Bureau" from Lorenzo=Marques dated January 24, the railroad which is intended to connect the Delagoa Bay with the Trausvaalland has been completed up to the border of the latter (via the Royal Niger Company), Major Mardonald, who, as is well known, was sent by the English government to investigate the complaint of the German government against the Royal Niger Company, has sent his

Report submitted to the Foreign Office. The "Times" reports that, although he does not agree with Mr. v. Puttkamer's statements on all points, he proposes substantial improvements in the administration of the Niger Company! The report will be published and we will then see what is in it. For the time being, the Times, albeit with a heavy heart, has already stated the need for improvements, which the Company, in its partisan rebuttal, declared to be superfluous. In the face of all these intrigues, we trust in the good right and statesmanship of Prince Bismarck, who should remind England at the given moment that it is not Portugal, but the German Empire, that is facing it. - (The text of the Samoa Treaty has been published. It declares the Samoa Islands to be neutral. The nationals of the signatory powers enjoy equal rights. The independence of Samoa is recognized. Furthermore, it is stated that none of the three signatory powers is entitled to exercise any special control. Malietoa is recognized as king and the formation of a supreme court is ordered, which is to consist of chief judges to be appointed by the three powers or, if they cannot agree, by the King of Sweden. The treaty also regulates property rights and restricts the right of the natives to sell land, makes provisions for the investigation of complaints, for the registration of valid land titles, determines the boundaries of the municipality of Apia and its administration, according to which the president of the municipal council is appointed by the three contracting powers. If no agreement can be reached on this, the King of Sweden or the King of Holland, Brazil or Switzerland shall be appointed as President. The treaty also contains a number of individual provisions on the levying of import duties and taxes, the sale of guns and spirits. The English and Americans are very pleased with the treaty. (Oriental Seminary in England.) Finally, England, which, in view of its extensive colonial possessions in the Orient, should reasonably have long provided the best means of learning Oriental languages, has also established a special school for this study, which was inaugurated by the Prince of Wales on January 11. The actual ceremonial address was delivered by our deserving compatriot, the Pros. Max Müller in Oxford, who also made a significant contribution to the establishment of the new institute. He also drew particular attention to the Seminar for Oriental Languages in Berlin and emphasized how not only the languages themselves are taught there, not only instruction is given in writing letters or drafting official documents or political treaties, but also the history and literature, the customs and traditions, laws and religions of the most important nations of the Orient are studied. It is, however, quite astonishing that such things have so far received so little attention in a nation that rules over a population in the Orient that is almost ten times as numerous as itself (Uber den Maté) writes Baron v. Maltzan from Villa San Pedro. Paraguay: "I completely agree with Dr. Kaerger about the effects and benefits of the use of maté, except for the request to conduct andau experiments with it in countries other than subtropical ones. On the world market, Paraguayan herda is the most expensive and most sought-after, and herdateros who have their perdales in Brazil are not afraid of the great expense and customs duties involved in bringing their herba across the Paraguayan border and re-porting it as Paraguayan herda. The verba forests begin about ¼4 days' journey from my estancia, but the temperature in the Paraquavian plerda forests drops so low at most that a light frost occurs on the coldest days and I hardly think they could bear 5 to 6 degrees of cold. However, I do not know the Drasilian conditions. The main difficulty is growing the Verba plants. In my garden I have a few large herbaceous trees which, brought here from the forest as small plants, are widely regarded as a rarity. They bear plenty of seeds, but here, as in many other places, attempts to create seedbeds and grow seed plants in the future have been in vain; some of them take off, but always give in again. This is not just my opinion, but has been confirmed to me many times. It would otherwise be a very profitable thing to plant an artificial perdal, as the trees, harvested every 5 to 6 years like an oak-peel forest, will grow again very well. Literature. The political division of Africa according to the latest international agreements (1888 to 1889). By Emile Banning, Director-General of the Royal Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Translated into German by Dr. Artbur Pfungst. Authorized edition with a map. Berlin 1890, published by Walther & Apolant. It is debatable whether it was necessary to translate a good work written in French with much effort in order to bring the events in Africa closer to the German reader, especially since events are moving so fast that a translator, when he has a work dealing with the latest history of Africa in progress, has to add appendix after appendix, so that in the end the additions grow quite disproportionately to the translated text. As a result, the book, which is otherwise well translated, is a little difficult to read, since the innocent reader is never quite sure whether the fact he has just memorized will not appear outdated by history a few pages later.
Stauley's Briefe über Emin Pascha's Be freinng, edited by Scott Keltie, Bibliotbekar de riglichen geographischen Gesellschaft zu London. Authorized German translation. Leipzig. F. A. Brockdaus. 1890. In anticipation of Stanley's travel work and the account by Emin Pasha himself, some readers will perhaps satisfy their curiosity about the journey with this collection of letters, all of which have already been published in English newspapers. Stauley's gripping style is well known; his art of description is excellent, so that the book has many highlights despite the often poor coherence of the letters. However, the fact that the book, which nevertheless bears a certain official stamp, also contains a false overview map of the return journey from Stanley, which goes via Tabora (which, as already noted in the previous issue of the "Kolonial=Zeitung", was left to the right of the caravan), is quite unfortunate, as it indicates a lack of care in the production and betrays the imprisonment of bookseller speculation.

Securing the German sphere of interest in East Africa. We have received the following letter from our readers, namely from Southern Germany: "The lively interest I have taken in our colonies from the beginning, the value of which I appreciate from previous trips to the Troughs, allows me to ask a question that is currently worrying us colonial friends here in the South and which you could perhaps kindly answer with a few words in the Kolonialzeitung Are the western borders of German East Africa up to the seas of Apasia, Tanganvika, etc. secure? s. s. s. secured After the highly disconcerting events on the Shire and Nyassa, it is to be feared that England, in ruthless pursuit of its plan to lay an English "backbono", an English trade route through the whole of Africa from the Cape to the Nile, could soon also appear on the already German-imagined eastern shore of the Nrassa and Tanganyika and find it desirable to have as wide a strip of land as possible, which would cut us off from the lakes. Tamit would essentially reduce our German East Africa to a plantation colony and the Central African trade, which now fertilizes our ports at Sanstbar, would be directed to English channels. For example, during negotiations against the slave trade, a French cardinal described the important Ujiji on the Tanganyika as naturally belonging to it, but after so many harsh experiences in colonial matters (Samoa, the Sultanate of Obbia, with almost the entire Somali coast of southwest Africa, which has become Italian, etc.), it would have been more difficult for the English to take it over. etc.), it would be highly desirable to forestall an English fait accompli (treaties with chiefs or the like) by a clear German ruling, if such a ruling does not already exist, of which we are not informed. Since our government itself has once declared that in colonial matters it must wait for the public voice of the nation and cannot proceed without it, it would perhaps be appropriate for the Kolonialzeitung to pose this, as it seems to us, burning question for discussion in the many German Kelenialvereine. Roch one question: Is the Auba River, which was first opened up by German pioneers and forms a waterway far into the country up to the mountains, already lost to us because, as it seems, Italy has laid its hands on the Somali coast lying in front of it, to which we would actually have had earlier claims The new German protectorate north of Witn unfortunately has no good connection to the Jnnern, and yet water connections to the Jnnern are vital issues for all tropical colonies. That is why England took the Niger and the Bennö, which was opened up by a German explorer, a few years ago, and is currently heading for the Zambezi; it already seems to regard the Tana, to which it is actually only entitled to the right user, as its waterway. It is wonderful how unanimously and energetically the entire English press has endorsed the violent pretensions against Portugal. We do not want any acts of violence against civilized peoples, but a nation which, like the Germans, is multiplying at an unimportant rate, may and must, as long as there is still time, lay its hands on countries where it can bring blessing through its culture. Where shall we send our labor products when the already unused number of our workers has doubled? That is why the colonial leader is instinctively in our people. Last year, when the British plan to establish themselves in the hinterland of the British East African possessions, which we mentioned several times, took on a firmer form through the formation of the British South African Company, which was to join hands with the British East African Company, we wrote the following in No. 23, after pointing out the urgency of border regulation in German Southwest Africa: "In East Africa, the border conditions are also still in great need of clarification. Although German territory has been secured to the north and south by agreements with England and Portugal, no indisputable border has yet been created to the west. We would particularly like to draw the attention of our colonial friends to this point, the majority of whom still seem to assume that German territory is secure as far as Tanganyika. Not only from the above omission in the Pall Mall Gazette, but also from earlier statements, it appears that certain English circles accept as the western boundary of East Africa a line drawn from the northernmost point of the demarcation line between the English and German spheres of interest, i.e. from Victoria Nyanza to the end point of the southern demarcation line at Nyassa, following about 35° east. If this border were recognized, the caravan trade to the east coast, to Zanzibar, would suffer enormously after a few years if the western Gediet came into English hands. The routes are still very busy today, but it is likely that the most important national products, ivory and rubber, would later flow southwards via the Nyassa. This would, of course, significantly impair the expected upswing of German East Africa and jeopardize its future. This subject has occupied us several times;*) we wrote in No. 24: "Since these English views have not remained hidden here, although they have not been given much weight, it will now be asked why steps have not been taken to avoid all complaints for the future and to firmly establish the border to the west. The same steps had, however, been taken earlier, at a time when it was generally assumed. Stanley had been instructed by the English government to place Emin Pasha under English protection and then to conclude treaties with the chiefs of the Jnner on the way back. The English government denied even then that Stanley had any such orders from it, and indicated that it had no intention of making acquisitions in the hinterland of the Dens' sphere of interest; but it is known that public opinion in England has often urged the government to take steps which it has refused to take for years. As a result of the English government's declaration, however, an expedition to Tanganpika that was possibly planned by the German East African Society was not sent. Today, no one will deny that the English missions are directly and indirectly preparing later English annexations, and that the English mission stations between our East African protectorate and Tanganyika could one day endanger our sphere of interest. This is also a view that can be found on a map in the Revue Française de l'Etranger et des Colonies*), which presents the conflict in East Africa, insofar as it affects us, as follows. The German protectorate on the coast between the Umbe River and the Rovuma is shown unchallenged as a German possession, but then a line is drawn from Ururi on the Victoria Nyanza southwards to the Nyassa, which, however, this sieve also No. 11 of the Kolonialzeitung 1889 *: No. 87 rom February 1, 1880.

Lake, but goes around the Livingstone Mountains on its frequent shore and then meets the boundary line agreed with the Portuguese only at some distance from Lake Ryassa. On the other hand, we would like to remind you that the border agreed with Portugal in the south is the course of the Rovuma River from its mouth to the point where the Msinje River flows into the Rovunna and from there continues westwards along the parallel to the shore of Lake Nyassa, so the map is completely wrong in this respect. However, this shore has a special significance for us because the only really protected and safe harbor on the eastern shore is located on the German side and because a usable waterway can possibly be established on the Rufiji and Ulanga, which leads to the vicinity of the falls on the upper reaches of the Rufiji into the vicinity of Lake Nyassa. Along this alleged western border of our territory, however, the following legend is inscribed on the map: "Border assigned to the Germans by the English missionaries! Between this imaginary border and Tanganyika, the following can also be read: "Zone of German claims" and "Possible conflict between Germans and English, as the latter are already in possession of the line of the Great Lakes through their missionaries". The extent to which the English are endeavoring to secure their influence in these areas can be seen from their current position towards the Arabs, who had blocked the Stevenson road leading from Nyassa to Tanganvika and had come into conflict with the African Lakes Company before the rebellion broke out on the coast. The attempts to capture the Arab fort at the northern end of the Nyassa failed, Captain Lugard had to return to Europe to recruit new crews, but due to the reluctance of the English, the high costs and the difficulties of transporting the war material to the upper Nyassa, the Arab fort was not captured. The English wisely supported the natives and are now once again masters of the all-important Stevenson Road, either because of this or, which is not unlikely, because they compared themselves with the Arabs. In the course of the previous year, as already mentioned. Capitan Trivier undertook a journey from the Congo through Africa. He had to turn back at Ujiji, reached the south bank of the Tanganyika, went to Niamkorlo, where he found English missionaries who had had to leave the island of Kavala near Ujiji before the Arabs, and reached Fwambo on August 19, where the London Missionary Society has a station.*) There he was warned not to leave his people unattended, as the whole country was at war with the Arabs and his Suahelis could easily be mistaken for Wangwana.*) On the 20th, ten people also escaped; his companion, Weißenburger, was later lost in the wilderness and probably perished. Trivier therefore wrote to the stations of Karonga asking for twenty armed men, some of whom were to serve as porters. With these he succeeded in reaching the Nyassa. It appears from this that the Stevenson Road is free again, which is highly gratifying in the interest of suppressing the slave trade, provided it is not really a rotten peace with the Arabs. Consul Johnston, whom Trivier met in Karonga on October 14, was then making preparations to advance into Tanganyika through the lands of Utschunga. Mambwe and Urunga, "with the undoubted intention of annexing these African provinces. It is high time, now that our affairs are at stake, that an open declaration of the Imperial Government's position was finally made, or that these matters, which are of great importance for the future of our East African possessions, were brought up in the Imperial Diet. At a recent dinner given by the Imperial Chancellor, His Majesty the Emperor is said to have expressed his great interest in German colonial policy and at the same time regretted that Germany could not devote as much resources to it as England. We hope that, despite this obstacle, ways and means may be found to make German colonization and cultivation in Africa as future-proof as England's has always been. Siebe Karte auf Seite 82. Jahrgang 1389 der D. Kol=Ztg. The term Wanzwana is used to refer to people who have spent a long time on the coast and have converted to Islam. According to Reichard, Mgwana originally meant only a free Negro born in Sanstbar, or a free man in general, or a man whose ancestors already belonged to the Jolam. The Wanjampara people are recruited from them. Captains, men of trust, who play an important role in the composition of the caravans.
How important the questions of demarcation are for our future on the east coast can also be seen from the following statements: The news brought by the "Times" that the Cast African Lake Company had reached a settlement with the Arabs in Karonga was, despite its importance for us, ignored by the entire German press. As friendly as our relations with England may be at the moment, it is nevertheless worthwhile, in view of England's attitude towards Portugal on the one hand and towards us on the other (I only recall the seizure of the Beledsoni Canal and the occupation of Manda and Patta), to realize what England has actually achieved by reaching an understanding with the Arabs in Karonga. Karonga, situated at the northern end of Lake Nyassa and for long stretches the only place on the coast with so few ports where cargoes could be unloaded, was chosen by the English as the starting point of the route to Lake Tanganyika when they decided to build this road, known as the Stewart and Stevenson Road. According to the reports of engineer Stewart, the difficulties of the construction seem to have been less technical than diplomatic. Every now and then there are reports of small or large rebel chiefs who want to prevent the road from being built and have to be put off with money and good words. Finally the road is finished and we read that one or the other Englishman has walked on it or stayed at a station for a while. But that is all and there was never any regular traffic from the company to Tanganyika. Only the Arabs used the road and brought ivory to Karonga, where the English bought it from them and transported it down the Nyassa, Shire and Sambest instead of letting it take the route via Tabora, Mpwapwa and Bagamoyo to Zanzibar as before. These conditions changed at the end of 1887 when some Arab slave hunters established themselves at the northern end of the lake and began to wreak havoc there. Conflicts with the agents of the Haudelsgesellschaft and the missionaries followed and the Arabs stopped bringing ivory to Karonga and even attacked the stations. Other excesses followed, one of the officials, who was also consul, had his clothes torn off, the English, who had made an attack on the Arabs' main entrenchment, were repulsed, the English trading company was then facing its downfall - and despite all this, on February 21 of last year, the Under-Secretary of State, Fergusson, who was beset with questions by the influential friends of those involved, declared in the English House of Commons that the government could not accept any responsibility with regard to the trading and mission stations on the Ryassa. What different strings have been pulled in London since then! Where a year ago it was nothing to strip and maltreat a consul, today the taking away of a few flags of the natives is almost a casus belli! All the English newspapers agree that England alone has the right to occupy the "backbone of Africa" stretching from the Kay to the mouth of the Nile, whether it lies behind Portuguese or German possessions. However, we have a treaty with Portugal which establishes a border from the Indian Ocean to Lake Nyassa and even secures us the Mbampa harbor, the best of the Nyasia. If, however, we look at the country to the south of the Rovuma River, which this treaty establishes as a boundary, we must confess that in the eyes of England the lands on the Rovuma belong much less to Portugal than those on the Zambezi and Nyassa, where at least for a time the Portuguese have maintained government officials. The whole area south of the Rovuma has only been traversed by English missionaries, never by Portuguese. However, there is nothing to be gained in this area, which has been devastated and depopulated by slave hunters and Magwangwara, except the possibility of sealing Germany off from Lake Nyassa, and doing so is a matter of life and death for the English Scengesellschaft. The latter could only exist as long as the Nyassa-Shire-Zambezi waterway (which was interrupted by 80 kilometers of very arduous land transport) was the only one leading to the coast. Although the Rusidji, which is now in our area, had been navigated by the engineer Beardall in a dhow as far as Korogoro, 150 kilometers from the coast, on behalf of Mr. Mackinnon in 1881, it was no longer an option after the expedition had to turn back due to the seemingly never-ending rapids and waterfalls. The Sambest = Shirer route was and remained the only practical road leading to the Nyassa and promised to become for the east what the Congo had become for the west. The crossing of the Ulanga (the southern part of the Congo) by Count Pfeil in 1836 was a major challenge.

It can hardly be doubted that, apart from money and good words, the events on the east coast played a major role in the conclusion of the settlement. The great caravan route from Tanganyika via Tabora and Mywaywa was blocked by unruben, and there would have been a great trade in ivory with the whites on the Nyassa if one had not been at war with them; likewise on the Tanganyika the European products, witness rc. News of Wissmann's victories reached the Ryassa, and rather than risk seeing the Germans come up the Rufidji or Rovuma, it was decided to make a settlement with the hated English. The Times does not tell us what the "terma" of this settlement are, nor whether it was concluded by the Arabs with a reservatio mentalis In any case, we Germans must not look on these events with indifference. England has never recognized Portugal's possession north of the Zambezi. Dr. Livingstone wrote about the Rovuma, our border agreed with Portugal, in 1862: The Rovuma is ouf of their (the Portuguese) claims and a free river, and based on this, he attempted to immediately sail up the Rovuma and reach the Nyassa, the customs places established by Portugal on the Zambezi. Only the fact that his steamer had a draught of over five feet and the voyage was taking place at the end of the dry season forced him to turn back and try again with the Zambezi, then recognized as Portuguese, after he had sailed 250 kilometers up the river and discovered hard coal on the way. When he came to Sanstbar in 1865, he again started his journey at the mouth of the Rovuma to avoid the hated Portuguese. But this time he is unable to enter the river; where three years earlier Lieutenant May, Livingstone's nautical companion, had measured a depth of three fathoms, the river is blocked by a very shallow bank and Livingstone decides to land in Mikindany Bay. He was followed by the missionary societies and established themselves on the "freo river", as Livingstone called the Rovuma (the stations Masasi and Newala are even 10 to 20 kilometers north of the river in our area), the missionary Bishop Steere and the missionary Johnson followed the Rovuma and its vine streams to the source. As late as last summer, the missionary bishop and German-hater Smythies passed through the country south of the Rovuma, as I was informed by reliable sources in Sanstbar; but Portugal has not done anything to establish its rule there, with the exception of the attack on Tunghi). We thus see that Portugal's claims to the land on the Rovuma stand on much shakier foundations than on the Zambezi, where Portuguese officials have been active for centuries, and that England may therefore any day succeed in wanting to annex us from the co-ownership of the Nyassa and Rovuma Let us hope that it may at least be possible here to set a limit to the claims of the English before it is too late! A. W. Schleicher. *) We do not share the view that Portugal has not exercised any sovereign rights in the territories east of Nyassa to the Indian Ocean. Portugal did in fact have long residents among the Medo and Mucaribo and as late as 1885 flew its flag in Medo and Mewalia. For centuries, the tribal chiefs of the Makuas came to Quelimane to ask for confirmation from the Portuguese governor, and even today the caravans of Luiz Gonzago from Jdo constantly pass through the country between the Nyassa and the coast, which was also crossed by Agosto Cardojo from Jho in 1885-86. It would be very desirable if our cartographers also wanted to help the Portuguese explorers to their right. However, it is more convenient to enter the itinerary of an English consul, which is given in one of the widespread English geographical journals, than to collect the rather hidden Portuguese material.

The accommodation of freed slaves." A. History. In 1817, the British Parliament made the following orders with regard to the slaves freed by warships (State l'apers 1817 p. 847 ff.): they shall be forfeited to the Crown for its sole use, with the simultaneous extinguishment of all claims made on them by other parties. Certain civil and military officials are authorized and obliged to care for the freedmen and either to enlist them in the army or navy or to hire them out to private individuals as "apprentices" for a maximum period of 14 years, regardless of whether they are of age or not. Every contract of apprenticeship concluded in due form by the authority concerned shall have the same force as if the ex-slave had concluded it himself: likewise, the person enlisted in the army or navy shall be regarded and treated in every respect as if he had entered voluntarily. The officials entrusted with these measures on the West African coast - it was the governor of Sierra Leone - had to send in annual reports on their activities with precise details of the behavior and progress of those accommodated, as well as of the persons with whom they had been "apprenticed". A supplementary act of June 24, 1824 (State Papers 1823-24 p. 656 ff.) stipulated that the term of apprenticeship for freed slaves was to be reduced to a maximum of 7 years, and that if the apprentice was treated badly by his principal or his principal's representative, he could file a complaint with the nearest competent authority. The authority must investigate the matter and, if the principal is proven guilty, sentence him to a fine of up to 100 Lstrl. and possibly also cancel the apprenticeship contract. At the same time, England concluded treaties with other states concerning the slaves freed by English cruisers in the vicinity of their territory (ibid. p. 696 ff., 698, 709 ff. 718 ff.): these are also incorporated into the land or sea power of the state concerned or handed over to private individuals as apprentices, and special officials are charged with checking from time to time on the behavior of those accommodated and their treatment. (cf. Blaub. 1842 Slave Trade vol. 44, 1849 p. 145 f., p. 139 ff). All these provisions are particularly interesting insofar as they show how little fear England showed in the use of freed slaves and how unhesitatingly it applied decisive coercion. Incidentally, since the vast majority of the liberations and thus also of the placements were distributed along the West African coast, at least something was gained for the colonization of Africa: workers and troops were obtained. The English troops garrisoned in Sierra Leone were mostly freed slaves; their zeal and obedience is praised (Alexander, Excursions in West Africa 1 p. 105). However, when the fatal consequences of emancipation began to make themselves felt in the West Indies towards the end of the 1930s, with plantation operations almost everywhere in the most precarious situation due to the departure of the finally freed slaves, the freedmen on the West African coast were brought in large numbers to the West Indian colonies and put into service as "free Ardites" with plantation owners; the same was later done in Natal, Mauritius and the Seychelles. (Blaub. 1859 Colon. Sess. 1I vol. XXI). As understandable as it may seem that England took this course in order to get out of great economic difficulties, the reputation of all efforts directed against the slave trade and slavery must have been severely damaged by this. For the colonization of Africa, which Buxton had already pointed out as the most effective way of fighting the slave trade, was in no way promoted by this, and whether it was advantageous for the education of the blacks that they were torn away from their continent and placed in a foreign country, in foreign conditions, can justifiably be doubted. After their arrival in the West Indies, they had to hire themselves out to plantation owners by contract for at least 3 years (see Blaub. op. cit. no. 102). The English government adopted a different accommodation procedure, which incidentally is of dubious value for the education of blacks, for some of the slaves freed each year on the East African coast, namely those who had already been on the islands for a longer period of time *) Abridged reprint of a memorandum written on behalf of Commission V of the German Colonial Society.

Zanzibar and Pemba or on the coast and were sufficiently proficient in Swahili, but also appeared intelligent enough to take care of themselves and their freedom, were assigned to the "Society of Freed Slaves" in Zanzibar after their freedom papers had been issued. (S. Blaub. 1886. Slavo-Trade No. 104 p. 137. While all the types of accommodation discussed so far could only be of very limited value for the colonization of Africa and thus also for the suppression of the slave trade, one could expect far greater success in this respect from settlements of freed slaves on African soil. The fact that this hope was only fulfilled to a very limited extent was mainly due to the faulty procedure adopted by the British government. First of all, it was a serious mistake to favor Sierra Leone, which had passed from the hands of a private company to the Crown in 1808, as a settlement point. If a constant supervision by white people is a sine qua non for the success of such an enterprise and a frequent change of personnel in this management entails great dangers, then hardly a more unfavorable region could be found than Sierra Leone, whose climate is not even particularly conducive to the blacks, but is absolutely pernicious for the whites: of 89 missionaries who had come there between 1804 and 1825, only 14 remained in 1825; 54 had died, 14 were ill and only 7 had returned home in good health. (Alexander, Excursions in West-Africa. 2nd ed. 1840. l. p. 117, 97.) It is also recognized that the frequent change in the Gonverneurs' personnel was a great obstacle to the development of the colony But in another respect, Sierra Leone was not the right soil for the settlement of freed slaves: the population into which they were placed here was a conglomerate made up of the most precarious components. The first colonists, settled in 1787, were about 400 blacks who had idly roamed the streets of London, as well as a number of whites, mostly debauched women. This company, soon thinned out by debauchery during the voyage, violent fevers after arrival and fights with the natives, was supplemented in 1792 by about 1800 blacks from Nova Scotia and 100 whites, company officials, salaried craftsmen, soldiers and colonists. Heavy downpours, lack of food and sufficient shelter cause a tenth of the Nova Scotians and half of the whites to succumb to fever. It is very indicative of the character of the Nova Scotians that although they were highly dissatisfied with the Company, which was initially only able to grant them 4 acres of land (for each family) instead of the promised 40, they regarded farming as a slavish, degrading occupation. A small rent placed on their farms caused them to rebel in 1800. To suppress this, 530 maroons were imported from Jamaica, a boisterous rabble completely averse to agriculture. (Cf. Account of the Colopy of Si-rra Leono 1795. Sprengel, Gesch. der Kolonie S.=L.; Burton-Cameron, To the Goldcoast for Gold 1883 II p. 3 ff.; Church. Mi-s. Iotellig. 1881 p. 720 fl.; Buxton, der afrik. Sklavenhandel 1841 p. 273 This was the population into which England had been planting freed slaves since 1808. Perhaps it could have gradually overcome the evil influence of the old colonists by a doubly prudent and practical approach to the accommodation of the freedmen. The Company had made quite commendable beginnings in the education of the blacks: it had sought to increase agricultural zeal through premiums, established an experimental garden and a model farm, and ordered the payment of certain taxes. (Sprengel op. cit. Burton p. 4 f.) But unfortunately the ara of the Crown Regiment does not indicate any progress in this respect. A report from 1834 provides a vivid picture of the procedure observed at the time of settlement (Alexander op. cit. p. 96; cf. Howett, Europ. Settlements on the West Coast of Africa 1862 p. 105). Once a slave ship had been captured, its cargo was deposited in the "slave yard" of Freetown, a walled enclosure consisting of several sheds. This was the freed slaves' place of residence for the first three months; they were maintained here entirely from state funds (cf. State Papers 1817-18 p. 578 No. 8). However, the men had to do day labor in and near Frectown. While many of the freed children *) The first official report on this was only given considerably later: Siate papera 1821-23, p. 163, 139 fl.
were taken on as apprentices or house servants by white or colored inhabitants, the men were now assigned their land shares, but were fed by the authorities for a further three months and provided with equipment worth over 1 pound sterling. Thus, especially on the north coast of Sierra Leone, numerous government villages were established, each under the supervision of state officials, some of them former missionaries, others old naval paymasters, who received an annual salary of 150-200 pounds sterling. However, no consideration was demanded of the blacks, who were so liberally endowed, and they were even given a completely free hand in the cultivation of their land. Blacks who were skilled craftsmen were chosen as police servants for the individual villages of the regency in order to instruct the people in all kinds of mechanical skills - but there was a distinct lack of sustained agricultural instruction. Thus the freed Africans tried ginger cultivation without any prior knowledge or instruction and naturally fell into it (Buxton op. cit. p. 280; Blaub. 1830 No. 57; Burton-Cameron II p. 9 f., 36 f). There were indeed governors who set themselves the task of healing this sore spot of Sierra Leone and tried to set up an apprenticeship period of several years for the settled blacks, but reluctance, abortion or death always shortened their term of office (Burton Cameron II p. 12 Sierra Leone Weckly Times XXX 1862). It is almost incredible, but a fact, that there were no regulations at all for the settlement of freed slaves, to which every governor would have been bound. In the administration of the colony - as a high official there wrote to Buxton (p. 271 ff) - the greatest lack of planning prevailed. Nothing was done systematically, with the exception of the administration of justice. Instructions from home were not received, each governor was left entirely to the promptings of his own mind as to the employment and treatment of the liberated Africans, and scarcely two successive governors have used one and the same method in this respect. Moreover, most of them were past middle age when they took up their positions, old officers without sufficient knowledge of the difficult conditions that prevailed here, and not equal to the masses of work that arose no less from the accommodation business than from the administration in general (Alexander 102. 112; Hewett 293 But these grievances were only of secondary importance: the basic evil was that the settled blacks were given all the privileges of English citizens without further ado and not only were they not given an apprenticeship in agriculture, but they were not even required to pay regular taxes. To this day, Sierra Leone has neither direct taxes nor housing taxes; the entire revenue of the colony comes from customs duties and incomprehensibly high harbor taxes. (Burton 11 p. 27 ff.) It is therefore not at all surprising that the black man, with his great lack of need - in the best case only produced, or rather had his wife produce, as much as his body's raw needs absolutely demanded (Hewett p. 151 f, Burton p 36 f); very often, however, he shied away from this very minimal, honest work and preferred to establish himself in the city as a peddler or petty trader, of which Freetown is teeming: in 1883, 23 percent of the population of the entire Sierra Leone peninsula was made up of them. (Burton p. 38 ff.; Church. Mi-s. Intell. 1881 p. 720 ff.; Colonies and India, a weckly newspaper. London Dec. 17, 1881.) In spite of the excellent soil, nothing had been harvested in 1834 in sufficient quantity for export, and today the situation is by no means better: Sierra Leone ekes out its miserable existence on the basis of the sources of aid which flow to it from the neighboring countries of the interior (Alexander p. 95; Church. Miss. Intell. op. cit.) The information given here is merely drawn from English reports of various kinds, both private and official, and from various years: there can therefore be no doubt as to its accuracy. Burton, a keen observer and not prejudiced that the education of the blacks belongs to the realm of dreams, summarizes his judgment on the proceedings of the English government as follows: (p. 10): "In marvelous obtuseness and want of common sense, our government has made Englishmen of these blacks without distinction, with the capacity of sitting in judgment, holding office, and exercising all the precious rights of an Englishman. Instead of their being apprenticed or compelled to labor under supervision for about seven years, instead of being taught to till and plant the land, as would certainly have been done with whites in a similar situation, they have been allowed to

to idle, lie, and cheat all their lives, harmful to themselves as to others, a "Labor Laws," Sierra Leone Resident Reporter (S. L. Weekly eXXX 1862) "may be out of place in England, but in Sierra Leone they would have saved a whole population from trusting to the lure of a petty demoralizing trade; they would have spared us the sight of ruined villages and a people daily becoming more unfit to do the arduous work of agriculture. To handle the hoe has now become a disgrace, and the men have lost their manliness by becoming "gentlemen". It should also be added that the mission in Sierra Leone has brought little real blessing. If individual travelers praise the Basel Missionary Society for having trained the youth in various trades (Burton II p. 23; more recently Henrici, Staatsbürgerzeitung 188. No. 201), this praise is likely to find only very limited approval. There is no doubt that far too much good has been done in this respect. The lack of small craftsmen - above all the tailoring trade is notoriously one of the worst grievances of the colony: it owes its origin, however, to the activities of the Basel Mission and related endeavors of the English government (Burton II p. 38; Church Miss. Int. op. cit.). The history of Sierra Leone does not present a pleasing picture - the attempt to create a colony of freed slaves that would be self-sustaining and contribute to the subjugation of the black continent to European culture was by no means successful. But it is in every respect extraordinarily instructive for all future undertakings of the same kind and, moreover, not discouraging For the poor success was due far less to the nature of the matter - the difficulty of which no one will fail to recognize - than to a series of obvious blunders, almost all of which can be traced back to the basic error of an inverted humanity: only this could tempt one to simply give the blacks a present. Only from this point of view can one understand the blindness with which the blacks were unquestioningly granted English citizenship, which presupposes a high level of culture and conditions quite different from those of the Africans. With the promising soil, the climate, which was absolutely pernicious for the white man, was accepted, and the favorable location by the sea, which made exports very convenient, made people forget the great danger that this very location held for the development of the black man. He naturally became a miserable little trader instead of a good producer - his inclination to trade is known to be very great. And it is the latter that we should be concerned with in his education, insofar as it is of an economic nature. England has not created a second settlement of freed slaves on the large scale of Sierra Leone. But since the treaty with the Sultan of Zanzibar in 1872, when the British navy was given the power to detain all ships suspected of exporting slaves on the Zanzibar coast and search them for slaves, the same enterprise has been resumed, on a small scale and with certain modifications. A significant fraction of the slaves freed each year were transferred to the most important missionary societies working on the east coast: the English Church Mission, the English University Mission and the French Catholic Mission of Bagamoyo. The difference between them was that the Church Mission took in adults as well as children, while the other two only took in children, the Catholic Mission in any number, the University Mission to a limited extent, depending on the space available. (Blaub. 1886 No. 104 p. 137.) It is also worth mentioning that the Catholic mission, which evidently had considerable resources at its disposal from the outset, received no remuneration for the slave children it accommodated: it itself often purchased young slaves. However, from July 1, 1884, the two English societies received the sum of 5 pounds sterling for each person transferred to them because of the costs involved in educating and training the blacks. This amounted to an expenditure of 2575 pounds sterling for the years 1881-1887. A large number of freed slaves from the church mission stations were sent to Mombas. The boys are taught agriculture or carpentry, blacksmithing, baking and tailoring; the girls are taught sewing and cooking. The adults are used for house and road construction. (Blaub. 1878 No. 227 Incl 2.) While we hear nothing here about the agricultural activities of the adults, we are better informed in this respect about the second station of the church mission, Freretown. The freed slaves there were allocated small estates and supplied with the materials needed to build houses. They devoted their labor to the lands of the mission for daily wages, the men for 6 pence, the women for 4 pence. Cburch. Miss. Intell. 1885 p. 160, 376.) After some time the majority were encouraged to settle outside the station on land allotted to them and to cultivate it independently: thus the settlement of Mawani, 3 miles from Freretown, was established, where some of the freed slaves had 1-2 acres under cultivation in 1881. (Ibid. 1881 p. 35.) The third station of the church mission in this area, Nabai, was also assigned freed slaves: however, its population consisted mainly of fugitive slaves from the neighborhood; also, in 1885, 1000 free Wanikas had already settled around the station. The admission of fugitive slaves caused such acrimony among the former owners that the existence of the station was highly endangered and had to be secured by paying 25 pounds sterling compensation for each slave. Incidentally, it is very characteristic of the importance attached to these settlements in England that it was not the mission but the British East African Company that paid this compensation. (Ibid. 1881 p. 34; 1884 p. 242 ; 1889 p. 50; Procccdings of the Church. Miss. Society 1885-86 p. 38 f; Blaub. 1881 Slav. Trade No. 242. The missionary reports praise the freed slaves as diligent and energetic workers. (Intell. 1881 p. 38.) However, their education seems to have been carried out with the same false humanity that was the undoing of Sierra Leone: Johnston, who had taken members of the Rabai station with him as porters on his ascent of Kilimanjaro, found them extremely unruly; they refer to their missionaries, to whom they would report it if Johnston beat them. "A worse gang of people than these Rabai porters," Johnston explains, "I have seldom met in Africa." (Kilimanjaro p. 107, 121.) We also read in the Blue Book of 1885 (Slav. Trade No. 122) that the freedmen in Freretown occasionally engaged in clandestine slave trading themselves. Very little is known about the procedure of the university mission. Initially, it had also taken in adults and formed a large farm of 130 acres from them in Moweni, near the city of Zanzibar. (News from the East African Mission 1887 p. 102 f.; Ant. Slav. Rep. 1885 p. 267.) Encouraged by the success of a settlement on the Shire formed in 1864 from Livingstone's old servants and freed slaves, which in a short time gained leadership over the surrounding tribes and a strong influence on the Shire=Zambesi=traffic (Aot. Slav. Rep. 1887 p. 61; Waller, Pathe into the Slave-Preserves of East Africa), the university mission under the leadership of Bishop Steere sent 55 freed and educated slaves to Massasi, on the road from Lindi to Lake Nyassa, in order to establish a settlement there, which in time was to become a complete work against the slave trade on this road. The settlement initially developed quite favorably, but later fell victim to destruction by predatory tribes from the surrounding area. (Blaub. 1878 Slav. Trado No. 236; 1886 No. 104 p. 137. The Catholic mission of Bagamoyo not only took over children who had been freed by the English authorities, but also bought them from slave traders and owners. The natives also frequently brought their own children to sell. In terms of education, the principle was observed here that the children should only be moderately occupied with learning, but more with field work and handicrafts, and efforts were made to take individual talents into account as far as possible when choosing the activity assigned to each child. In the course of a few years and without any help other than that of its pupils, the mission succeeded in cultivating around 50 hectares of land (Schneider, Die katholische Mission in Sansibar. Regensburg 1877). A report from 1880 gives the following description of the station (Die katholischen Missionen, Ill. Mon.=Schrift 1881 p. 44 ff., 1882 p. 174): "The Christian village belonging to the mission consists of about 70 families .... They work on the mission's estates five days a week and receive their wages on Sundays in the form of fruit and salted fish. Each family has its own small plot of land, on the sole condition that it actually cultivates it. They can dispose of the fruit they harvest as they see fit .... Whoever neglects his field out of laziness will be punished by having it taken from him and given to the industrious. One of the Negroes ... is appointed mayor of the village. He has to stand up for good order and inform the Father of any disturbance. He holds roll call in the evening. We can pretty much do all the blacksmithing and carpentry work ourselves. If you can get these people the iron and the wood

as well as in Europe, you would hardly believe that these are slaves from the innermost part of the wildest part of the world, etc." - This report was written by a missionary there, but its content is confirmed by other, completely objective reports. The activities of these missionaries, who, as is well known, were mainly recruited from Alsace and Rhineland, were indeed crowned with success with regard to the great problem that Africa posed to the colonizing rations: the education of the natives for work. As early as 1873, the British authorities in Zanzibar described Bagamoyo "as a true model institution for colonizing Africa," and in one of his letters (Reisebriefe und Berichte 1888, p. 427), Emin Pasha recommends the establishment of mission stations similar to these Catholic ones, albeit with the characteristic Emin addition: "perhaps with a little less religious ballast and less psalm-singing." In fact, less was probably done in this respect in Bagamoyo than in the English mission stations. As the above report shows, the working conditions were those of a plantation economy: almost all of the blacks' labor was devoted to the mission's land, which in turn provided a small plot of land with housing and a weekly food allowance. It would be premature to draw general practical conclusions from the success of this experiment. Most of these blacks had been under the educational influence of the mission from an early age; it is doubtful whether the same procedure could be carried out just as successfully with adults. The strong inclination of Africans to independent economic activity is a fact that we must reckon with: it is only a matter of finding the right limits. Incidentally, what is remarkable about this station is that, with decisive luck, a capable member of black society has been given the dignity of headman and the responsibility for peace and order. This is reminiscent of another model station on African soil where a similar principle - with regard to the police - has been implemented quite systematically: Botschabelo in Tranovaal. Dr. Friedrich Back. (Conclusion follows.) On defense. From the Deutsche Siedelungs=Gesellschaft Herman we receive the following: Berlin, February 11, 1890. The "Post" brought in its No. 36 of 6. d. M. an article entitled "On the question of emigration to Brazil", which also discusses our Brazilian company, but does so in such a malicious manner, which completely contradicts the facts, that our reputation and aspirations must be severely damaged by this and we are therefore forced to correct the facts in order to prevent this unjustified damage to our interests, however little we are inclined to pay attention to openly defamatory writings. The article in question, which lacks the necessary objectivity throughout, is not based on the author's own observations, but on reports by others; shows extraordinarily little expertise, as it uncritically lumps together things that should be kept and judged quite separately, the climatically, healthwise and economically fundamentally different conditions of tropical Brazil and subtropical southern Brazil, as well as the emigration of dispossessed and therefore less resistant wage laborers and independent landowners, and thus arrives at false judgments from false foundations, and is therefore not at all in a position to refute the opinion of the great majority of all discerning and objectively judging experts on Brazil that southern Brazil "is a splendid area for colonization". We will therefore confine ourselves to correcting the facts mentioned in the Post article that concern us. The article says about our company: "There are also unfavourable rumours circulating about German colonization ventures there. The land purchased for the German colonization company "Herman" is said to be in a desolate state and the company is already being portrayed in public newspapers as completely hopeless. Apart from a few oases, the soil is among the worst to be found in the province. No colonist already established in Vrasilia and familiar with the conditions would buy there because he would run the risk of losing his money and his work. So many "rumors", so many unfounded untruths. The Bom Retiro settlement near Porto Alegre in Rio Graude do Sul, which we had acquired, was found to be highly recommendable for the settlement of Germans by two German farmers who were sent to Brazil as representatives of a group of German farmers wishing to emigrate in order to select suitable land for sale for their settlement, before our company came into being and thought about acquiring it. The reports of both gentlemen were published in the "Deutsche Kolonialzeitung") at the time. Our own representative fully agreed with the judgment of these two men. We therefore bought Bom Retiro only after it had been established by reliable investigations that it had good soil and was excellently situated for settlement; we are therefore entitled to declare mere rumors to the contrary to be completely incorrect and to consider them to be the outrages of envious and malicious competitors in the sale of land. On the basis of the reports of our German administrator of Bom Retiro, Mr. Soyaux, and the shareholders of our company living over there, who are fully informed about our settlement, we consider Bon Retiro and its equivalent surroundings to be so useful and recommendable for the settlement of German independent farmers that we intend to acquire neighbouring settlements in order to expand our company Bom Retiro. No better substantiated is the assertion that our enterprise is regarded as completely hopeless and that no colonist familiar with the circumstances would buy land in our settlement. The fact is that shortly before the coup d'état of November 15 of last year, the provincial parliament of Rio Grande do Sul granted us an annual subsidy of 10 Contos de Reis (approx. 23,000 M) for the maintenance and promotion of our experimental economy in Bom Retiro. However, such a subsidy is not granted to an enterprise that is regarded as completely hopeless. This important fact undoubtedly has much more significance for the assessment of our company dock, than the judgment of some anonymous reporter who perhaps deserves very little credence. Incidentally, we are not aware of any such judgment in Brazilian newspapers, even though we read them avidly. It is also a fact that a paper factory corporation has bought land in our settlement and is building its factory on it, because the fertility of our land guarantees a plentiful supply of the necessary manufacturing material, and that some colonists who are well acquainted with the situation are in negotiations with the administrator of Bom Retiro about acquiring land there. Only people who want to cultivate without fertilization, who want to cultivate permanently, as is customary in the forest settlements, can judge the soil of our settlement disparagingly; but these people would judge even the best soil in Germany disparagingly. Our society is founded and endeavors with zeal, but also with all due caution in its undertakings, to contribute as far as possible to ensuring that the highly important German emigration, which is to be regarded as unavoidable, is organized in the national and economic interests of Germany. We therefore believe that we are fully entitled to the active support of our enterprise, or at least to sympathy for our endeavors and activities from every German, and may therefore describe it as saddening that a German, as it seems, only out of exuberant, blind hatred against the German progressives and their Teutobrazilian comrades in spirit, who are only to be found in isolated cases, is more hostile to us than is usually the case with these very progressives, and thus harms an enterprise that is intended to serve a highly important German interest, the expedient organization of German emigration, and is making every effort to do so. Herman, German Settlement Society. Kurella. James' journey into the interior of Somaliland. By L. Hirsch. With map. (Conclusion.) The people of Gerhadfi, in whose territory the caravan was now encamped, showed themselves friendly and brought cows and sheep as gifts, the value of which was naturally returned. Sultan And honored the travelers with his visit and was greeted with a volley of blanks, as befitted a sovereign of his rank. Conversation with him got off to a difficult start as Aud observed a sullen silence. James's people declared Aud to be an ufurpator who had killed Deria, allegedly Sultan of all Habr Gerhadzis, and taken over part of his *) See Deutsche Kolonialzeitung, volume 1886, issue 17.

The sultan claimed that he had usurped an illegitimate territory which he now had to defend against Nar, the brother of the slain man. In fact, incessant fighting took place between the two sultans, and their border areas were the daily scene of plundering, robbery and murder. On December 29, the caravan set off again and the ascent was accomplished, albeit with unspeakable hardship for the camels. The travelers were forced to provide themselves with more camels, cattle and water vessels for the tour through the waterless hand, all of which Sulkan Aud promised to provide for them in his main settlement of Burao, a Bulhar they called Bur=o, which they referred to as the well of Habr Annis. They set out on their march there in his company and reached it in five short days' march. On the way, they passed the ruins of a large city on the first day, which Menges also mentions, attributing it, like James, to Gallas without further explanation. The first night was spent fighting at Guldeo Hammed; the air was pleasantly cool, the dew heavy. But the travelers were not happy to rest, for the glow of a fire made them fear for their safety. Fortunately, there were no hostilities against the caravan: the Esa Musa had only attacked another tribe, plundered its cerides and set fire to them. In Bur=o, the caravan camped on the left bank of the Tua=Der, which is 50 yards wide here, but only carries water in the rainy season; meanwhile, more than twenty wells dug into the wadi to a depth of 60 feet provide an ample water supply at all times. The stay in Bur=o dragged on, as the Sultan was unable to fulfill his promises as quickly as the travellers would have liked. In the meantime, they had to enjoy numerous visitors, and their ceremony was initially the destination of all those who wished to consult the doctor - heumatism and scabies were the most common diseases, and wounds of all kinds, old and new, were also presented. Particularly "interesting cases" were presented by two patients who had been seized by lions in their sleep, released again as a result of their screaming, and whose shattered shoulders had healed but become completely stiff. However, Mother Nature had already done enough here and the white Hakim could only acknowledge this with respect. As great European rulers are wont to do, Sultan Aud honored his guests with magnificent displays. A fantasy of 200 warriors on beautifully decorated horses, a parade of ostriches and war dances by the Midgan provided interesting entertainment; however, the harmless amusement was soon disturbed by a blessing that one would have least expected. A message arrived from Major Hunter that he had received telegraphic instructions from the English representative in Cairo to hold back the expedition, which, however, was no longer possible. He therefore urged the travelers to return, and it was a grave decision for them when, once outside the reach of English power, they decided to pursue their goal steadfastly. Nevertheless, the change in Mr. Hunter's views gave them a great deal of credit, as he had furthered their purposes in every way in Aden. It turned out later that he had telegraphed to England that he considered the venture dangerous, presumably to cover his back in case of any danger. The worst thing, however, was that the messengers were aware of the state of affairs, and that they had apparently even been given hints to facilitate the expedition's return by inciting the people. And they not only tried to do this here, but also, as became apparent in the course of the journey, spread a hostile atmosphere against the caravan all the way to the Ogaden. It was a double-edged sword that was handed to the Somalis, and one should not have been surprised if they had drawn the final conclusions from the situation as they saw fit. The difficulties and misgivings arising from these events were happily overcome, and an earlier letter from Hunter, in which he had called on all the Somali sultans and chiefs to lend their support to the expedition, played a major part in restoring the confidence that had been shaken. They succeeded in driving 35 camels to the border of the Ogaden; there was no definite idea about the distance of the wells and it was said that no caravans at all were used to traveling to the Ogaden in the dry season. On January 9, they set out again, now with 100 men and women. 103 pack and 10 slaughter camels, 8 plerds and a number of sheep and oxen. The sultan provided three abbans, people whose daughters were married to men from the Baha=Wadlv, a neighboring Ogaden tribe. He himself accompanied the expedition for another day, after which he took his leave, having been issued with a certificate recommending him to anyone who might ever find themselves in the position of having use for a sultan. From here on, the spectre of water shortages accompanied the travelers. They make long marches to overcome the waterless area as quickly as possible. On the first day, they pass a plain over seven kilometers long, which served as grazing ground for several thousand camels. Then the ground turns red instead of brown, the vegetation thicker and thornier; most of the haud resembles a parched "African cake garden instead of an English one." They notice beisa= and other antelopes, also hyenas, and hear the cry of the jackal, and it seems almost astonishing to them that animal life should live there. The camels have to work their way through the thorns, thorns in every conceivable shape, as sharp as fishhooks. Some of the hantas (wooden water vessels) are lost, partly through the carelessness of the people, partly because the camels run into the trees with them. After five days, the camels brought by Aden become weak and have to be watered; the Sultan's camels run back. The ground becomes redder; the red dust settles on the travelers, who can no longer wash themselves and look hideous. Supposedly they are already in the Ogaden, but this region is only inhabited in the rainy season.

Eight days of trovic heat have passed, there is barely enough water for two days, and nobody knows where the wells are. A misty lake, fringed with green trees, appears in the distance: - it is a mirage. The area becomes more desolate than ever. They are a day away from the Hodayn Basins and James sends people ahead to see if there is any water. There was no water, of course, but a blackish, almost liquid mud. Twenty wells were dug in an hour, holes in which a dark liquid gradually rose to a height of one foot. When a hole was exhausted, a new one was drilled and the hantas filled. There were some quolqnois in the area and fairly green thorn trees with plenty of game, even elephant tracks. A particularly strong Zeriba was erected here because of the Dul Bahanti, which the caravans used to linger at this spot. Now another four days to Gerloguby. The vegetation became somewhat more abundant and the caravan passed fresh green pastures several times. On the way they once again managed to get some water for the horses by digging. Two days from Gerloguby, the soil began to change from dark red earth to light red sand, followed by limestone. Soon the travelers looked down onto a plateau covered with scree and bordered by a dense forest of thorns. On this plateau are the wells, 70-80 feet deep, drilled through the massive feis; this was Gerlogubv. the longed-for. People and animals could rest here. The Somali camels had not received a drop of water since Bur-o, 13 days ago. On the plateau, numerous natives were busy watering their herds. The appearance of the whites was obviously unexpected and caused a great deal of concern, but at first there was no hostile mood towards them. The travelers, however, secured themselves in any case by fortifying their Zeribe as strongly as possible and providing it with a special thorn cover. The armed herdsmen, from whom they thought they could buy oxen and sheep, gave nothing, but declared that they would await the arrival of the chiefs for the time being. This was delayed for six days, after which a gift of two cows and a camel arrived. The tribes with whom they had to come to an agreement were the Rär Dollol and Ugaß Elmi, both strong subdivisions of the Baha Wadly. The consultation of the chiefs about the amount of tribute to be collected led to a demand of 4000 deaths (robes, each 7-8 bards of cotton cloth), which had to be rejected for obvious reasons and excluded any counter-bid. It has not been made quite clear by James whether the tribes mentioned really intended to attack the caravan. In any case, they demonstrated in large houses in the face of the Zeriba of the English, who were thus put in an embarrassing tension and put themselves in a defensive state. In order to shorten the period of uncertainty and at the same time to ascertain the effect of the European weapons on the invaders, James organized a kind of counter-demonstration by having his men fire their guns in volleys into the air. The success exceeds expectations: most of the troublesome troublemakers flee as far as possible, others fall on their faces in fright, calling out to Allad. Those who return keep a safe distance, and towards evening the Ugaf Elmi and Dollol retreat to their settlements. Numerous guards are posted for the night, but the rube of the camp remains unbroken. James considers the successes he achieved here and on other occasions to be mainly the result of caution coupled with determination, and attributes the useless sacrifice of many precious lives to the lack of the latter trait in particular. He quotes Lord Aberdeen's statement regarding "the bostile disposition and uncertain temper of the Somali tribes baving hitberto offored an invincibio obstacle to the exploration of their country by tho Europeans", which must necessarily be underestimated. Anyone who has lived among the Somalis for any length of time knows that they cannot be relied upon. It must be all the more disconcerting when we find the undoubtedly difficult character of this people portrayed in rosy colors in some recent German reports, while we must be interested in truthful information about them. After the events mentioned above, a friendly relationship with the natives was soon established. A bale of goods was given for general distribution, while the most respected chiefs received a number of better items and some pieces of silk cloth. The valuable affection of the priests was also purchased by gifts, of which copies of the Koran were most highly prized. Now the shepherds brought sheep and camels for sale and exchange, patients wanted to be cured. Visitors, who were only admitted in small groups, stared at the many new things they saw before them. Aunt Louise's picture books were very popular; the animals depicted in them were easily recognized and much admired. The next destination was the town in the district of Kaf, four days' journey away, where the priesthood of the Ogaden has its headquarters. The route leads with little difficulty, first through thorns, then through barren land, without a trace of pasture. There were plenty of wells and a real river, the first since Bur=o. Near the city of priests the first traces of agriculture, producing dura. Wild cotton is also present, but there is no sign of it being cultivated. The camp is set up in friendly, fresh green terrain and fortified as a precaution. The priests' residence - James says "sironghold" - is sighted on a hill. The people who water the cattle at the wells about a mile away are scolded for bringing kafirs into the country. Meanwhile, a lively trade develops in the camp: women bring milk and grain and trade glass beads, but they are choosy, and James' brother, who runs the business, has as sour a job as a salesman in an elegant European fashion magazine. In the rainy season, the area around Faf turns into a vast lake and quagmire that breeds violent malaria outbreaks. The Tug Fafan, which is a dry river delta outside this period, is too narrow to contain the masses of water flowing down from the mountains, which therefore spread far and wide while the inhabitants retreat with their herds to the neighboring hills. The abbans sent to the priests brought good news. The high priest was friendly and announced his visit. He received handsome gifts, including a Koran. James describes Hadji Mahmud Nur as "tall, intelligent and courteous, with a thoughtful face whose sternness was tempered by a natural tendency to smile." He had made the pilgrimage to Mecca and had been to üden, and James is of the opinion that his influence on the natives extended very far. The onward journey went through undulating terrain well cultivated with grain, and the inhabitants of the numerous settlements here showed the foreigners great goodwill. Other caravans carrying grain from the Webbi followed. A three-day stop at the wells of Daberiag was used to buy food. Finally, the efforts and perseverance of the travelers should find their well-deserved reward: they see the sun of February 18th rise over the Webdi Schadäl, 59 days after leaving Berbera. A march of 1½ hours brings them to the edge of a stony plateau; more than 800 feet below them they see a vast valley, lightly wooded, covered with herds and huts, crossed by a threefold bright silver stripe, its banks shaded by mast-like, magnificent, fresh-green trees. The descent into the river valley, although arduous for the pack animals, proceeds without accident, and an hour after the first sight of the Wedbl, the travelers can set up camp half a mile from its banks in the midst of the Rür Hammer. The Webbi was now 60 yards wide at this point, whereas a week ago it had been almost dry. The river was teeming with crocodiles, and one of the Englishmen hit one of these monsters, which was sunning itself on a small island in the river, with a well-aimed shot, so fortunately that it lay dead on the bank, by which feat the superiority of European weapons was demonstrated to the natives The Kär Hammer are farmers, but their produce is only sufficient to meet their own needs. James says they are darker, shorter and heavier built than the Somalis we have seen so far, more like the Suahili=Negers. They are peaceful and do not fight among themselves or with their Shabali neighbors. The Sultan of the latter joined the caravan and led the travelers to his residence, the village of Barri, as James calls it. I cannot quite agree with this name. In Somali, Barri means East, and in the present case it is understood to mean an area comprising several tribes, namely, according to the Reide, the Habr Saleban, the Marehan and the Ha Wadle in addition to the Shabäli. In contrast to this are the tribes of the west, the Rär Galbed, as they were mentioned to me: The Autiyehan, the Aodallah, the Abudwak, the Senmuräto the Karanleh and the Jme. The tribes of the west are said to each have a city (bender, somewhat deviating from the usual meaning of this word), of the eastern tribes only the Habr Saleban. The border between east and west seems to be the Webbi, for we find the Aulivedan, to whom James translates as one, in the Galbed. The position of the Hawadle in the Barri is also confirmed by James, who says that the Shabäli, on their way to Madishu, which they call Hamar, in order to avoid the territory of the hostile Hawadle, prefer to take the road on the right side of the river. We find the words Barri and Galbed on Habenicht's map, east and west of the northern Somali coast, indicative; the latter, however, is erroneously printed as Dalbed in the second edition. Neither the person of the sultan nor the information received about his character were suitable to earn him the special trust of the travelers. The Zeriba he had erected was situated below the Dorses and was without shelter or shade, so that James felt compelled, in the interest of his safety and despite all persuasion, to set up camp at another spot close to the river, where thick bushes formed a strong natural hedge between him and the village. The sultan's main concern was to use the enormous power his guests had at their disposal for his political purposes. He was from the Hawiya=Somali tribe and, like his ancestors, had ruled over 56 villages of the Shabäli, when recently about half of his subjects rebelled against him and elected another sultan. He would now have preferred to take up arms against the rebels with the help of the English in order to bring them back under his rule, but James withdrew from this request under various pretexts and only undertook peaceful mediation between the opponents. The fear that the mighty foreigners might assist their former master against them soon led the revolted villages and their sultan back to obedience, and the English now had to exercise greater caution lest the reconciled enemies betray them together. Like the Sultan, the ruling class belonged to the Hawipas. With their small numbers, it is difficult to understand how they were able to maintain a permanent regiment over a completely different race, which was in no way inferior to them in strength, was well armed and formed the great majority. James too
