poor diet is the explanation. The whole of his time in prison is spent sleeping at a leisurely pace, interrupted only by short breaks for meals, during which the food is often better than that to which he was accustomed at home. The view of prison held by one such customer, who had only recently been released from prison after serving a sentence of three months, was probably quite common among them. When asked how he found it there, he replied: "I live in a big house, get plenty of chop and nothing to do" ("I live in a big house, get plenty to eat and nothing to do"). So it seems that it is not enough that these rogues commit crimes, they also have to be maintained at the expense of the state without any benefit to themselves. It has no prison, but sentences the criminal to public labor, which, although adapted to the strength of each individual, is always very severe. Three of them are coupled together and work under the supervision of a black soldier with a loaded gun. The one who is lazy gets to taste the terrible river whip. In this way they benefit the state instead of costing it money, and at the same time suffer a real punishment. Without flattering the blacks and making them puffed up by a pretended equality with the whites, the government wins the confidence and devotion of the natives by always trying to judge fairly to the best of its ability. In one and the same line the lowly slave stands next to the rich chief. Here, too, the difference in the treatment of the blacks is evident. The Englishman tries to accustom them little by little to order and obedience through leniency and forbearance, but usually has a lot of complaints with them; the German, on the other hand, intervenes all at once and then always keeps his thumb on their eye, not hard, but with even pressure and vigilance, and the result of this is that he rarely has much complaint with them; this applies at least to Cameroon. For those who rule over blacks, whether it is a public authority that does so over the population of a country, or a private person who does so over his servants, it is necessary to assert authority with firmness and, if necessary, with great severity, and to see strictly that it is always and everywhere respected. He who treats the Negro in this way, and at the same time shows him justice with benevolence, can be assured of his devotion and respect. He only respects strength and power No matter how much kindness you shower upon a negro, if it is not coupled with severity, you will not gain his respect, but rather the opposite, for he will regard kindness as weakness, which in his eyes is worse than, I might almost say, any crime. All who visit the colonies are displeased at the attitude of the government and the appearance of the blacks. However, it will not be easy to change this relationship. We have a copy of the population in Sierra Leone near us in the inhabitants of the old English mission town of Victoria, but they have improved a lot since 1887, when they came under Germany. For the administration of the general affairs of the place, the English government had set up a council or court of justice consisting of the most distinguished black inhabitants, which was given the illustrious name "Royal Court of Equity" and whose chairman called himself President. This president, who was the only one in the whole assembly who understood anything, also had executive power. It goes without saying that such a concession must have given these blacks a very high opinion of themselves; they also endeavored to show their power on all occasions, in good and bad times, but especially they tried, with ill-concealed glee, to harass all the whites who were so unfortunate as to have to do with Victoria. When Victoria became German, the "Court" disappeared, and its members were the first to have to learn the art of obedience. Without the people being accustomed to obedience to the government, little or nothing can naturally be accomplished for the country, which is why the government takes great care to find it everywhere, and does not think much of enforcing it by force if necessary. However, such a strong policy always runs the risk of degenerating into harshness, and too much severity is often more dangerous than too much leniency. However, there is no need to fear that this will happen in Cameroon as long as the current governor, Baron von Soden, remains in office. He has the difficult art of always finding the right balance. With a sure eye, he immediately recognized the true nature of the regent. The blacks are big children, uneducated and willful, but they have many good qualities. They need an educator who knows how to punish and reward. If they are disobedient and rebellious or commit a major oversight, he gives them a well-deserved chastisement, which can sometimes be quite severe, but when he has taken them where he wants them to go, he often knows how to win them over with a friendly and pleasant demeanor, coupled with thoughtful generosity. In the short time he has been governor of Cameroon, he has done much for the good of the colony. When he took office three years ago, it was a new and wild country that he took over; everything had to be started from scratch. A large number of laws and regulations have since been issued and put into force, the population along the coast and the rivers has learned to obey, and trade has been partly liberalized by allowing the inhabitants of Biktoria and Bimbia to go up the Mungo and Cameroon Rivers and trade there, and by allowing people from there to go to Bimbia's old trading places and down to Bibundi for this purpose. The interior of the colony has been traveled and mapped in many directions, and the governor himself has not shied away from the hardships and discomforts of traveling to remote and unknown areas both in Batanga and in Cameroon proper and on the so-called Ol River. The exploration and mapping of these rivers up to the falls and their extensive delta country up to the border of Calabar was carried out on the initiative and under the supervision of the Gonverneur, who made several and often long journeys there. Through the introduction of an annual spirit tax and customs duty on most trade goods, the governorate has obtained a certain, not insignificant income, which has enabled it to carry out several important buildings, despite the rather large funds granted by the German Reichstag. In Cameroon, for example, a massive governor's house has been erected on a beautifully situated site and surrounded by an extensive park, which is well maintained and in which a number of well-built farm buildings have found their place. A wide, well-maintained path leads from the governor's house through the villages of Joß. Bell and Aqua. Magnificent bridges have been built where the road crosses the river Crecks. In Victoria, a wide road has been built from the harbor through the village. From the harbour you can reach the road by means of a wide, stone staircase surrounded by four brick pillars, the two largest of which carry a brightly lit lantern and a 27-metre high mast for signaling. The path leads over the stream that flows out here on a long, solid bridge with six stone pillars, two of which each carry a lantern. The intention is to continue this path gradually along the coast until it reaches Bibundi after a few years. On the top of a steep hill across the creek is a two-storey wooden villa-style house for the governorate. It is said that the intention is to lay a telephone cable between this building and an expeditious premises at the harbor, the first of its kind outside here. In Bibundi a landmark 90 feet high has been erected, which is one of the highest there is. News from the Society. - The Society's Committee held a meeting on July 8 in the Society's offices under the chairmanship of Mr. Sachse, Director of the Imperial Post Office, at which the Chairman reported on the Board meeting and general meeting held in Cologne on January 30 and July 1. He emphasized first and foremost the extraordinarily amiable and friendly manner in which the Cologne section had welcomed the representatives of the Committee and the other sections; he also stressed that the discussions from beginning to end had been conducted in a spirit of conciliation and comradeship; that there had been no disagreement anywhere and that, thanks to the general effort to eliminate any differences of opinion, a satisfactory agreement had been reached on all points under discussion. It was also worth emphasizing the lively regret expressed by all those present that our esteemed President, His Serene Highness Prince of Hohenlohe-Langendurg, was prevented by illness from taking part in person in the negotiations, to whose preparations he had so substantially contributed. Moving on to the individual items on the Cologne agenda, the Chairman reported on the meeting of the Board of Directors on June 30. June: a) the agenda for the General Meeting submitted to the Board was approved; b) the motion of the Cologne Division concerning the budget was withdrawn for the General Meeting and, at the request of the Division, referred to the Committee for consideration at the next budget meeting; e) the motion of the Berlin Division to grant honorary membership of the Society to Reichskommissar Major von Wißmann was approved; d) the motion of the Waldenburg Division concerning next year's budget was referred to the Committee. The report on the Annual General Meeting can be reproduced here as having already appeared in the newspaper. The Committee referred the motion of the Cologne Division to the united Finance and Press Commissions for consideration, then approved the statutes of the Flensburg Division, took note of the grateful efforts of the Augsburg Division to recruit new members, learned of a letter from Mr. Perrot in Wiesbaden, who reported the formation of a German maritime trading company, Perrot & Co. and adjourned until September 2 of that year. New departments, which we wish the best of success, have been formed in Essen a. R. and Lübeck. Small announcements. - (Najor von Wißmann), who was suffering from rheumatism and asthma, is on the road to recovery. He is staying in Lauterberg, where Mr. von Gravenreuth and Dr. Tumiller are also staying. A lively dispute has arisen between him and the representatives of Protestant missiology, as he considers a change in mission methodology based on the principle of labora et ora to be necessary if the Protestant mission is to bear the same fruit as the Catholic mission. We will not go into the dispute in detail here, as Wißmann will take the opportunity after his recovery to make proposals to remedy the situation, but will only remind you that we already published a very important article by No. Hübbe=Schleiden in 1887 (23rd issue of December 1), "The impractical use of missionary funds", which will be followed by a rebuttal in the next issue.

Page 196

followed by V. Grundemann. Incidentally, the same antagonism, which has been prevalent between Wißmann and the missionary methodologists, had already led to sharp disputes between Hübde Schleiden and F. M. Zahn far earlier. (See Allgemeine Missionszeitschrift 1881 and 1883.) - (The preparatory work for laying the cable) from Sanstbar to the coast has already begun after the housing and working conditions in Bagamoyo have been arranged. (Gifts for the Catholic mission). With the steamer "Reichstag", which set sail on July 23, the company A. Walhorn in Münster sends an export article that is unlikely to be exported domestically: a magnificent harmonium worth 1500 marks, specially built for the tropical climate. The instrument is a gift from the magazine "Gott will es" and the master has spared nothing to deliver a work that can do honor to the German industry. The gift is intended for the Catholic mission in Dar es Salaam. - According to the "Kolonialblatt", the Africa Association has provisionally allocated a sum of 100,000 marks for a mission house to be built in German Africa, 10,000 marks for the Fathers of the Holy Spirit in Bagamojo and 2,000 marks for the Algerian missionaries. - (The work for the Colonial Council) is being continued with great enthusiasm in the circles concerned, in keeping with the importance of the subject, so that one can hope to hear of a finished project as early as the fall. The question of organization is likely to cause some difficulties, as the systems used in other countries, such as England and France, cannot be easily transferred to our as yet undeveloped colonial conditions. We still completely lack the many years of colonial experience of the people who sit on such bodies in other countries, which gives their advice particular weight, since, with a few exceptions, the majority of the people working in our colonies can only look back on a few years of activity. Nevertheless, the number of important and active people should already be so large and the knowledge of individual areas so advanced that it may be possible to form sections covering the individual colonies to discuss individual points, e.g. the budget. Since even progressive newspapers have become friends of the Colonial Council, the trust placed in it seems to be general. However, the progressive press still has the rovervatio mentalis that the Colonial Council should only be approved if the practical business side has a majority in it. We do not know whether it will have the majority, but it will be very strongly represented, as is natural, since businessmen are also the leading figures in the colonial acquisition companies, as a glance at the lists of the administrative and management boards shows. (According to the statutes of the Deutsch=ostafrikanische Gesellschaft, the Imperial Chancellor appoints three members to the Board of Directors, while the Royal General Directorate of the Seehandlungssozietät sends one member. This arrangement has proved to be very beneficial, as it has guaranteed cooperation between the government and the Society, which was particularly important in dealing with questions of constitutional law and organization. As the sphere of activity of Dr. Kayser, who had been active for the German-East African Society for years, has become considerably larger as a result of the new formation of the Kelonial Department, the Director of the Imperial Post Office, Sachse, has been considered for the Board of Directors in his place. The German=East African Maritime Trade). Among the East African coastal locations that now enjoy particular favor, Tanga occupies one of the first places, both because of its good harbor and because of its proximity to Usambara and its relatively favorable climate. As is known, the planters' society has already settled near Amboni, the Protestant East African mission has also acquired land there, the Magdeburg factories have been established there, the German East African Society intends to set up factories there and have the starting point for a later railroad to the Usambara Mountains begun here, and the gentlemen of the Hoffmann Somali expedition will establish plantations there. Recently, however, even more plants are planned there, especially as it is very favorable that the first German mail steamer is landing in Tanga. The German-East African Sea Association (with its headquarters in Wiesdaden) will now also be working among them, which will initiate trade relations. The purpose of the company is the establishment of plantations, trading, commercial facilities and ventures in all areas of transportation. The Society will also do its utmost to promote our Protestant mission and our German national interests in East Africa. Its representative, who is already leaving on the steamer bound for East Africa on July 23, is Dr. Karl Kaerger, who is well known to our readers for his work on Brazil. It is to be regarded as a great step forward when people now also enter the service of the colonial cause who are not unilaterally practically or theoretically trained, but who unite both directions as a result of their entire development. Especially for the first cultural work, not only agronomists and merchants are needed, but also men experienced in tropical culture and familiar with local life, who, due to their previous education, can easily orient themselves and, with their eyes focused on the general, are able to study the particular in detail. If, as it seems, Tanga is developing rapidly, it will not be long before the mail steamers have to call here, especially as the German East African line is to meet the needs of our colonization. (His Majesty the Emperor) has, according to the Colonial Gazette, granted the Association for Protestant Mission in Cameroon a one-off grant of 2000 marks.
- (Emil Meyger), our esteemed colleague, died suddenly in Stuttgart. Born in 1836, after passing his engineering exams he went to Holland, where he worked for fifteen years, finally as head of the trigonometric department. He was one of the best connoisseurs of Dutch India and his passing leaves a painful gap. - (A South African newspaper), the successor to the defunct "Kapland", has emerged in Cape Town as the only organ of the Germans in South Africa. We wish it the best of success, which will certainly not fail to materialize if it endeavours to fully fulfil its programme: to represent the interests of the Germans in South Africa, to promote German trade and colonization efforts in the East and West African territories and to maintain the national intellectual assets. The printer and publisher is Hermann Michaelis in Cape Town. Entrances for the library. Given the limited space available to us for book reviews, it will not be possible to discuss all works in detail, but we never fail to recommend new colonial writings, which are assigned to our library by the authors and publishers, to colonial friends in word and deed, for which the administration of the library is given ample opportunity by our members. For the books donated to our library, we would like to express our sincere thanks once again Received in June. Andersoa, Ch J.

The memorandum on the motives for the German-English agreement, which was published in the Reichsanzeiger after the Heligoland Bill was passed by the English Parliament, brings together in a very clear and skillful grouping the various factors that were decisive for the government's policy in this new phase, but without containing anything substantially new that could modify the verdict on the treaty as expressed by the general meeting of the German Colonial Society in Cologne. Since the memorandum has been widely circulated in the press, we can refrain from publishing the entire document and will limit ourselves to emphasizing the main points. The memorandum begins by emphasizing the necessity of not allowing the effects of the differences in colonial matters with England to extend to general policy and thereby endanger it, and presents this as the foremost objective of the negotiations. "The idea of being forced to break with England in the last resort for the sake of a colonial quarrel must not be allowed to gain ground. There could be no doubt that our colonial possessions were by no means materially valuable enough to outweigh the disadvantages of a war that would shake our mutual prosperity to the core! But it was not only war with weapons in hand that had to be avoided; the enmity of nations, the embitterment of sentiment in wider circles of interested parties, the diplomatic hatred must not be allowed to find any ground in our colonial possessions. We urgently wish to transfer the old good relations with England to the future. It remains to be seen to what extent a commonality of interests or documented treaties are capable of binding the policies of states for longer periods of time in our fast-moving times, despite all changes in people and circumstances. Undoubtedly, however, the surest means for a friendly understanding between two states can be sought in the long run by endeavoring to find and settle all those points which, bearing the seeds of future entanglements, could alienate the nations from each other over time. The more politics has to reckon with national sentiment, with a heightened sense of honor among the peoples, the more it must strive to remove the first beginnings of national resentment at an early stage These points of view are in themselves certain of general approval, but only on condition that a certain reciprocity is guaranteed. From the provisions of the treaty, however, one does not get the impression that this was done in the same way by the British side. The significance of the whole agreement in the future and the question of the extent to which it will really harm German interests in Africa or not will depend essentially on whether or not Germany's love of peace will be unilaterally or overwhelmingly pursued in the implementation of the provisions of the agreement, which will often give rise to disputes. If the reception of the treaty by the people is the surest criterion of its greater or lesser excellence, the fact remains that the English are completely satisfied, the Germans only partially, and, as far as we can see, the publication of the memorandum has changed nothing in this respect. Moving on to the individual territories, the memorandum states that the establishment of the German-English border of the Togo territory makes German traffic with the hinterland safer and considerably easier, and that the caravan route leading through previously disputed territory now lies in recognized German territory, which could only be achieved through the compliance of England, which had claims there that were difficult to dispute. This agreement was certainly an advantage for the development of trade. The area around Salaga is known to have been neutralized and it is said that, in any case, Germany would have the right to claim priority over undertakings that could affect this neutrality on the basis of the protection treaties concluded by Captain von François. This passage probably refers to any French claims that might be raised on the basis of the treaties concluded by Captain Binger in 1888. In that year, Binger had visited Wagadhogo, the capital of Moschi, which Captain v. Francois had approached to within a few days' journey. The northernmost point reached by the latter is Sürma. It is said that the negotiations between England and France on the delimitation of spheres of interest, which were initiated on the occasion of the Anglo-German agreement, also extend to West Africa, so that this clause may become important later on. As far as Cameroon is concerned, after an overview of the favorable development of the country, the memorandum states that the provision made, according to which transit traffic between the German and English territories and Lake Chad should be free and not subject to any transit tax, should prove to be extremely useful for Cameroon after the elimination of intermediate trade. Even if English ventures in those countries were to preempt Germany, this would keep free trade open for our protectorate with the rich Mohammedan peoples settled in these regions. Such a remark clears the field, so to speak, and gives the English claimants around Lake Chad an entitlement to these territories. That they will take advantage of this is clear from the fact that the Royal Niger Company claims to have concluded a treaty with the Kingdom of Borgu, placing it under the English flag. Furthermore, according to a claim made on the Royal Riger Company's general insurance policy, treaties have been concluded with the kingdoms of Sokoto and Gandu, giving the company complete jurisdiction over all persons who do not belong to its nationality. As the Royal Niger Company is already laying claim to the right bank of the Benus above Hola, it seems that we have all but given up on extending our sphere of interest to Lake Chad. In addition, the French also intend to penetrate northwards from Übangi, for which purpose the French
Page 198

Crampel, a traveler who explored the northern part of Gabon two years ago, touching our hinterland, is said to be on his way. At this moment, when the French press is trying to create a mood for the expansion of French possessions in West Africa, it is appropriate to point out a French opinion regarding Cameroon. Even in the scientific colonial French journals, one finds the legend developing that the 15th degree east longitude of Greenwich is the eastern boundary of our Cameroon colony. The French are of the opinion that all the land between the 15th longitude and the Ubangi, where they already have some stations, belongs to them. In the face of these claims of the French, however, who wish to confine us to the 15th degree, it is time to declare energetically that the German government has only undertaken in the protocol of December 24, 1885, to refrain from any political influence from a line which follows the Campo River from its mouth to the 10th degree east longitude of Greenwich and from this point to its parallel of latitude up to the point of intersection of the latter with the 15th degree east longitude of Greenwich. With the surprising rapidity with which demarcations are now being made and spheres of interest created in areas that were quite unknown a short time ago, we will have to deal with France as soon as possible about the borders of the hinterland of Cameroon and the French Congo. One could almost say that the present moment is particularly favorable for this, since territories are now being determined everywhere that no white man has ever set foot on for vast distances. With regard to South West Africa, the memorandum's view that the protectorate is well suited for settlement by German farmers and for cattle breeding, especially in those parts extending from Herero Land southwards to about 26 degrees south latitude, is in line with our view. The prerequisite, however, was that the necessary transportation routes be provided and a corresponding outlet created for sales. From this passage it can probably be deduced that the imperial government will in future support the efforts being made to open up this land to German colonization. What has been said about the value or rather the lack of value of Walfischbai is probably correct, as the harbor is indeed becoming increasingly silted up. It is also true that the assertion that the harbor is an expedient starting point for the route into the interior, which is the shortest from here, is questionable in this overall view. An expert on the country has already explained to the writer that he does not attach too much importance to Walfischbai, as it is mainly only important as Otjimbinque. Nevertheless, Welshbai remains a stake in the German flesh, as the Cape Government, as late as July 31, unanimously adopted a motion of Sir Thomas Upington to the effect that the Cape Colony would reject any interference with the direct control of the Cape Parliament over the Welshbai area. The policy of the Cape Government, which, as a result of the Afrikaner policy of the new Governor-General Cecil Rhodes, is aimed at forcing the Germans out of South West Africa, may cause us difficulties not only in Welshbai, but also in our south-eastern corner of the protectorate, where Dr. Goering is now staying in order to settle matters. The claims of the Sultan of Witu to Manda and Patta are presented as very uncertain, and he himself is described as a very insignificant prince whose dominion extends only moderately inland. Even Hohenzollernhafen no longer finds favor, just as the production of this area is described as negligible. The intention is too obvious to be convincing; German policy has not been able to win any laurels in the handling of the Witu question for years. In so far as the agreement concerns the German-East African sphere of interest, it is based on agreements made in 1886 and 1889, i.e. still by Prince Bismarck, and it is reported that the German side was told in London in mid-1887 that the 1886 agreement was based on the assumption that England would give us a free hand for the future south of Lake Victoria and east of Lake Tanganyika and Lake Nyassa. The English government declared its agreement with this view on the condition that the German government would not permit any acquisitions in the rear of the English sphere of interest. The German government accepted this. In a note from Count Hatzfeldt to Lord Saliobury of August 19 of the previous year, inspired by the Foreign Office, it says in this regard
"In confirmation of this view, the Imperial Government, on the occasion of an expedition intended by the German side for the relief of Emin Pasha, has expressly declared that Uganda, Wadelai and other territories lying north of the first degree of south latitude are outside the sphere of German colonial endeavors. Thus, the much-regretted abandonment of Uganda is not due to a lack of appreciation of this country by the present German government, but to the fact that it could no longer envisage taking possession of it. The basic idea of the agreement was to secure a contiguous possession where there would be sufficient material for our cultural work for half a century. The bold men who, driven by enthusiasm, have acquired these vast territories for Germany deserve our fullest recognition. But the period of flag-hoisting and treaty-making must come to an end in order to make use of what has been acquired. After the cession of the coastal strip, the government could gradually transition from a state of war to direct imperial administration and proceed to peaceful work in cooperation with the German East African Society. Only now would the government have the opportunity to realize its will to raise the German East African Society and to generate the funds that would make imperial subsidies unnecessary. It is to be hoped that the establishment of clear conditions and the feeling of security under the protection of the government will also give capital a new impetus to turn its attention to these areas. - In this respect, every colonial friend will gladly agree with the government's endeavors. *) With regard to the protectorate over Zanzibar, the discussion begins with a historical development concerning England's long-standing relations with the Sultanate and the difficulty for us in gaining a firm foothold there vis-à-vis England and France in view of the well-known declaration of March 10, 1862, which will still cause England some unpleasantness with France. However, if it is said that in this situation there are all the fewer reservations about granting a friendly power the protectorate over Zanzibar and Pemba, as there is no reason to assume that German companies and individuals on the island will fare badly under English protection, we dare to doubt this in view of such events as the "Hönigsberg case" and the Fiji land claims. What is said against the view that Zanzibar has a dominant position on the coast is in line with the remarks of Consul Vohsen; experience will have to show which view of the value of the island was the correct one. The memorandum concludes its remarks on Africa with the sentence that "certain disappointments were unavoidable in the transition from the first surge of colonial ideas to serious work limited in its aims. The part of the memorandum relating to Heligoland is very instructive and factually significant. It was undoubtedly only for the sake of the explanations set out here that the publication of the document was postponed until the moment when the final seal was placed on the agreement in England. Had the opposition there, and in particular the British colonial interests, been aware of the real importance of the island for the defense of Germany, as it now emerges in the memorandum, who knows whether their active agitation would not have succeeded in bringing together a majority in favor of raising the price. The government's memorandum merely confirms what had previously only been hinted at in naval circles without any recognizable authority, namely that the Kiel Canal would not guarantee the unification of the German naval forces in the North and Baltic Seas even after its completion, as long as an enemy fleet found a base near Heligoland. It is also confirmed that there was already a plan to build a second canal between Wilhelmshaven and Kiel in order to avoid an enemy fleet anchored at Heligoland, *) The "Freisinnige Zeitung", which otherwise agrees with the agreement in every respect, comments: "The wording of this passage leaves open the question of whether the government still intends to support the German East African Society from imperial funds. In our opinion, the will to raise the German East African Society has been sufficiently demonstrated by the suppression of the East African uprising and by the funds approved by the Reichstag for this purpose. In our opinion, there can be no question of further material support for society from the government after the suppression of the uprising. On the contrary, the Company's primary task will be to reimburse the costs caused by the uprising as far as possible, all the more so as the uprising was in fact sparked solely by the ineptitude of the Company's officials

Page 199

an undertaking that would have entailed enormous costs. The German Empire was thus saved many millions by the acquisition of Heligoland, which is easy to read between the lines of the memorandum. Dr. Peters. From Mlala (2 marches to Muininsagara), June 23, 1890, Dr. Peters submitted a report to the executive committee of the German Emin Pasha Committee, from which we learn the following: "In Mpuapua I finally met Emin Pasha, a moving conclusion to my expedition. I am not ashamed to admit that I was deeply shaken after the terrible exertion of the last year. And I had the feeling that Emin Pasha was not unmoved either. We were together for two days, and there we reached agreements which substantially achieved the political purpose of my expedition at the last hour. I request permission to present this entire area of my work to the esteemed committee in person. I am extremely pleased with the recognition that the esteemed committee has paid to my work. I can confess that, no matter how bitter some of the feelings I have carried to Africa, I have always been conscious of working in the national interest and determined, if necessary, to put my heart and soul into it. But in my heart of hearts I am grateful to the honorable committee and its board for the loyal support I found there in critical hours. In Mpuapua I found that my telegraphic message: "Christian party returned" was not fully understood, as it seemed to compete with Stokes' activities. I therefore give the following data: Mwanga with Stokes' help defeated Karema on October 4, 1889, then I think Stokes left. In any case, on November 22, 1889, Karema and the Wanjoro totally defeated the Christian party and chased them all to the islands of Nyanza. On February 10, 1890, the Askaris Mwangas gained an advantage over the Wanjoro and Karema and chased them from Nyanza. Meanwhile, Karema remained in northern Uganda and the Christians stayed on the islands because the victory was not decisive enough. On February 18, 1890, I crossed the Nile. Before our approach, with its extravagant rumors, Karema withdrew to Unjoro and only when I was at Kisallo sallo, a mile north of Mengo, the night before my arrival, did the court return with the Europeans. I am the bearer of a letter from Mwanga to His Majesty the Emperor and to the King of the Belgians. From Ukumbi I marched to Ugogo by the shortest route - 7 days closer than the more comfortable route via Usongo, Stanley's route: Route Nera, Busika, Wembwere=Steppe, Iramba, Ussure, Uweriweri. The route in its context is new, even though some parts of it are traversed by Stanley, Fischer and Wilson. I had a skirmish with the Wasekke in Nera. At Ufika, Iramba, Ussure I made treaties of submission and hoisted the flag. - In Mukalale, Muhamed bin Omari, a Tabora=Arab, came to pay his tribute. In Mtive the Wagogo chased my people from the water because I had not paid Hongo. However, when they made a hostile attack on our camp, we repulsed them with bloody heads, whereupon peace was made. The following day I arrived at Makenge, the feared sultan of the country. He made peace overtures to me, but suddenly, as we were sitting at table, he attacked our camp with 12-1500 men, some armed with shotguns. We drove them off in a half-hour battle, and I then attacked the gentlemen in their villages, leaving Mr. von Tiedemann to protect the camp. After four hours of fighting in the blazing heat, I managed to hit the Wagogo on the head, killing 50 of them. I now threatened to stay until there was no one left alive in the whole country. I would not have been able to do this because my men had already shot their ammunition. Makenge, for his part, sent Hongo (tribute) during the night, begging for peace: 2½ Frasilah ivory, 38 slaughter oxen, 10 sheep, honey rc. xc The following day his son sent 20 oxen. So I had another herd to take with me to the coast. From the hot sun and all the shooting I lost my hearing for two days and had a kind of sunstroke. Stanley had been comfortable paying Makenge Hongo. Now a Wanjamwest and an Arab expedition lying nearby called me out as joint leader, and so I suddenly had over 2000 men at my disposal. No more Mgogo to be seen as far as Mpuapua." So much for the report of our bold traveler! Dr. Peters has now set off on his return journey to Europe and will probably arrive back home in the second half of this month, having risked his life and health for 1½ years in the service of a great cause. Dr. Peters has carried out the task assigned to him, as far as he was able, with a dedication, perseverance and prudence that deserve admiration. On his return, he can be assured of the warmest appreciation from all those who have enough national feeling to be proud when a German compatriot in distant lands distinguishes himself through strength and heroism to the extent that Peters has done. The German-English Agreement of July 1, 1890, viewed from the standpoint of constitutional law and the law of nations. By Karl von Stengel, Professor of Law. From the moment that the essential content of the agreements reached between Germany and England was made public in a special edition of the Reichs-Anzeiger on June 17 of this year, the German-English agreement of July 1 caused great excitement in all circles in which interest in our colonies is alive. It was in the nature of things that initially only the economic and political aspects of the agreement were considered and, accordingly, what effects the treaty would have on the development of German colonial policy in general and the future of our East African protectorates in particular. This consideration essentially led to a derogatory assessment of the Convention. However, in order to obtain an exhaustive judgment in every respect, it is necessary to subject the Convention to a thorough examination from the standpoint of international law and constitutional law and to examine which rights the German Reich has acquired or relinquished through the Convention. The answer to this question depends essentially on the preliminary question of what rights the German Reich is entitled to with regard to the protected territory in general and the protected areas affected by the Convention in particular. However, the Convention affects all of Germany's African colonies, whereas the Treaty does not refer to those in the South Seas. As far as the protectorate of the German East African Company is concerned, the territories that Dr. Peters acquired through various treaties concluded in November and December 1884 with the rulers of Usagara, Ngurn, Useguha and Ukami are of particular interest. These territories, covering some 2500 square miles and extending from the coastal strip under the sovereignty of the Sultan of Sanstbar to 36 degrees east longitude to the west, were expressly placed "under the protection of the German Empire" by the Imperial Protective Charter of February 25, 1885. In the years 1885 and 1886, however, the representatives of the German East African Society succeeded in considerably expanding their territory through a number of treaties with native rulers. First, a) the lands north and northeast of the territories mentioned in the letter of protection of February 27, 1885, Usambara, Bondei, Para, Ugono and Dschagga were acquired. Arusha and Kahe; furthermore d) partly in the south and southwest of the aforementioned territory the lands of Kdutu, Usaramo, Ubama, Mabenge, Wamaschonde and Wagindo, c) partly in the north and northeast the lands of Girgama, Sabaki, Gala, Ukamba and Kast, d) finally north of the Tana River a large part of the Somali lands up to the Bender=Gasen on the Gulf of Aden. As a result, the company's acquisitions extended from the Rovuma River in the south (11 degrees south latitude) to Kay Guardafui (12 degrees north latitude) and in the Gulf of Aden to 49 degrees east longitude (Bender Gasen), while the rest of the border in the west was fairly undefined. In the east, the company's acquisitions were limited by the coastal strip in the Somali region under the sovereignty of the Sultan of Zanzibar, but by the sea. Before any recognition of these acquisitions of the Company, which were subject to the terms of the letter of protection, had been given by the Imperial Government, Germany and England concluded the Convention of 2 October 1886 on the delimitation of their spheres of interest in East Africa. 1 This agreement contained first of all the recognition of the islands and coastal stretches under the sovereignty of the Sultan of Zanzibar and also referred to the area bounded to the south by the Rovuma River (Kay Delgado) and to the north by a line which, starting from the mouth of the Tana River, follows the course of this river or its tributaries to the intersection of the Aquakor with the 38th meridian of east longitude and then follows the course of the Tana River or its tributaries to the 38th meridian of east longitude. It then continues in a straight line to the intersection of the 1st degree of north latitude with the 37th degree of east longitude, where the line ends. What lies north of this line is not affected by the agreement at all. Apart from the Witu area north of the Tana, this also applies to the Somali countries. Within the area now delimited by the aforementioned lines (Rovuma in the south, Tana in the north), the demarcation line between

Page 200

of the German and English spheres of interest in such a way that it starts from the mouth of the Umbe River (5 degrees longitude), runs in a straight line to Lake Jipe. It runs along the eastern shore and around the northern shore, crosses the Lumi River, cuts through the Taveta and Dschagga regions in the middle and continues in a straight line along the northern slope of the Kilimanjaro mountain range to the point on the eastern shore of Lake Victoria=Nyanza, which is crossed by the 1st degree south latitude. Germany undertook not to make any territorial acquisitions in the north of this line, not to take over any protectorates and not to oppose the expansion of British influence in the north of this line, while Great Britain assumed the same obligation for the territories lying to the south of this line. As already pointed out, of the above-mentioned acquisitions of the German East African Company, the Somali lands north of the Tana were not covered by the agreement at all. Of the other acquisitions made after the letter of protection of February 27, 1885, the territories located between the Tana River and the demarcation line leading northwest from the mouth of the Umbe, namely the Gallalands, the Sabaki region, the Gasi region, are tacitly relinquished by the Convention. Ukamba, Girgama, and part of the Jagga area. On the other hand, the rest of the Dichagga area, the lands of Usambara, Bondei, Ugono, Aruscha and Kahe, which extend to the northwest between the demarcation line and the northern border of the territories recognized in the Letter of Protection of 27 February 1885, which is partly formed by the Ruwu River at Pangani, lie within the demarcation line. The later acquisitions of the German-East African Company lying beyond the territory listed in the letter of protection of February 27, 1885 up to the Rovuma naturally fall entirely within the German sphere of interest. The Convention of July 1 has now maintained and further defined the northern and southern demarcation line as established by the Treaty of 1886, but has extended it further to the west. According to Article 1 (1) and (2), the German sphere of interest in East Africa is bounded in the north by a line which starts on the coast at the northern end of the mouth of the Umbe River*) and runs in a straight line to Lake Jipe. Along the eastern shore of the lake and around the northern shore, the line then crosses the Lumi River to cut through the Taveta and Dschagga landscapes in the middle and then continues in a straight line along the northern slope of the Kilima Rrscharo mountain range until it reaches the point on the eastern shore of Lake Victoria Nyanza that is hit by the furthest degree of latitude. From here, crossing the lake at the said latitude, it follows the latter to the border of the Congo State, where it ends. It is understood, however, that the German sphere of interest on the western side of the lake does not include the Mfumbiroberg. In the south, the German sphere of interest is bounded by a line which, extending along the coast from the northern border of the province of Mozambique, follows the course of the Rovuma River to the point where the M'sinjeftus flows into the Rovuma and from there continues westwards along the parallel to the shore of Lake Nyassa.") Then, turning northwards, it continues along the eastern, northern and western shores of the lake to the northern bank of the Sonzwe River. It then continues up this river to the point where it intersects the 33 degrees east longitude and follows it further to the point where it comes closest to the Greuie of the Congo Basin described in the first article of the Berlin Consensus, as shown on the map attached to the 9th Protocol. From here it proceeds in a straight line to the front imaginary boundary and runs along it to the point of intersection with the 32nd degree of east longitude; it then turns in a straight direction to the point of union of the north and south branches of the Kilambo River, which it then follows to its mouth in Lake Tanaanfika In the west, the boundary of the Denian sphere of interest according to Article Zisser 3 forms a line which, from the mouth of the Kilambo River to the 1st degree of Judean latitude, coincides with the boundary of the Denian sphere of interest according to Article Zisser 3. Finally, the eastern border of the German sphere of interest, which was previously formed by the ten-mile-wide coastal strip under the control of the Sultan of Zanzibar, shall in future be the sea. Since, according to Article XI, England has undertaken to persuade the Sultan to cede this strip of land and the island of Masia to Germany (cf. 1 below), Article XI refers to Wituland and the Somali lands, which were only placed under German protection in the autumn of 1889. In terms of content, Germany withdrew its patronage of Witn in favor of Great Britain and renounced its patronage of the coast bordering Witn up to Kismaju and its claims to territory on the mainland north of this coast and to the islands of Patta and Manda. With regard to the West African protectorate, an agreement had been reached between Germany and England in the spring of 1885, according to which England recognized the entire area from the Orange River to Cape Frio, with the exception of Walsischbal and the surrounding small area as well as the islands off Angra Pequena and Walsischbai, as a German protectorate and undertook to Accordingly, the town of Wanga at the mouth of the Umbe, in respect of which there were doubts under the Convention of 1886, also falls within the German sphere of interest. December 1886 on the delimitation of the German sphere of interest and the Portuguese possessions.
The German Protectorate is not to be extended to the west beyond longitude 20 degrees east (the border of the Betschuanaland, which is under British protectorate) and not to counteract the development of the German Protectorate up to this longitude. According to the new agreement, the boundary between the German and English spheres of interest under Article III is now to be delimited in the south by a line beginning at the mouth of the Orange River and running up the north bank of the river to the point where it meets the river at longitude 20 degrees east. In the east, the border forms a line which starts from the aforementioned point and follows the M. degree east longitude dis to its intersection with the 22nd degree south latitude; the line then runs east along this latitude to the point where it is met by the 21st degree east longitude. The line then follows this parallel eastward to the point where it is intersected by the 21st degree of easterly longitude, then continues northward to the said meridian to its intersection with the 18th degree of southerly latitude, then follows this parallel in a frequent direction until it reaches the Chobe River, and then continues along the valley of the main course of this river to its confluence with the Sambest, where it reaches its end. It is agreed that by this provision Germany shall have free access from its protectorate to the Sambest - which, according to the German-Portuguese Treaty of December 30, 1886, forms the border between the German sphere of interest and the Portuguese possessions - by means of a strip of land which at no point is less than 20 English miles wide. Finally, with regard to the delimitation of the Walsichbal, it is agreed that the continuation of the southern boundary of the British Walsischbaigebiet shall be reserved for decision by arbitration if no agreement is reached between the Powers on the boundary within two years. Article XI of the Convention refers to the West African protectorates, and in paragraph 1 the disputed boundary between the German Togo territory and the British Gold Coast colony is established, and in paragraph 2 an error is reported which has crept into the German-English treaty concerning the delimitation of the English and German spheres of interest in the Gulf of Guinea, in that this treaty refers to a river Rio del Rey, whereas in reality there is no such river. Turning now to the question of what rights the German Empire is entitled to in relation to the protectorates, it should be pointed out above all that, from the point of view of international law and constitutional law, the colonies can be divided into those which are subordinate to the mother country under constitutional law and are subject to its sovereignty in the same way as any other province, and those which are merely linked to the mother country under international law, i.e. over which the mother country exercises a so-called protective rule (protectorate). The first group can be called actual colonies, the second protectorates. While the colonies proper are overseas provinces over which the mother country exercises all state authority (legislation, administration and administration of justice), the legal subordination of the protectorate countries to the mother country is much more limited. A protectorate relationship consists in the fact that one of two states (the protectorate state) is subordinate in its foreign relations to the other (the protectorate) state and is therefore represented and protected by the latter in international relations. With regard to its internal relations, however, the protector state remains antonomous in principle and therefore continues to legislate independently within its territory. administration of justice and administration within its territory. The protectorate only has to put up with interference in these areas from the protectorate state to the extent that the protectorate state is entitled to do so under the protection treaty concluded. Accordingly, the protectorate relationship presupposes two states that are equal in and of themselves, one of which enters into a relationship of dependence with the other under international law by virtue of the treaty. Therefore, a protectorate over ownerless territories under international law is also excluded. However, ownerless territories in the sense of international law are not only territories which are not inhabited at all, but also those which are occupied by uncivilized peoples who lack a state organization recognized under international law, since such peoples are not, like civilized states, regarded as subjects of international law. In addition, in recent times the term protectorate is often misused in cases in which a suspicion of a protectorate is conceptually excluded and in reality a colony subject to the sovereignty of the mother country exists. This use of language could become all the more naturalized because there are often enough intermediate formations between the actual colonies and the protectorate countries and, as will be shown further on, it can often be doubtful how far the sovereignty of the mother country extends over a colony in individual cases. In particular, the ambiguous term "protectorate" is used with preference in cases where the sovereignty of a state in a territory is not yet firmly established by state institutions, or where one cannot speak of the exercise of sovereign rights at all, but only of the assertion of political influence. In the latter respect, the legal principles that are decisive for the acquisition of colonies come into consideration. These principles can be summarized by the fact that a protectorate is established by treaty between the sovereign state and the protectorate. However, colonies in territories that are ownerless under international law are acquired by occupation. For just as the occupier acquires ownership of property that is ownerless under private law by seizing it, so a state acquires sovereignty over a territory that is ownerless under international law by seizing it. Sovereignty. But for the occupation under international law to have the intended effect

It is not sufficient that possession of the territory in question is taken in a symbolic manner by hoisting flags, erecting boundary posts and the like. Rather, it is necessary to take possession of the territory in question in a symbolic manner by hoisting flags, erecting boundary posts and the like, but rather to actually take possession of it and assert it permanently by exercising state rule over the territory in question. In this sense, the Congo Act also stipulates in § 35 that an occupation on the coast of the African mainland should only be effective if the state concerned ensures the existence of an authority in the occupied territory that is sufficient to protect acquired rights If we now look at the German protectorates, it emerges that they were all established in territories without sovereignty under international law State-organized communities with which protectorate treaties could have been concluded did not exist in these territories. As a result, the German Reich could only acquire sovereignty over the relevant stretches of land through occupation. However, treaties were also concluded with the chiefs and sultans of the indigenous peoples in South West Africa, West Africa and East Africa, the content of which was that they "placed themselves under the protection of the Empire" or ceded their sovereign rights to the Empire - these treaties were not protectorate treaties in the true sense of the word, but merely signified the voluntary non-recognition of the Empire's rule by the representatives of the indigenous peoples. They do not constitute the legal title for the sovereignty of the empire over the territories concerned; this is given far more in the occupation, which only found a certain preparation and support in these treaties This point of view will also have to be adopted with regard to the Wituland; incidentally, the Sultan of Witn has ceded a 25 square mile part of his land "with all sovereign rights". In the extreme case, this treaty, as a cession treaty, would provide the legal title for German sovereignty over this territory. However, as far as the rest of the Sultan of Witu's intentions are concerned, it can be reasonably doubted whether the declarations exchanged between the Sultan and the Imperial Government in April and May 1885, the content of which was that the Sultan of Witu entered into a "friendly relationship" and "under the protection" of the Empire, were sufficient to establish a protectorate relationship between the Empire and Witu. Since it was not specified in any way what rights the German Empire was to have with regard to Witn, nor did the German Empire make any attempt to exercise sovereign rights over Witn, it can rather be said that the Sultan of Witu merely placed himself under the political influence of Germany without otherwise relinquishing his legal independence. If the point of view is correct that the German protectorates, despite their name, are not in a protectorate relationship with the Reich, but are actual colonies and thus subject to its sovereignty, the question now arises as to whether the Reich has done everything to acquire sovereignty over those territories designated as German protectorates by occupation, that it was not sufficient for this purpose that the German flag was hoisted by the commanders of German warships, Reich commissioners or other persons in the name of the Reich. Proclamations, etc., have already been emphasized. However, these acts were significant insofar as they expressed the will of the Reich government to take possession of the territory in question. But in order to make the occupation effective, this symbolic seizure, expressing the will to take possession, had to be accompanied by the actual seizure through the establishment of state rule. Indeed, state institutions were created in the protectorates either by the empire itself or by colonial societies authorized to do so by letters of protection. But since these institutions naturally do not yet extend over the entire extent of the large countries designated as protectorates, and since, on the other hand, the seizure of property is only effective to the extent that state rule, i.e. The result is that the vast territories which fall within the German sphere of interest on the basis of the treaties concluded with England, France and Portugal are only partially effectively occupied and ruled by the empire, even if it is difficult to draw a sharp line as to where the effective occupation ends. For the rest, one can only say that the German Reich has received assurances from the states concerned that they will not put any difficulties in the way of its seizure of possession within the recognized borders of the German spheres of interest. The treaties in question, in so far as they contain the delimitation of the spheres of interest, cannot therefore be regarded as the legal title to the sovereignty of the Reich over the protectorates affected by these treaties; the legal title to sovereignty always remains the completed occupation; the treaties only designate the extent of the territory within which the empire, unhindered by the objections of the states concerned, can preserve its sovereignty and, on the other hand, reject the seizure of possession by these states The subjugation treaties with the chiefs of the invaded peoples that initiate the seizure of possession have often been concluded by representatives of colonial societies and even by private individuals. Such persons have also carried out symbolic acts of seizure. In order to assess the legal scope of such acts, it should be noted that the establishment of sovereignty over a territory, whether by treaty or occupation, can only emanate from the holder of state power itself, as an aspect of constitutional or international law. Therefore, an act of acquisition carried out by a private person or company in relation to an ownerless territory can only have legal significance and effect for the German Reich if the person or company concerned was authorized to do so by the Reich government, or if the acts carried out by it were subsequently approved by the government. This is what happened with regard to the protectorates in question here, while on the other hand various "acquisitions" of the German-East African Company have remained without effect under constitutional and international law because the Imperial Government has denied them its subsequent authorization and approval, as was the case in particular with regard to most of the Somali lands. If one examines the two German-English conventions of June 1886 and July 1, 1890 in accordance with the legal aspects set out above1. Rovemder, the Convention of 1886 contains a demarcation of the mutual spheres of interest within the territory of the Rovuma in the south and the Tana in the north. Now that the demarcation line between the German and British spheres of interest was drawn from the mouth of the Umbe River westwards to Kilima Ajaro, the German Empire renounced the territory between the Umbe River and the northern boundary of the area covered by the letter of protection of February 25, 1885. This renunciation cannot, however, be legally understood as a cession of territory under German sovereignty, since the Imperial Government had neither recognized the acts of acquisition of the German East African Company with regard to the stretches of land in question, nor had it itself had these stretches of land olcupied by its organs. The renunciation could therefore only have the meaning that the German Empire agreed that England would establish its rule within the sphere of interest granted to it and that the Imperial Government at the same time promised not to take any action within this territory that would establish the rule of the Empire. Thus, the demarcation of the colonial sphere of interest between two states does not have the meaning of the cession or acquisition of sovereign rights, but only of the assurance not to anticipate and not to oppose the future establishment of such rights through occupation. Nevertheless, certain principles have gradually come to be recognized for such delimitations. These are, in particular, the principle that where one power occupies the coast, another power may not occupy the hinterland without its consent, and also the principle that such territories in which the nationals of a state have established branches should fall within the sphere of interest of the state concerned. Even if such acts by private individuals are not such as to give rise directly to the sovereignty of the state concerned, it is nevertheless equitable to grant the state the possibility of subjecting to its rule such territories brought into a certain connection with the home state by the colonizing activities of its nationals. As can be seen from the note from the Marquis of Salisbury to the Third Ambassador in Berlin on June 14, the German-English agreement was at least generally based on these principles. Accordingly, the southern border of the German sphere of interest was not drawn in a straight line from the point where the southern border drawn by the agreement of 1886 touches the eastern bank of the Nyassa to the west as far as the eastern border of the Congo State, but continued in a north-westerly direction to Tanganyka, while the northern border underwent a small southern deviation at Mount Mfumbiro, because here the English claimed the treaties concluded by Stanley in this area for themselves. It should, however, be noted that Germany showed itself to be very obliging towards England in the agreement insofar as the northern border of the German sphere of interest was given the somewhat peculiar direction at Mount Mfumbiro only because Stanley really or only allegedly concluded treaties with indigenous peoples in the area there to the benefit of England, while on the other hand Germany did not believe it could make any claims to the Ugandan landscape north and northwest of Victoria Nyanza, even though Dr. Peters was also reported to have made acquisitions in favor of the German Reich. After the delimitation of the mutual spheres of interest has been established in Articles 1-1V, the two Powers undertake in Articles VIII-X. to apply the provisions of Articles 1 to VI of the Old Treaty on freedom of trade and establishment, the protection of aliens with regard to their persons, property and business, freedom of conscience and worship and the protection of missionaries in all parts of their territory within the free zone, as more precisely defined in Article! of the Congo Act, and to which the provisions of this Treaty are applicable. Since this is essentially only an implementation of the provisions of the Congo Act, there is no need for a more detailed examination of Articles VIII to X of the Treaty of July 1. The agreement concerning Zanzibar contained in Article XI and the cession of the island of Heligoland to the German Emperor contained in Article XII have a substantially different character than the delimitation of the spheres of interest. That in the cession of the island of Heligoland there is a surrender of English sovereign rights in favor of Germany needs no special emphasis But as regards Article XI, which relates to Zanzibar, Great Britain undertakes to use all her influence to bring about a friendly agreement, according to which the Sultan of Zanzibar shall cede to Germany his possessions on the mainland, insofar as they concern the part of the country ceded to the German East African Company, together with the island of Masia, in return for appropriate compensation for the loss of customs revenue caused to him by the cession. On the other hand, Germany undertakes to recognize the protectorate of England over the remaining part of the possessions of the Sultan of Sanstbar, including the islands of Sanstbar and Pemda. The rights granted to the Sultan of Sanstbar over the coastline in question are to be recognized.

Page 202

strip and the island of Masia are, as was expressly recognized in the German-English agreement of 1886, rights of sovereignty, even if they were not and could not be asserted very intensively by the Sultan. Thus, if the Sultan cedes the aforementioned possessions to the German Empire, the latter acquires sovereignty over them. Since England has now endeavored to persuade the Sultan to cede his rights to Germany, the question arises as to when England's obligation will be fulfilled. The answer must be that this obligation is only fulfilled when the Sultan consents to the cession in a legally effective manner, i.e. when England's influence has been successful. Apart from the nature of the matter, this interpretation is probably also supported by the fact that at the end of Article XI it says: "If the cession of the German coast has not yet taken place when Great Britain assumes its protectorate over Zanzibar, His Majesty's Government undertakes to induce the Suttan to make this cession as soon as possible in return for appropriate compensation. If, contrary to expectations, it should not be possible to persuade the Sultan to cede the possessions in question to Germany, the latter will not be obliged to consent to England accepting the protectorate. However, since the agreement of July 1, at least as far as it relates to East Africa, must be regarded as a unified whole, it would in this case have to be regarded as not having come into being at all. In order for the cession of the coastal strip and the island of Masia, as well as the assumption of the protectorate over the rest of the Sultanate of Zanzibar by England, to be legally incontestable, however, the consent of France is also necessary. An agreement was reached between France and England on 10 March 1862, under which the two states mutually undertook to recognize and respect the independence of the Sultan of Zanzibar. The German Empire acceded to this agreement on the basis of the Anglo-German Treaty of 1886. If it is not possible to persuade France to agree to the abolition of the independence of the Sultan of Zanzibar, the agreements of England and Germany with regard to Zanzibar will become unenforceable and the part of the agreement relating to East Africa will also have to be considered null and void in this case. The provisions of the Convention of July 1 relating to Witu and the Somal coast as far as Kismayn are internally connected with the agreements relating to Zanzibar. As has already been pointed out, in Article II Germany renounced its sovereignty over Wetu and the coast up to Kismayn and its claims to territories on the mainland and north of this island. Article XI goes on to state that Germany recognizes the English protectorate over the possessions of the Sultan of Witu and the adjoining territory as far as Kismayn. Germany thus transfers to England its sovereign rights over the stretch of the Somali coast in question and the approximately 25 square miles of Witn ceded by the Sultan of Witn to Denhardt. However, as far as the alleged protectorate over the rest of Wituland described in more detail above is concerned, there can be no question of any transfer of rights to England, since the protectorate does not have to accept the transfer of the protectorate from the protectorate to another state. The obligation of the German Empire is therefore satisfied by the fact that it renounces its protectorate and leaves it to England to persuade the Sultan of Witu to submit to the English protectorate, even if the rights with regard to the coastal section up to Kismayn were of no great significance, since the seizure of possession had only just begun here and it is doubtful whether there was a real protectorate with regard to the Sultanate of Witu. the private rights of members of the Empire in these territories are not affected. On the other hand, the Empire will gain real sovereign rights through the acquisition of the coastal strip previously belonging to the Sultan of Sansidar, including the island of Masia. On the other hand, it is generally not possible to speak of a loss or acquisition of existing sovereign rights with regard to the delimitation of the spheres of interest on both sides. On both the German and English sides, these are essentially only prospects that have been acquired or relinquished. In this respect reference may be made to the relevant earlier remarks, with which, it may be emphasized, the content of Article VII of the Convention of July 1 is entirely consistent. It may be admitted that the hopes of the German colonial circles with regard to the establishment of the German sphere of interest in East Africa have not been fulfilled, that Germany has lost out to England, and that the acquisition of Heligoland cannot be seen as compensation for what was given up in East Africa. An unprejudiced consideration of the content of the Udereinkommen of 1 July must, however, also take into account that for the German Empire in East Africa it was by no means a matter of completely state-organized territories developed and acquired through German cultural work, but merely of providing German colonization activity with a firmly defined area that would be removed from English influence in the future. However, the legal analysis of the treaty is likely to soften the unfavorable verdict on it somewhat.
As with the demarcation of the spheres of interest in East Africa, the same applies to the demarcation in South West Africa. Here, too, it is not a question of regulating borders in relation to territories that are undoubtedly under the sovereignty of the states concerned, but merely the demarcation of spheres of interest, i.e. an agreement in which the opposing parties grant each other a free hand with regard to the occupation of ownerless territories within certain borders. Finally, in Cameroon and Togo, only relatively insignificant border adjustments were in question. Now that the legal content of the agreement has been assessed, it is necessary to examine further what conditions had to be, or still have to be, fulfilled for it to be binding on the German Reich, and in particular whether the consent of the Bundesrat and the Reichstag is required. The answer to this question arises first of all from Article 11 of the Imperial Constitution, which entrusts the Emperor with the international treaties of the Empire and also authorizes him to conclude treaties with foreign states. The consent of the Bundesrat and Reichstag is only required for such treaties if they concern matters which, according to the Imperial Constitution, can only be regulated in the form of law, i.e. with the participation of the Bundesrat and Reichstag. These matters now include all changes to the territory of the Reich, as follows from the description of the same in Article 1 of the Reich Constitution and the law of June 9, 1871, concerning the reunification of Alsace-Lorraine with the German Reich. The incorporation of Heligoland into the territory of the Reich therefore undoubtedly requires an imperial law, whereas all the other agreements contained in the agreement of July 1 could be made by the Emperor alone, without the consent of the Bundesrat or the Reichstag. The protectorates are, however, subject to the sovereignty of the Empire. It follows that they are considered to be part of the Empire under international law, i.e. vis-à-vis other states, and that the Empire is therefore entitled to prevent other states from influencing these territories. It also follows that the Reich was entitled to regulate the constitutional status of the protectorates of its own accord. This regulation was effected by the Imperial Law of April 17, 1886, concerning the legal relations in the protectorates, to the effect that the exercise of the so-called protective power, i.e. all the sovereign rights to which the Empire is entitled over the protectorates, was transferred to the Emperor. However, the protectorates were not declared part of the territory of the Reich by the law of April 17, 1886. Consequently, no consent of the Bundesrat or the Reichstag is required for the cession of parts of the protectorates to foreign states; rather, the Emperor, to whom on the one hand the representation of the Empire under international law and on the other hand the exercise of the sovereign rights to which the Empire is entitled over the protectorates has been transferred alone, is independent in this respect. It is also entirely appropriate that the protectorates have not been declared imperial territory within the meaning of the article of the Imperial Constitution and that the Emperor has therefore been given a free hand to relinquish individual parts of them without first obtaining the consent of the Reichstag and the Bundesrat, since the delimitation of the protectorates is often, in the nature of things, an indeterminate one and not infrequently in its place there is merely a delimitation of the sphere of interest to which the aggravating forms of alienation of state territory cannot be applied. For the same reason, the legislatures of most colonial states have refrained from declaring the colonies to be integral parts of the territory concerned. Just as the Emperor has a free hand in the alienation of territories, or parts thereof, so he is also unrestricted in the acquisition of new protectorates which, as a result of acts of acquisition carried out by the Emperor or in his name, come under the sovereignty or protective rule of the Empire, but without thereby becoming imperial territory. Only insofar as the acquisition of such territories is owed to the imperial class in financial expenditure is the consent of the legislative factors of the empire (Bundesrat and Reichstag) required, since the emperor can only dispose of the funds of the empire insofar as he is authorized to do so by the imperial budget law or a special law. Therefore, if the compensation to be granted to Saltan for the cession of the coast and the island of Masia is to be paid from imperial funds and not from the proceeds of the protectorate itself or from German-East African society, the consent of the legislative factors of the empire (Bandesrat and Reichstag) would also be required. It should be noted, however, that both the incorporation of Heligoland into the territory of the Empire and the payment of compensation to the Sultan of Sansivar were merely measures to implement the Convention of July 1. The agreement itself could be validly concluded by the Emperor alone. The consent of the Reichstag and the Bundesrat is not required. Accordingly, the Reichstag will only be concerned with conventions to the extent that the two enforcement measures are in question. It also follows from this that the Reichstag will not be in a position to exert pressure on the English Government to obtain more favorable conditions by refusing to approve the treaty, quite apart from the fact that it would be appropriate to expose the Imperial Government to England in this way. This article is followed by a number of letters which also deal with constitutional considerations regarding the German-English agreement.

The Witn area and the Anglo-German treaty. It is generally assumed that the Anglo-German Treaty transferred all German possessions north of the Tana to England. However, this does not appear to be correct at all. On the contrary, an albeit small part of the territory north of the mouth of the Tana remained German property, since it was not ceded by the Anglo-German treaty and could not have been ceded by this treaty due to the special legal situation of this part of the territory. The German acquisitions between Tana and Juba were made up of various components. By treaty of April 8, 1885, Sultan Achmed von Witn had ceded a territory of 25 square miles with all the private rights to which he was entitled to Klemens Denhardt, who in turn ceded it to the Witngesellschaft, the legal successor of which is currently the Dentsch-East Afritan Company. In addition, the protectorate over the Witn Sultanate and the protectorate over the coast between Witn and Kismaju were taken over from Germany. The latter two territories were undoubtedly transferred to England by the German-English treaty, but not the first-mentioned territory of the Witn Company, as the German Empire had not yet acquired any right of disposal over it. The Sultan of Witn had ceded this territory, which will be referred to as that of the Witn Company in the following, with all sovereign rights, before a German protectorate was established over the Sultanate of Witn, as the protectorate was only transferred on May 27, 1885. This protectorate could therefore only extend to the territories that still belonged to the Sultan of Witu at the time. The German protectorate therefore did not cover the territory of the Witngesellschaft, but Kiemens Denhardt, later the Witugesellschaft and finally the Deutsch=ostafrikanische Gesellschaft were completely independent. The German Reich could only have acquired sovereignty under international law over the territory of the Witu Society by taking over the protectorate at the request of the current sovereign. However, this did not happen. In particular, it is known that the Witugesellschaft never received an imperial charter of protection for its territory. Therefore, this territory never became a legal possession of the German Empire. It is a part of the country that is still under the unrestricted sovereignty of the German East African Society. The fact that companies can acquire and exercise sovereign rights independently is no longer doubtful in today's international law and was recognized by England itself years ago with regard to the North Berne Company. However, the German Empire was not able to cede more rights through the treaty with England than it possessed itself. In particular, therefore, the idea of the Witngesellschaft was not transferred to England. The Deutsch=ostafrikanische Gesellschaft is completely sovereign here, and England could only acquire sovereignty on the basis of a special treaty with the Deutsch=ostafrikanische Gesellschaft as sovereign of the territory of the former Witngesellschaft. Konrad Bornhak. Another legal member of our society finds another ambiguity in the German-English treaty in the fact that in the treaty in question the English only pledge their good offices to persuade the Sultan of Zanzibar to cede the coastal strip. They neither cede such a coastal strip themselves, nor do they guarantee any success for their friendly efforts, nor could they do either one or the other, since they do not, or at least not yet, have the Sultan's possessions at their disposal. The author writes: "But what will happen if the Sultan does not listen to the friendly ideas of the English? If he, perhaps suspecting that this is not at all disagreeable to his protectors, refuses to cede the coastal strip or nothing else, or if - because of the impression it makes - he concedes it in principle, but fails to reach an agreement with us on the more detailed conditions - the amount of compensation, etc. - and finally breaks off negotiations, must we then accept all the concessions to the English - the abandonment of Witu, etc.? etc. - and, renouncing acquired territories and further acquisitions, be content with an African idea without a coast, exposed to the ridicule of other peoples over the happy trickery of the Germans. If the English could not guarantee the cession of the coastal strip, the achievement of this goal could nevertheless be made a precondition for the validity of the entire treaty. Perhaps the energy of English intercession with the Sultan would not have suffered as a result. Thus the letter from our member. We cannot fully share the concerns expressed above (ctr. the article by Prof. v. Stengel). In view of the actual state of affairs on the coast, we cannot believe that the English will fail to exert the necessary pressure on their protégé, and we also believe that it is in keeping with the intention of the German-English treaty that the Germans would be released from their obligations if the relevant part of the treaty remains unfulfilled. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that it would have been better if it had been expressly stated that the entire, coherent treaty would only become effective with the cession of the coastal strip. In our opinion, Germany has rights to this coastal strip which are acquired completely independently of the consent of the Sultan and the support of England. Possession of the coastal strip is in German hands and there is therefore no lack of means to exert pressure on the Sultan of Zanzibar. Contrary to his expressly assumed obligations, the Sultan of Zanzibar has not provided the German East African Company with possession and undisturbed exploitation of the coastal strip. This had to be conquered with German weapons, either because the Sultan had lost control of those territories or because the natives obeyed him and the whispers of his agents only too well. In the opinion of knowledgeable experts on the situation there and according to the testimony of Bushiri, given before his death, the latter was the case, and the Sultan was the hidden head of the uprising. In the same case, the English would have made little fuss, abolished the Sultan and declared the whole Sultanate to be good prey for a large one. We Germans ask the German newspaper to speak - "Where is the evidence for Buschiris, as if every testimony had to be followed by further assertions, a further testimony for the credibility of the former - we will bear the costs of the pacification, pay the Sultan a handsome compensation, the amount of which is not yet certain, and ask the English to put in a good word for us in order to obtain what belongs to no one more than to us. In order not to impose too much on their disinterestedness, we leave the English the best part of the entire empire of our opponent, the Sultan, a new Heligoland 3000 times the size of the new African German Empire, and are pleased that we are to receive the swampy, inaccessible Masia on the side. The northwest of German East Africa. According to the German-English agreement, as is well known, the border of the spheres of influence west of Victoria Nyanza does not run in a straight line, does not continue at the first parallel of southern latitude until it meets the territory of the Congo State, but swings to the south at a mountain to which the name Msumbiro is given, bypasses this mountain and continues from its western side to 1 degree south latitude. In this way, the Mfumbiro is excluded from belonging to the German sphere and is included in the British-African territory. The exact location of this mountain is not known. From the heights of Karagwe, Speke and Grant - i.e. Englishmen - had first seen the peaks (some bold sky-scraping cones) of the "Mjumbiro", as the natives called it, lying in the far distance, and Speke had assumed it to be part of the Mountains of the Moon, the Mountais of the Noon, which he has drawn south of the "Luta Nsige" on the map of his travel work; Speke has a river, the source of the Rils, flowing down into this lake from those mountains. The Mfumbiro was seen a second time by an American and native Englishman, namely by Stanley, when on his first crossing of Africa he also looked westwards from the elevations around Lake Windermere; three pointed cones stood out on the horizon to the northwest, the distance of which was highly uncertain, may have been some 80 to even 100 kilometers, and whose height could therefore only be estimated at perhaps 10,000 English feet (3,050 m), if one even ventured to make an estimate. No one else has seen Mount Mfumbiro, whether from a more or less distant observation point; Stanley's most recent Emin="Liberation" expedition took a route that was too far north for this purpose. It is therefore not only the geographical position of the Mjumbiro that is uncertain, we do not even know its hydrographic position and whether it drains into Lake Tanganyika or Lake Victoria or Lake Albert Edward or even the Congo, or into one or more of these waters. According to Stanley's inquiries, a river Mworongo flows from the mountain southwards to Lake Alexandra, which is connected to Lake Victoria Nyanza by the Kagera or Alexandra Nile. It seems doubtful whether we are dealing with an isolated mountain or a mountain range, a complex of mountains. In short, so little is known about the Mfumbiro that even the right of discovery in relation to it cannot say much, although, if one takes it seriously, it must be credited to the English. Of course, England did not rely on any rights of discovery when it claimed and coveted the Mfumbiro for itself. Under such circumstances, however, it was bound to cause surprise, it was bound to assume, quite unfoundedly, that for the sake of such an unknown rocky outcrop the straight boundary line had changed.

 should be at liberty to deviate at all. As it is impossible to suppose that mere caprice and arbitrariness induced the English government to insert a clause of this kind in the treaty, the question is, what views may have guided it, and what reasons may have determined it. From the Government, however, from Sir Percy Anderson, one must go back to Stanley, whose advice the English negotiators naturally did not disregard, and whose opinion and experience they made use of. So if Stanley suggested the incorporation of Mfumbiro into the British possessions, he must have been influenced by considerations of the future value of the district. In Stanley's work "In Darkest Africa", the Msumbiro is not mentioned at all; on the accompanying maps, this area is described as terra incognita; the Albert Edward Nyanza is enclosed on the same maps by pergolas all around, which are cut through in the south by a "river from Rwanda, which comes from the direction of Mount Mfumbiro; indeed, the latter is strangely but tellingly still depicted as German and is not separated from the German lands surrounding it to the south by any other coloring. Stanley cannot have entered into any special treaties with the natives of this point so remote from his route. In the letters published by Keltie, the traveler occasionally remarked that he had supplemented and modified his earlier inquiries about Rwanda and its neighboring areas with some interesting new information; however, the maps of "Darkest Africa" will have presented all his material, as there was no longer any reason to hold back. A justification of Stauley's behavior and that of the English in general with regard to the agreements with Germany has not been published, the English government will perhaps not imitate the example of the Germans in giving an open motivation for their actions in defending their claims, or not as soon as possible, "Darkest Africa" leaves many, especially political, mysteries unsolved and does not allow a look behind the scenes, and thus we are dependent on conclusions from the known to the unknown in the question of why the Msumbiroberg also became English. First of all, the area between the west coast of the Victorian Nyansa, the northern tip of Tanganyika and Lake Albert Edward promises to become important in the future as a transit area; Karagwe dominates the caravan routes to Unyoro and Uganda, and the landscapes between Nyangwe and the Stanley Falls on the Upper Congo open up to the west. Within this area is a network of lakes and rivers, and the importance attached to this region by the British has found expression in the freedom granted to them by the treaty to lay a road through here from Lake Victoria to Lake Tanganyika. The outermost sources of the western branch of the Rile extend into these regions; according to Stanley's treaty, which is printed (under the title Geographical Results of the Emin Pasha Relief Expedition) in the Procoedings, June 1890, the Albert sources of the Nile extend to about 1° 10 fdl. br. The mouth and perhaps part of the middle course of the Kagera or Alexandra=Ril have become English, the rest of the course of this river German. The acquisition of these lands to the west of the Great Nyanza is all the more to be regarded as an achievement for Germany as they are described by English travelers as fertile. There was certainly no great willingness to recognize Germany as master there; England sought to secure as much as possible of the Nile Strait, which begins around Lake Albert Edward. If this entire extreme western corner could not become British, at least a fraction of it could; how large it would be is doubtful, as it cannot be determined how far the Mfumbiro extends, especially to the south and west: in any case, the area around the mountain is characterized by its central location between the tributaries of the Albert Edward, the Tanganyika, the Congo and the Victoria Nyanza. Speke already considered the elevation he saw to be the major turning point of the Central African watershed. This is one reason why the mountain could not appear undesirable. The most striking feature of Central Africa is the spread of plateaus and tablelands, against which mountain ranges and massifs recede into the background. High mountains, of volcanic origin, occur only sporadically; of the two eastern mountain giants in the range that forms the actual backbone of the African mainland, Kenya and Kilimanjaro, the latter has fallen to Germany. It will be remembered that in one of his speeches Stanley expressed his sincere anger at the Teutonic presumption to annex Africa's loftiest mountain peak outright. As if the modest Germans were entitled to such a right! After all, Johnston had praised the fertile slopes of Kilimanjaro, extolled the healthy climate, which commended itself even to European settlers, and emphasized how the terraced zones of woodland and grassland rising above each other on the mountain enabled various types of cultivation, hunting and cattle breeding. And how free and secure are the mountain dwellers, whose island-like dwellings give them a superiority over the inhabitants of the lowlands and plains in war, and who possess natural fortresses in their dominating heights; sometimes they are therefore distinguished from their neighboring peoples by intelligence and race. Kilimanjaro, like the Konde and Livingstone mountains in the north and north-east of Nyassa, which have now become definitively German, and like Mount Cameroon in West Africa, will also be suitable for the construction of health stations and sanatoriums, similar to those which the Himalayas offer the East Indians; mountains therefore have an outstanding value in Jnner Africa in various respects. Now we Germans, in the division of the dark part of the world, have fallen short of what we have in advance in the west of the Victoria Nyanza: not only the Gordon Bennett or Gambaragara, whose king was also the ruler of the land of Usongora, as well as the Cloud King Ruwensori, but also the Msumbiro, which, when it actually reaches 10,000 feet, stands to the side of those, became British, and thus, however, a certain harmony was restored in this dissonance of border demarcation, in that, just as the border, deviating from the straight line, moves around the northern foot of Kilimanjaro, it winds around the southern foot of the Mfumbiro It is curious how little territory attributed to British influence the last Stanley expedition traversed; It first left the sphere of the Congo State in the vicinity of Kavalli at Lake Albert, then passed the foot of the Ruwensori, marched through Ankori and entered the German sphere of interest again at the Kagera River at one degree south latitude. On this relatively short route, Stanley took the opportunity to conclude treaties with the indigenous tribes (which were not made public until later). Scanty information about this can be found in the book "In Darkest Africa": "We were kindly received and welcomed in the name of King Antari (of Ankori)." "We had not been in Ankori long when we had also thoroughly recognized the situation: Ankori was the property of the king. The people we would have to deal with were only the governors called Wakungu, and the king, his mother and so on. Ankori was a copy of Uganda." (German edition II. pp. 328, 329 "Ankori is your country in the future" (pp. 331, 332). "In any case, I was publicly recognized (as a result of blood brotherhood with the heir to the throne) as Antari's son and henceforth had permission to roam the territory of Ankori at will and the right to settle . .. Moreover, the prince swore in the name of his father that in future all white men who wished to come to Ankori must have a recommendation from me . . . (S. 345). The extent of African landscapes is known, as Ratzel in particular has pointed out, to be very fluctuating, uncertain and changeable; just as little as Ugogo and Uniamwest can Ankori be defined with sharp, fixed boundaries. But Ankori certainly lies in its full extent north of the first degree of southern latitude. So in which country does the Msumbiroberg lie? Not in Ankori, which was persuaded by Stanley, partly out of fear (II. p. 332), to show its subservience. From "Darkest Africa" (II. p. 339) we learn: "South-southwest of the town of Rjamatoso (at the northern foot of the Ruampara range) lies Mpororo, which was attacked and occupied by Antari a few years ago; after several bloody clashes, the population and its king became tributaries to Antari. Rwanda begins on a line drawn to the west-fouthwest and is ruled by King Kigeri, but not much more information can be obtained about the country than that it is said to be large and to extend as far as from Njamatoso to Kafurro." p. 314: "Rwanda is a large country." This solves the riddle that Mpororo was regarded by the English as belonging to Ankori (although the above-mentioned place Njamakoso, where Stanley was camped, had itself been "very recently" conquered by Antari, II. p. 341), and that the Mfumbiro was indicated by them as the southernmost end of Mpororo. But two things are conspicuous: firstly, that Mpororo thus becomes a country of considerable extent, far greater than was previously assumed. Secondly, as a further consequence, the position of the mighty empire of Rwanda shifted. The boundaries of this landscape (cf. my paper: Das Rilquellgebiet, Easter 1890, p. 58) are the Alexandranil to the east and the watershed of the Congo to the west; it is said to extend in part to the south-western shore of the Albert Edward, but otherwise only to the vicinity of this lake, and also borders on the Alexandra=Nyanza (see also Keltie,

Page 205

Stanley's letters p. 106, and In Darkest Africa II p. 314, 323). It is now remarkable that, according to Speke's acknowledgedly very reliable inquiries, which he had made in Karagwe, the Mjumbiro is located in Rwanda! (see Journal of the discovery of the source of the Nile by J. II. Speke 213, 214). In 1876, the now suddenly so powerful King Antari of Ankori, like Karaqwe rc., paid tribute to the King of Uganda (Im dunkelsten Afrika 11 pp. 327, 368), but Rwanda has always remained completely independent. And if we now take a look at the latest maps, such as the two maps attached to "Darkest Africa", we find that the cartographers overcame the difficulty of uniting the location of the two landscapes of Mpororo and Rwanda by moving Rwanda more to the west; the name Rwanda is written in such a way that it falls entirely within the boundaries of the Congo state!") If anyone should think that the matter itself is indifferent and worthless in view of the practical importance of the question, which for the time being is still far away, it must be countered that the English, masters in colonial matters, are accustomed to taking into account from the outset such apparently minor details, which in reality are sometimes very important afterwards. No one knows whether the "Mfumbiro" is a mountain or a mountain range, a mountain range and of what size this mountain range may be, whether this name may designate the entire mountain range or only a part of it; It is to be feared, however, that this extreme north-western corner may be completely lost, whereby we hope that the English will not attempt to force a wedge between the Congo State and German East Africa, which would extend from Lake Albert Edward to the northern tip of Tanganyika via "Rwanda". Incidentally, we note that the above-mentioned maps bear the indication "Mt. Mfumbiro "*). If Stanley's or the English claims to the Mfumbiro district had such dubious and weak justification, and if the British were nevertheless unwilling to give up even one iota, it is all the more regrettable that the other party was not able to assert its principle, which was far more logical and well-motivated and which eliminated all disputes forever: to determine the border solely by latitude. The British presented the alternative: either Stauley's treaties apply, in which case Mpororo and the Mfumbiroberg are also British, or they do not apply at all, in which case of course we cannot come to an agreement; Germany agreed. The concession shown by the Germans to the English during the treaty negotiations is also evident in this case; the Mfumbiro became English not because the English could say: we have already actually taken it and must therefore insist on its transfer to us when discussing the distribution of the territories (prendre d'abord, discuter ensuite), but because with the greatest liberality the German side made the most willing, conciliatory concession of the validity of all Stanley's agreements without subjecting them to severe criticism. How little, however, this German compliance was appreciated by a section of the English press even after the treaty was concluded, is again shown by recent reports, for example when the Times speaks of depredations, devastations of German agents (Peters), whereas Stanley was also only a British agent who, however, worked with greater means and in a superior style, as a great entrepreneur. E. Wiechmann - Ludwigslust. The Northwest German Trade and Industry Exhibition in Bremen. By Dr. M. Lindemann. In No. 12 of the "Deutsche Kolonialzeitung" (from June 7) you have a first overview of our beautiful industry=Aus1) On the map to Stanley's. "Through the Dark Part of the World" is the Mfumbiro in Rwanda, also on sect. 13 of Ravenstein's vices Equatorial Afrira, only the latter, northern foothills extend to Mpororo. Stanley did not enter Mpororo and did not come to Rwanda at all. It is internally unlikely that Mpororo would be attacked and completely subjugated by Ankori in the north, for example, while at the same time expanding southwards against an even more powerful neighbor. However, Stanley's treaties could not have been valid as a title of possession for a mountain in Rwanda. The map accompanying Stanley's "Through the Dark Part of the World", on the other hand, read "Ufumbiro 10t8.", i.e. mountains. In the English-German treaty it says Monnt Mfumbiro and continues: il that mountain &; so this is the wording.
The English-German treaty gives an overview of the exhibition and especially of the rich trade exhibition united in a separate hall. In proper appreciation of the importance of this section of the exhibition for our colonial affairs, and in accordance with the editors' wishes, we shall now provide some information on individual branches and sections of this exhibition that are of particular interest to the colonial economy. First and foremost is tobacco, Bremen's most important trade item, in which it has become a world market. The tobacco exhibition, which was united in a separate hall, was not yet finished at the time your first article was published. All the more reason, and in view of the importance that tobacco growing will hopefully also gain in our colonial countries in the course of time, to focus first of all on this tobacco exhibition, which is so rarely rich and consists of 565 samples. The tobacco exhibition occupies a special extension adjoining the middle hall opposite the entrance. This is tastefully decorated with friezes composed of palm fronds and tobacco leaves. The exhibition itself is extremely rich. It consists primarily of a large number of hand samples, which are arranged in four cabinets together with their names. In each corner of the hall there is a group containing the usual original packages, as: Barrels, bales (of linen), serons, boxes (of oxhide or raffia), baskets, etc. are on display. Above these stacks runs a wide frieze in which a number of colorful paintings from the studio of Mr. Arthur Fitger are placed. These depict cities and regions that play a particularly important role in the tobacco trade. As we enter the hall, there is a depiction of the city of Havana immediately to the left. This is followed on the right by pictures of Portorico, Bahia, Louisville (warehouse and auction hall), Richmond, Baranquilla, Rio de Janeiro, Sumatra and New Orleans. In terms of imports from the countries of origin of tobacco, America is in first place. Of the total import of tobacco in Bremen in 1889, which amounted to 47,261,000 marks in value, America accounted for 33,537,000 marks, namely 12,054,000 marks from the United States, 8,878,000 from the West Indies and 12,081,000 marks from South America. Tobacco was imported from Asia in 1889, mostly from Sumatra, for 13,328,000 marks, while imports of European tobacco - German, Hungarian and Turkish - were insignificant. The first cabinet is devoted exclusively to North American cask tobacco, including primarily Kentucky smoke and cigar tobacco, as well as stems, a total of 50 varieties, which are of course only distinguishable to the layman if the coloring of the leaf is particularly striking, e.g. reddish or bright yellow. Virginia tobacco appears in 36 assortments, Ohio and Maryland in 10 each. A curiosity are samples of old Ohio tobacco from the vintages 1848, 1866 and 1871, which show the durability of this tobacco. The second cabinet is dedicated to West Indian, Central and South American tobacco arriving in serons (mats), packs, bales and baskets. The Mexican, Havanese, other Cuban, St. Domingo, Venezuelan and Brazilian tobaccos appear in numerous assortments, depending on their use as wrapper, binder or filler. The once so famous Amdala tobacco is now pretty much a thing of the past. We have already mentioned the imported cigars from Central and South America above. It may be interesting to note that the tobacco production of the island of Cuba, which is largely for its own consumption, now amounts to about 4-500,000 bales. Of this, 3= to 400000 bales are produced in the Havana districts proper and 100000 in the other tobacco-growing districts of the island. Bremen's imports of tobacco of all varieties from Cuba have risen from 30,000 to 54,000 bales in recent years. The third cabinet shows us the astatic tobaccos which arrive here in packs, serons and bales. The famous tobacco plantations of East Sumatra supply by far the largest quantity in terms of value, namely 11,510,000 marks, while the import of tobacco from Java is worth 1,396,000 marks and the other East Indian varieties 376,000 marks. It is well known, and often described in letters and articles in the Kolonialzeitung,*) that tobacco cultivation, begun on the alluvial land of East Sumatra at the beginning of the 1960s, has proved to be one of the most successful colonial ventures of the Dutch. Admittedly, this culture is a very extensive one, in that after burning down the forest it is usually only sown and harvested once for a longer period of time, but in the meantime a new virgin forest area *) See Deutsche Kol. Zig. vol. 2, p. 417 and fl. and neue Folge 1. Jahrg. 1888, p. 12 and f.

Page 206

 is being tackled. After all, production in East Sumatra is still growing steadily. The tobacco-growing companies, of which a whole series of new ones have been established in recent years, not only with Dutch, but also with German, English, Swiss and French capital, are doing excellent business and paying high dividends. The actual monopoly which the Dutch used to exercise by concentrating the bulk sale of East Asian raw tobacco in Amsterdam has fortunately been broken in recent years. With the help of our new imperial mail steamer line, considerable quantities of Sumatra tobacco were brought directly to Bremen; these were reinforced by imports of raw tobaccos from northern (British) Borneo, where a German tobacco company, including an important Bremen company, has established itself. It seems that tobacco in northern Borneo is also acquiring those excellent qualities (fineness of leaf and good color) which make it so highly valued even in America. Holland still remains the main market for Sumatran tobacco: in 1889, 169012 packets*) Sumatra was sold there in 1889, along with 171,971 packets of Java tobacco. The fourth cabinet of the tobacco exhibition presents us with all kinds of curiosities and less sought-after varieties from Asian and European Turkey, Greece, East Africa, Fernando=Po, the Canary Islands, Transvaal, Cameroon, Zanzibar, New Guinea and Australia; The fact that the samples of New Guinea tobacco have met with the approval of local experts is particularly noteworthy, as it is encouraging for the future development of tobacco growing in Kaiser=Wilhelmsland. Recently, this tobacco exhibition was enriched by a fifth cabinet, made of American walnut wood, which was a gift from C. C. Mengel's wood wholesaler in Lonisville to the local leaf tobacco exchange, filled by the latter with a complete collection of samples of all Kentucky tobacco varieties and donated to the Bremen exhibition. A second raw material that has become highly significant for Bremen's trade is rice. It was not until the 1950s that the import of rice from the Far East became of rapidly growing importance for Bremen. Initially, the transportation of the raw, unhulled rice to Europe was arranged by sailing ships, but recently large steamers specially constructed for the voyage have been put into service. The beautiful model of the new large rice steamer "Helene Rickmers" on display gives us a clear picture of how and in what quantities the rice is brought from the ports of the Far East to Europe by means of such steamers. (We insert here that the Rickmers company is one of the most important rice importers in Bremen, and at the same time has been involved in the large rice starch mills built with Bremen capital in Salzuflen and Münden for a number of years). The model is open on one long side to illustrate the interior fittings. The "Helene Rickmers" is 97.5 m long, 13 m wide, has a draught of 8.3 m, an engine of 1350 indexed horsepower and a load capacity of 3950 tons - 48840 sacks of rice. Such a load is processed by the local rice husking mills of the Rielsen brothers in 4 to 5 days. The scope of the local rice business has already been described in the article in No. 12 of this newspaper, page 150. Likewise, the importance of this important lighting material for Bremen was already emphasized at that time by means of the exemplarily arranged exhibition group of petroleum, citing the relevant figures of the import values. Probably no other exhibition has shown the extraction and treatment of petroleum up to its consumption as vividly as this one by means of models and photographs; we see models of the drilling and pumping stations, the vats for holding the crude petroleum, the pipes and the cistern cars for transporting the crude petroleum to the refineries, the so-called tank steamers, in which the petroleum is transported in large iron containers that fill the holds of the ships. One such steamer can carry 23,900 barrels of petroleum. The way in which the petroleum is handled after it arrives in the European port is also illustrated by a series of models. These include the large iron cisterns, surrounded by an earth wall to protect against the risk of fire, which hold around 10,000 barrels of petroleum. The crude petroleum is obtained directly from America by a local refinery built in 1865, whereas otherwise only refined petroleum, also from the United States, is imported here. It is known that petroleum is still found in a number of overseas territories and is also partially exploited, namely in Canada, Bolivia, Burma, China, Japan, *) 1 bale or pack weighs 70-80 1g.
Persia, Egypt, Australia and New Zealand. The petroleum production of Russia (on the Apse Caspian peninsula) has become of greater commercial importance, which, as it seems, offers a head start to the petroleum production almost monopolized in America by the Standard Oil Co. in various countries, e.g. already in British India Further important raw materials of Bremen imports are cotton, wool. indigo and jute. The cotton group in the trade exhibition is arranged by the Bremen Cotton Exchange. A large picture on the back wall shows a cotton field in the American southern states, the workers are busy harvesting the cotton, which, packed into huge bales, is picked up by one of the big Missisippi steamers for transportation to the seaport. A collection of samples shows us the different types of East Indian, American and Egyptian cotton. The models of cotton presses and cotton cleaning machines enhance the instructive character of this group; a memorandum, which is distributed to everyone, informs about the organization and purposes of the Bremen Cotton Exchange, to which not only the local importers, but also a number of important domestic cotton industrialists belong. Incidentally, a large cotton spinning mill has been established on the Lower Weser for a number of years with Bremen capital, namely at Grohn near Vegesack, which demonstrates its products in the main hall. The main countries importing raw wool for Bremen last year were Argentina and Uruguay with an import value of 36,430,000 marks, the Cape Colony with 107,788,000 marks and Australia with 7,631,000 marks. Next to London, Antwerp and Bremen are the most important wool markets on the European continent. In addition to the above-mentioned direct imports from the countries of origin, Bremen purchased 14,339,000 marks worth of wool from the Great British market in 1889. A number of years ago, at a time when Bremen was not yet part of the German customs territory, large factories were set up in the surrounding area through Bremen capital, namely a worsted spinning and weaving mill in Delmenhorft and two laundries in Vegesack, one of which is also connected to a large-scale contract combing plant. Some of the raw wool appears in a special exhibition, which is also very well equipped with paintings from the three main areas of non-European sheep farming: the La States, the Cape Colony and Australia. The southern end of the lower floor of the trading hall is entirely devoted to this interesting wool exhibition, in which the various ways of packing the wool are also presented to us in 97 original bales, representing a value of many thousands of marks. The wool then appears in various geographically organized groups, especially in the sections dedicated to the La Plata countries. Here we find the models of a large estancia owned by a large trading company in Bremen and Buenos Aires. Another part of the Argentine section contains a collection of wool samples among many other products of the Argentine Republic under a large landscape picture illustrating the scenery of the Cordillera and the Pampas. This collection, sent by the Argentine government, is to remain with the local Chamber of Commerce, but the donation is linked to the wish that this collection should be exhibited here permanently. This rekindles an idea that had already been expressed at smaller exhibitions of this kind in 1865 and 1874, but was not realized at that time. This time the conviction seems to be general and lively, so that it is to be hoped that this idea, the establishment of a trade museum in Bremen, will finally be realized after the end of the exhibition. Of course, considerable funds are required; a building of its own must be erected, an administration set up, not inconsiderable funds must be secured for the permanent preservation, increase and from time to time renewal of the objects to be exhibited. The projected trade museum must be taken over and managed by the state or the Chamber of Commerce if it is to become something proper. It remains to be seen whether the voluntary contributions of the merchants alone can provide the necessary funds for the establishment and maintenance of the museum. The city already has a natural science and ethnographic museum under the direction of a naturalist as a civil servant, which was donated to it a number of years ago by the local museum association with a considerable sum of money. The numerous ethnographic objects contained in the trade exhibition could provide an opportunity to combine the new museum with the current municipal museum. After all

Page 207

the latter's inconveniently located premises had long since become too cramped for the ever-growing collection. In its introductory article, the "Kolonial=Zeitung" already briefly mentioned the indigo exhibition and the models of indigo preparation. As is well known, the indigo plant was introduced from its native India to various tropical countries, such as Guatemala and Colombia. Bremen imported four million marks worth of indigo last year and exported just as much. In view of the importance that indigo still has as a dyeing material for our large-scale industry, despite the aniline dyes, it may be of interest to provide a more detailed description of indigo production, as practiced in Colombia, for example, and also shown in a model in this section. "The indigo seed - about 6 to 10 grains together - is planted in rows at short intervals; the plant, which develops like a bush, is cut off just above the root about 3 months after it has flowered, thrown into a basin and filled with water. After about 12 hours, the water is covered with a blue-colored skin and rising air bubbles indicate that the water has removed the color from the plants. The water is now drained into a basin below and set in motion by means of a water-powered agitator. The water absorbs oxygen from the air and turns a dark blue-green color. After about 3 hours, the water is tested for its color content with lime water; if small color globules sink to the bottom, the time has come to precipitate the color particles in the lower basin by adding lime water. After two hours, the Jndigo settles as a sludge-like mass at the bottom of the basin and the now yellowish-green water above it must be carefully drained. The sludge is then placed in a third lower basin, which is equipped with a filter; after the mass has drained off there, it is transferred to the adjacent box, which also serves as a filter, and pressed out strongly under a lever press. From there the mass is spread on a wooden base and cut into cubes with string, which lose the last of their moisture in the drying room and then go into the packing room. (The end follows). News from the company. The administration of the Northwest German Trade and Industry Exhibition in Bremen has sent a letter to the heads of the departments inviting the members of our society to visit the exhibition. The President, Prince Hohenlohe-Langenburg, has warmly recommended this invitation, which is associated with many advantages and facilities for our members, to the boards of the departments for their consideration. The following passage from the President's letter to the departmental boards, which expresses the value of the trade exhibition in particular, is of particular interest to colonial friends: "Now that all assessments of the Bremen exhibition have unanimously recognized its unsurpassed diversity, magnificence and beauty, we can only warmly support the administration's invitation to our members. A very special attraction in the midst of the rich abundance of interesting and instructive collections of industrial and commercial products is the trade exhibition, in addition to the types of overseas change and activity depicted in vivid pictures. Of the 70 different buildings belonging to the exhibition, which together occupy a building area of 40,000 square meters on the 375,000 square meter fairground, the trade exhibition building covers 2,800 square meters. In this large building, which is characterized by rich architectural decoration, a magnificent façade with a long front decorated in the central part and on the sides by decorative towers, overseas trade is presented in an almost surprising completeness and beauty. Each country forms a special section, in which the products on display are advantageously framed by rich decorative ornamentation appropriate to the country in question. But the way in which the products of the individual countries, their extraction, processing and utilization are illustrated is truly admirable and worthy of the highest praise. Here one sees and is most pleasantly touched by the fact that loving care has been taken for the cause, not just the purpose of the exhibition. The entire process of extraction and utilization of all the main products, such as cotton, cassee, tea, petroleum, etc., is presented to us in a step-by-step sequence with meticulous precision. We see the cotton planters in the field, planting the young seedlings or picking the ripe fruit from the bushes, we are led into the sorting and spinning hall of the natives, where men and women are busy sorting and spinning the wool. The natives' loom is set up and apparently in operation, while elsewhere workers, always dressed in their respective national costumes, are pressing whole mountains of loose cotton into a solid bale for shipment, which is to be supplied to the industrial centers through the mediation of Europe's seed trade. In this and similar articles, each country worthy of consideration for overseas trade has found a peculiar and varied representation, so that a visit to this very hall is eminently suitable for conveying a clear view of the size and importance of the overseas trade life of the peoples. In addition to providing instruction, the visit also offers a completely new and unique pleasure, since not only the arrangement as a whole creates a pleasant impression, but each individual collection is characterized by cleanliness and tasteful composition, and the models and group pictures mostly have future artistic value." Friends of the promotion of overseas trade are particularly recommended to visit the trade exhibition in Bremen. Small announcements. - (East Africa.) According to a telegram sent here from Suez, Dr. Peters planned to arrive in Naples, "Grand Hotel", on August 9. - According to the Hamburg News from Zanzibar, the following changes are taking place in the Wissmann troop: Captain Römer and Paymaster Streim are leaving the service. Captain Count Pfeil has left for Bombay to charter a larger steamer. The "Harmonie" is returned to Cologne on the high seas as being unserviceable. On board the "Harmonie" is deck officer Lange, representing the commissariat, and Lieutenant Burger, who delivers a considerable number of Sudanese who have become unfit for service to Agppten. A telegram dated Zanzibar, July 31, confirms in a gratifying manner that there is complete peace in German East Africa. The telegram says: The Deputy Reich Commissioner Dr. Schmidt returned to Zanzibar today from his expedition against Mahenge. The Masiti have escaped from him, and the last of the rebellious chiefs, Pangire, has submitted. The pacification of the Northern Province up to Rusidji has now also been completed and there is complete peace. - Lieutenant Sigl, who is accompanying the trader Stokes, who left for the north at the beginning of July, with a detachment of the protection force, has received the order to advance to Tabora, occupy the town and establish a fortified station there, which he will initially occupy with his men. As the crow flies, Tabora is almost exactly 700 km from Bagamoyo; in the middle between it and the coast, about 300 km inland, lies the Germans' first fortified station, Mpwapwa. Furthermore, the distance from Tabora to Udschidschi on the Tanganvka is only about 300 hm. According to the Times, Emin Pasha is said to have successfully fought heavy battles with the Maasais in Ugogo and captured 1200 head of cattle. - On August 1, the Sultan of Sanstbar issued a decree concerning slavery. According to this decree, the regulations on slavery that existed before the conclusion of the Anglo-German agreement remain in force. The sale or exchange of slaves is prohibited and the keeping of slave depots is forbidden under severe penalty. On the death of a slave owner, his slaves become the property of his legitimate children and are only granted freedom in the event that there are no legitimate descendants. Cruel treatment of slaves is punished by confiscation. In the case of marriages between Arabs and British subjects, the slaves of the Arab will become free. Finally, in future slaves can buy their freedom and acquire the rights of free subjects. - The German-East African Company had the first German-colonial coin, a pesa, minted. The outer circle on one face reads: Deutsch=ostafrikanische Gesellschaft 1890 The inner circle is formed by the German imperial eagle. The other face has a lordeer wreath and in the center an inscription in Arabic language and script which reads: Die deutsche Gesellschaft. One million coins have been minted to date. One rupee is worth 66 of this coin, which currently costs between 1.60 and 1.70 marks. A silver coin is currently being minted. - (The German-English agreement) will still lead to some disputes with England and the Sultan regarding the customs treaty and the compensation for ceding the coastal strip to the latter. As far as the customs treaty is concerned, Germany's obligation to apply the free trade provisions of the Berlin Act extends to the entire German sphere of interest in East Africa, with the exception of a 10-mile-deep strip of coastal territory that still belongs to Zanzibar. There is no compulsion to make changes to the customs regime after the coastal strip has been taken over, but new arrangements will probably be made with regard to customs duties, as have already been envisaged by the German East African and British East African companies. The compensation demanded by the Sultan is said to be so high that it is quite unacceptable and it will perhaps take long negotiations to reach a result here. There are differences of opinion about the greater or lesser obligation of England regarding assistance in determining a reasonable amount of compensation and the retroactive effect on the treaty if an agreement is not reached. However, as we are in possession of the coffers, our position here is relatively favorable.

- (South West Africa.) The Reichskommissar Dr. Göring issued a decree from Usap on April 1, according to which the decree of April 19, 1886, according to which the native chiefs in the German protectorate may only legally grant mining concessions with the permission of the Reichskommissar, is extended to the German sphere of interest. (Togogediet.) The number of whites living in the German Togo territory is currently 85, including 28 Germans, 1 Englishman and 1 Swiss and 5 Frenchmen. (Marshall Islands protectorate.) A decree issued by the Imperial Commissioner for the Marshall Islands protectorate sets the personal taxes that the natives of the protectorate must pay annually from April 1 this year at 360,000 pounds copra. The collection of the copra in the tax districts is the responsibility of certain chiefs, who are paid the third part of the value of the copra they deliver (a pound at 4 pounds) as a bonus. (Virements.) After the Chancellor of Cameroon, Count M. Pfeil, has represented the Governor there for a time, the present provisional Imperial Commissioner of Togo, Consul v. Puttkamer, has been entrusted with the representation of the Governor of Cameroon and the District Commissioner Dr. Krabbes at Viktoria on the Ambashai in the Cameroon region has been appointed Deputy Imperial Commissioner in Togo. The government assessor Leist, who has been employed in the Foreign Office for some time, has been attached to the government in Cameroon. - (Gaetano Casati), Emin Pasha's comrade, has arrived in Italy, joyfully welcomed by his compatriots and all those who still have an understanding for the high and noble in the human breast. Gactano Casati, who won the rank of captain on the battlefields of 1866, went to North Africa with Camperio, the emissary of the Milanese Societa d'Esplorazione commerriale, to Kharkum and then to Meihra er Rek, the starting point of so many caravans to the south, just over 40 years ago. There he met Junker in Mbrno; both are the Europeans who, based on the work of Miani, Plaggia, Schweinfurth, Lupton, Potagos and Bohndorf, traveled furthest towards the Aquator. From there Casati moved to Lado, where he met Emin Pasha for the first time in 1883, then went to Monbuttuland, but was recalled to Lado in 1884 as a result of the outbreak of the uprising and placed himself entirely at Emin Pasha's disposal. He took part in the return march up the Nile to Wadelei and was then sent to Kadrega, to the king of Unvoro as Emin's confidant, in order to establish contact with the coast. At Kabrega, Casati found himself in a dangerous situation, as a fierce battle between the king and Mwanga, the king of Uganda, was imminent, which worsened the more the rumor spread that Stanley was approaching with a powerful expedition of thousands of men to fight Uganda and Unvoro. Casati could have reached the coast in 1867, as the Italian consul in Sanstbar had sent him a letter of credit, but he refused in manly and noble words (see Kolonialzeitung No. 32, 1888): "I have promised Emin Pasha to help him untie the Gordian knot that binds the province together, and this promise binds me." In February 1888, however, disaster struck, he was attacked by the king's henchmen, robbed of all his belongings and led to the banks of the Albert Nyanza, where he and his servants were tied naked to trees and left to their fate. However, in a way that has not yet been explained, they managed to get rid of the gang and wandered around on the shore until a servant discovered a canoe and, on the off chance, went out onto the lake to get help. He also came across a steamer belonging to Emin Pasha, whose captain immediately went to the governor. Emin Pasha set off in the "Khediv", sailed along the eastern shore of the lake and was called by Casati himself. A few minutes sufficed to free him and his companions from their horrible situation. It goes without saying that Casati did not abandon his lifesaver because Stanler wanted to take him safely to the coast; Casati held out next to the Pasha until the last moment. He showed not only perseverance and kindness, but also unselfishness and mastery, so that he deserves a place alongside the most outstanding explorers. Thanks to his good memory, he intends to restore all his documents lost and destroyed in Africa and his book, which will be published at the end of the year, will contain many surprises. Casati, in whose honor the Italians are now holding lavish celebrations, also differs in his outward appearance in the most pleasant way from the pretentious and arrogant nature of Stanley, so that sympathy for him will not be extinguished. (In the South and Central American republics) uprisings are again the order of the day. War is raging between Guatemala and San Salvador, in Argentina a revolution has broken out against President Celman, but has been put down by him by force of arms, and in Chile everything seems to be heading towards a crisis. - (Karl v. Koseritz), the courageous champion of Germanism in Brazil, died suddenly at the end of May as a result of the excitement caused by his opponents' imprisonment and cruel treatment for political reasons. Against all law, he had been deprived of his freedom in the most brutal and unlawful manner and his friends were unable to obtain atonement for the crime. It is a sad page in the history of the Brazilian Republic. As Koseritz left his family in difficult circumstances, the Germans in Rio Grande do Sul have organized collections, the proceeds of which bear witness to the love and veneration that the deceased enjoyed in wide circles.

"Br. Ernst von Hesse=Wartegg. Mexico, country and people. Travels on new paths through the Aztec country. With 93 illustrations and a railroad map. Vienna, Ed. Hölzel. 643 pages. Price brochirt 8,40 Mk. In his new work, the travel writer describes his travels through Mexico and proves himself to be a good observer, as we already know him from his earlier works. This book, which is very readable in those parts where the country and its people are described from his own experience, loses out due to too many reports of hearsay, which the author believes he is not allowed to conceal. In this respect, the stories of robbers that Antor, who travels as a living arsenal, tells us are particularly amusing, only to admit with regret on page 429 "that he has not yet come across the smallest robber". These and other facetious exaggerations, in addition to often somewhat questionable stylistic flourishes, the book gives a vivid picture of today's Mexico.

On the return of Dr. Peters. Dr. Peters, who visited Casati in Monza on his journey from Naples to here, will return to Verlin next Monday, and the venture, which as the German Emin Pasha expedition has been the subject of both lively participation and attacks, will thus come to an end. We do not need to revisit the history of the expedition over the last two years; readers of the Kolonialzeitung, which published the reports of the expedition, still fully remember the events, and the images of the bold travelers, especially of the leader, Dr. Peters, are still vivid in their minds. Almost two years have now passed since the German Colonial Society gave its support to the Emin Pasha expedition at its general meeting in Wiesbaden, and the departments warmly embraced the great idea. Although nothing was lacking, the actual goal of bringing help to Emin Pasha was not achieved, despite all the heroism displayed by the members of the expedition, due to circumstances that were completely independent of the expedition's activities. But the expedition did what was humanly possible and will always do honor to the German name. His Serene Highness Prince zu Hohenlohe=Langenburg had therefore sent him a welcoming telegram published in No. 16 of the "Kolonialzeitung" on July 19 after learning of Dr. Peters' return to the coast, to which the reply has now arrived. The letter from Dr. Peters reads: S. S. "Madura", July 31, 1890, Red Sea. Your Serene Highness, I have the honor of expressing my heartfelt thanks for the telegram of the 11th of this month, by which Your Serene Highness, on behalf of the German Colonial Society, welcomed me on my return from the interior. I was very pleased and moved by the appreciative assessment of my expedition expressed therein. On this journey I have repeatedly had the opportunity to realize how little, even with the best will in the world, the individual is capable of; and I have experienced the caring help of Providence, which has led us safely through battles and impending dangers. So I cannot assume that all these efforts were made for nothing, but I am imbued with the conviction that they are somehow intended in God's great world plan and will benefit our cause and the German people. This awareness kept me going on the expedition and I hold on to this conviction. And I am encouraged in this by the friendly call which Your Serene Highness sent me across the sea to the East African coast in the name of the German Colonial Society. I humbly request Your Serene Highness to kindly convey my sincere and warmest thanks to the Board of the German Colonial Society with the assurance that I am always willing to do all I can for the greatness of our German fatherland and for the ideas which the German Colonial Society in particular espouses. Your Serene Highness will accept the assurance of my constant reverence and deepest esteem, with which I have the honor to remain Your Serene Highness, most devoted Karl Peters. The political division of Africa. Today, one may well marvel at the division of the Indian world by Pope Alexander VI in 1494 and wonder at the fact that the papal decisions of his time were regarded as quite unprecedentedly wise and precluding any dispute for the future between Spaniards and Portuguese. But the distribution of Africa, which has now taken place in an incredibly short time, will perhaps appear just as untenable and rational to later generations as the papal division soon turned out to be impracticable. It is true that there are striking differences between then and now: the territories to which the two most important colonizing powers of Europe laid claim at the beginning of the new era were world-wide, incomparably more extensive than those of Africa, but it is strange that the determination by latitude or longitude still plays the same role today as it did hundreds of years ago, even after the power of the rival states has increased enormously and the exploration of Africa has made progress in recent decades, which makes the complete knowledge of the country only a question of a relatively short time. Only in some border areas that have become superficially known through missionaries and travelers has it been possible to determine the border through rivers and mountains, otherwise one has had to limit oneself to determining the lines for the time being and leaving the redemption of these changes to the perhaps near, perhaps distant future. This crucial point of the comparison justifies the hope that the course of development will shift these border agreements according to the course of history, according to the changing power relations of the states, so that the observer will perhaps smile years later, recognizing the wisdom of the theories of the current diplomats of the colonial states, at the attempt to divide up an entire continent from the green table. And yet this division of Africa, whether it remains on paper or takes on substance, however strange later developments may be, was necessary to the same extent as the papal decision at the time, and will always be a landmark in history as a work of peace that silenced many jealousies. England, Germany, France, Portugal, Italy and Belgium, the colonial states of the old world, without possessing the land, without taking into account either the heathen blacks or the Mohammedan states, have now almost completely wedged South and Central Africa, and only in North Africa have they shied away from Morocco and the Turkish possession for easily understandable reasons.

Tripoli on the same footing, leaving to the distant future the question of what will become of the Mohammedan states east of Lake Chad, whether Christianity or Islam will prevail there one day The rapid process of the distribution of Africa actually began in the 1940s; it started with the battles between the Boers and the English in South Africa and was further initiated by Livingstone's travels and successes and the English missionary activity. Even before Germany could think of an active colonial policy, even before France, relying on its Senegal colony and Algiers, sought to realize enormous colonial plans, England's advance from the south had already begun, despite occasional defeats, keeping its goal, Central Africa, firmly in sight. After the English had become aware of the inner necessity of territorial colonial expansion as a result of the colonial aspirations of other nations and the increasing importance of the extensive colonial economy for trade, the advance accelerated. Even if this was not without resistance on the part of the British government, which was very indifferent to the colonial pushers, whether liberal or conservative, circumstances and far-sighted colonial chauvinists, as one is wont to say today, led it onto a path which it then followed with such great success. The German opponents of colonialism like to claim that it was Germany's actions that brought about this state of affairs, but they do not consider that England was essentially pushed into action by France's efforts to establish a colonial empire in East and West Africa, which it brought to a happy conclusion with such great skill and energy, and that the conflict with the Boers and South African tribes constantly required new efforts and further steps. The first stage in the distribution of Africa in recent times was the treaties between England, Germany, France and Portugal in 1885 and 1886, and the formation of the Congo State. The second period began to develop dramatically with the influx of gold seekers into Matabeleland and the dispute between Portugal and England over the Zambezi and Nyassaland. We have followed the stages of this dispute step by step in the newspaper, which ended with the complete victory of the English, as Portugal was unable to resist England in the long term. Although the exact terms of the new Anglo-Portuguese treaty are not yet known with certainty, according to newspaper reports an approximate picture can be gained, which probably corresponds to the natural development. According to the treaty, Portugal concedes to England the Matabele and Mashonaland south of the Zambezi and retains north of the Zambezi only a zone around Sumbo, a small, insignificant place on the river, which has undoubtedly always been Portuguese, and perhaps also around Tete. The whole of Barotseland, as well as the western shore of Lake Nyassa and the Schire as far as the Ruo, was given to England. The land between the eastern shore of Lake Nyassa and the coast as well as the source country of the Zambezi remained with Portugal. Two points are not yet entirely clear, firstly the affiliation of Blantyre and the other English stations, which lie on the left bank of the Shire, and the determination of the headwaters of the Zambezi. England has nothing to do in the latter, while Portugal did not know how to conclude treaties with Muata Kiamvo, the ruler of the Lunda Empire, at the right time, so that the Congo State has now established a station in his residence (approximately east of the Koango River at latitude 6° 30* and longitude 17° 10*) and appointed a district commissioner in Lieutenant Dhanis. Incidentally, the treaty has not yet been approved by the Portuguese Cortes and is likely to lead to very fierce disputes, especially as opposition is gathering around an enterprising Lieutenant Cotinho in the Shir= area itself. This Cotnho has declared himself independent, wants to confront the English and is supported by the population, so that the governor of Quelimane had to report that he could not vouch for the reliability of his troops if he were forced to launch a violent attack on Cotinho. Cdarles Dilke, in his recently published work: Problems of tirester Britain, speaks about all these concessions to England, which were in contrast to the earlier ones *): "If one summarizes what we have discovered with regard to our new protectorates and recent annexations, it should be noted that until around 1881 we almost regularly refused to accept the unbidden gifts of lords that had been made to us. Lord Palmerston argeseynt such gift= just as firmly as Dieracii or Glakstene. The annexation of Copern was only resented for minor reasons. As for Fiji, the annexation became necessary, like that of New Zealand earlier, because of the impossibility of suppressing Verdeanism in any other way (l)."
(The declarations of the Portuguese government represent just as many defeats!), Portugal was guaranteed possession of the land from the coast to the Nyassa, as the English did not recognize the "hinterland theory" towards Portugal, which the Germans had recently brought to the fore again and which the French later happily applied in their negotiations with England. In its efforts to reach Matabeleland, England has also secured the consent of Transvaal,3) as there are likely to be battles there with the natives, who will only be held back with difficulty by Lobengula from attacking the whites. According to the latest reports, one part of the vanguard of the British-South African company, which has penetrated the country on both flanks, operating towards Mashonaland, has already crossed the Lundi River at about 20 degrees south latitude. At the same time, however, the British-Foot African Company has also acquired Barotseland, starting from Schescheke, which lies opposite the eastern border of our South-West African protectorate on the left bank of the Zambezi. As the French missionary Jeanmairet") writes, an emissary of the English Company was already there in mid-February to persuade the Barotse to accept the Company's protectorate. Even though the chiefs at Schescheke seemed very inclined to do so, it was not yet possible to draw any conclusions about the mood of the "king". The envoy of the English company intended to go from there to Katanga or Garanganze to conclude treaties, as many Englishmen still seem to be of the opinion that Katanga, where English missions are already located, does not belong to the Congo State, but to the one who first concludes treaties with the notorious Msiri. However, the Congo State's expedition to explore the Lualaba and Luopula will certainly prevent such ambitions forever. While England has also secured large territories in the south and east through the Anglo-German agreement, it has not been inactive in the west either. On August 5, an agreement was concluded between Lord Salisbury and Waddington in response to France's refusal to amend the provisions of the treaty of March 10, 1862, concerning the Sultan of Zanzibar. According to this agreement, France recognizes the British protectorate over the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba, whereas Lord Salisbury recognizes the protectorate of France over the island of Madagascar with its consequences, namely with regard to the exequaturs of British consuls and agencies, which must be applied for through the mediation of the French Resident-General. In Madagascar, the missions of both countries are to enjoy complete protection, and religious toleration and freedom for all forms of worship and for religious instruction are guaranteed. The English declaration then goes on to say: "The Government of Her Britannic Majesty recognizes the sphere of influence of France in the south of her North African possessions as far as a line drawn from Say on the Niger to Barruwa on Lake Chad, so as to embrace in the zone of action of the Niger Company all that reasonably belongs to the Kingdom of Sokoto. The line is to be determined by commissioners to be appointed. Her Britannic Majesty's Government undertakes to appoint without delay two Commissioners to meet in Paris with two Commissioners appointed by the Government of the French Republic for the purpose of ascertaining the particulars of the above-mentioned line. It is, however, expressly agreed that even if the work of these commissioners should not result in complete agreement on all the details of the line, the agreement between the two governments on the general boundary adjustment referred to above shall nevertheless remain binding. The Commissioners*) will also be entrusted with the task of adjusting the *) See in particular the article: "Die britische füdafrikanische Gesellschaft" (The British African Company) and map in No. 37, 1889 The English are the inventors of this theory. Thackerey writes in the "Birginians": "We used to acquire our American colonies under a law which was quite convenient for the lawmakers. It was the principle that he who occupied the coast had a right to all the interior as far as the Pacific Ocean, so that the British charters only fixed the boundary of the colonies from north to south, and did not designate them from east to west." The French, however, already had colonies in the north and south at that time and tried to establish a connection on the Miisisippi until the British and French settlers met at the Obio in 1753. The facts later came to the aid of the English theory, so that the French were pushed back. See: The agreement between England and Transvaal, concerning the article Swaziland in this issue. See l'Afrique explorée et civilisée, issue 8. 1890. According to the "Liberte", Captain Binger, the well-known explorer of the Niger region, Duvergier, traveler in the Tuareg countries, and Desbuissons, geographer in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, would have given the two states the same name.

The treaty will establish the respective spheres of influence of the two countries in the region extending to the west and south of the middle and upper Niger. This treaty is of some importance to Germany because it will also bring the delimitation of the Togo area into flux. We are also particularly interested in the intended expansion of France beyond the Ubanghi to the north and the establishment of our borders in the hinterland of Cameroon. Although the treaty between France and England does not mention Cameroon at all, the Nordd. Allg. Zig. carried a report "from a well-informed source in this regard", according to which our fears expressed in the previous issue that we would be cut off from Lake Chad have been somewhat alleviated. The communication is based on the assertion that England and France were "guided by a spirit of great consideration for German trade and transportation interests." This was particularly evident in the determination of the sphere of interest from Cameroon to the interior. It then goes on to say: "Germany has been granted a strip of land 150 kilometers wide beyond the Benue. 150 kilometers wide strip of land that extends north to Lake Chad. This strip of land is enclosed to the west by the English (Sokoto) and often by the French (Congo français) hinterland sphere and comprises part of the Adamana Empire. This opens up access to the central landscapes of Sudan for German trade, even if not in the near future. As far as Togo is concerned, the hinterland is bounded in the north by a mountain range forming a natural divide, which extends from northern Liberia eastwards to the mouth of the Benue into the Niger and first passes through part of Senegambia, then Togo, Dahomey and the Third Protectorate on the lower Niger. Of importance here is the neutralization of a territory between the English Gold Coast, the French sphere of influence and the German Togo. In this neutral area lie the two very frequent trading stations of Salaga and Jendi, which are highly frequented inland markets. It is striking that an agreement between England and France on the borders of their West African possessions is also supposed to have fixed the borders of the German possessions in Cameroon and Togo. From the report in the "Nordd. Allg. Zig" it may perhaps be concluded that the relevant agreements were not made without the cooperation of the German government. The English Parliament has already approved the agreement with Frankreick, as the opposition could not derive sufficient grounds for action from the cession of the protectorate of Madagascar to France, which has claimed the country for years on the basis of a treaty, albeit a forged one in the English opinion, and Salisbury described the lands north of the border line from Say to Barruwa as "of easy soil". The southern border of the Sahara does indeed extend to this point, but the French, who have already set up a commission under the chairmanship of the Minister of Freycinet for the construction of the Trans-Saharan Railway, have nevertheless initiated the formation of a vast West African empire, which one can only hope will withstand the onslaught of the Mohammedan fanatics. In this way, the purposeful England has come to terms with all its rivals or opponents, with only the demarcation with Italy over the north-eastern corner remaining. Since England can make a few small concessions in the Gulf of Aden, this settlement will also come about without great difficulty. The Third World Empire has grown enormously, and it will require enormous efforts on the part of the British to make this area useful to their interests and to maintain it permanently. Will the English be up to this task! The agreement between England and Transvaal concerning Swastland was adopted by the People's Council on August 8th by 20 votes to 10. The main provisions of the treaty are as follows: 1. the independence of the people of Swastland is reaffirmed in accordance with the treaty of 1884. The government of the country shall regulate all affairs of the natives. 2. the cEuropean colonists shall be under a mixed supervisory authority. 3. a court of justice for the Europeans is to be established in the same way, which will judge according to Dutch and Roman law. The two commissioners for the demarcation of the Sudanese territories, Hanotaux and Haußmann, are to be appointed in an advisory capacity.
(4) All legally acquired rights must be recognized by a joint commission of administrative officials and all judges. (5) The Government of the South African Republic undertakes not to take sides in the impending struggles of the South African Company against the natives in the north and north-west of the Republic, but to assist by its influence in maintaining the order and authority of the South African Company within its territories in accordance with the charter granted to it by the British Government The British Government recognizes the concession granted by the King of Swaziland to the South African Republic for the construction of a railroad through Swaziland to the sea. The British Government also consents to the intention of the Government of the South African Republic to acquire a strip of land of 10 miles on the Kosibai. Provisions are made that the Kosibai or the aforesaid strip of land shall not fall into the possession, control or dominion of any foreign power. 8. the Transvaal shall enter into a Customs Union with the Cape Colony, the Orange Free State and Betschuanaland on terms to be agreed upon. (9) If the accession to the Customs Union has not taken place within six months, the agreement shall be considered null and void on account of the Kosibai. On the other hand, the joint government over Swastland shall remain in force for three years and shall continue beyond this period unless one of the contracting parties terminates the treaty six months before its expiry. If, however, Transvaal enters the Customs Union, the duration of the treaty is unlimited. We reserve the right to discuss the treaty, especially with regard to its effect on German interests, until the treaty is available in the wording adopted by the Volkoraad. The Matabele country. (With map.) Karl Mauch's travels in the years 1865 to 1872 first drew attention to Matabeleland. He deserves credit for pointing out the treasures of this country after Livingstone, Baldwin, Baines and Chayman had touched on these areas. Mauch's information was later confirmed and expanded by Eduard Mohr, Frank Oates and Holub. Now that England has recently placed Matadeleland under its protection, let us take a closer look at the country and its people. The inhabitants, belonging to the Zulu tribe, emigrated from Zululand over the Drakensberg Mountains with 20,000 people, avoiding the pressure of the tyrant Chaka. The pursuing Chala was defeated. The victors moved further northwest under Mosilikage, drove the Betschnana before them and settled in the very fertile region of the Magalis Mountains. From there they were displaced by the Boers coming across the Vaal River. They then founded today's Matabele Empire, which stretches south to 22 degrees and north to the Zambezi. The Mashona, who had previously lived here and were divided among themselves, were driven far to the north and almost wiped out. The Matabele's western neighbors are the peaceful Makalaka, farmers and cattle breeders who pay them tribute. They live quite densely along the stretches between the Tati= and Maytengue rivers from 20 degrees 12 minutes to 20 degrees 30 minutes. North of here up to the Sambest, the Matabele have devastated everything and turned the land into a wasteland. The northeasternmost part of the Matabe area bordering here is now the most powerful. Further advances north of the Sambest were thwarted by a small but powerful enemy, the tsetse fly. On the other hand, the expansion was easily achieved in the other direction by pushing back the unwarlike Makalaka, whose boys were put among the warriors. Old walled fortifications along the Tati River still bear witness to the battles that took place there. Mosilikatze had not only put an end to the empire of the Makalaka, but had also destroyed half of that of the Maschona and annihilated that of the peaceful Manansa. The invaders fled to the neighboring areas after the Matabele had repeatedly invaded. The current king of the Matadele, Lobengula, Mosilikatzes Sodn, defeated his enemy Umbigo in 1870, who had confronted him at Sukendaba with 8,000 men. Throwing away the masses of fire, the Matadele rushed at the enemy in the old fighting style with the Assagais and blew him to pieces, leaving the slain to the hyenas and jackals, which become extremely bold and dangerous after such a meal. Lobengula, now the undisputed ruler, celebrated a grand coronation feast in the Gubuluwajo residence, where hundreds of oxen were slaughtered for the 50,000 people present. He is feared everywhere, but shows the greatest consideration and care towards the whites so that no misfortune befalls them in his country. For example, he only allows them to advance towards Sambest in good seasons and provides them with guides whose wages are paid to the chief behind

until it becomes clear that they have fulfilled their duty. As soon as the treaty is concluded, no leader dares to go rogue for fear of the king's revenge. Although the king demands a gift from the travelers, he returns it generously. For permission to shoot Elesanten, the gift must of course consist of a rifle. Lobenqula is not without noble sentiments. For example, he offered Eduard Mohr 2 horses as a gift. When he saw the photograph of Mohr's deceased mother, he said: "You white people are lucky, your art is so great that you can even see the deceased. Your hearts need not turn sour" etc. Although the Matabele are notorious for being wild and warlike, provided that peace reigns in the country and the throne is occupied, no white person who observes the customs of the country has to fear for his property or life. Indeed, Mohr cites cases where his unguarded property remained for a long time in greater security than would have been conceivable in European countries. He emphasizes the great attachment of the Zulus to their master and testifies that, if treated well, they are very obedient, docile and, especially the Kaffirs, highly compliant. The border is closely guarded. Every traveler is followed by natives who watch him at every turn to find out his purpose. If it turns out that he is looking for gold, the gift to be given increases. The Matadele is a handsome, strong figure and a beautiful sight for all to see in his uniform war costume. Black, high ostrich feathers wrap around his head and a cloak of the same feathers reaches down to his hips. His elbows and knees are adorned with tufts of white oxtails. The left hand holds a large shield made of oxhide, painted white and black with white horizontal stripes. A stick is attached inside to hold the shield, the upper edge of which is edged with jackal tails. The right hand wields several spears (assagais), with which they even confront lions. The most common route into Matadeleland is via the town of Shoshone, where the routes from the Orange Free State, West Griqualand and Transvaal join to run north to the Zambezi, north-east to the Matabele and Mashonaland and Lake Ngami, and north-west to Damaraland. This favorable location will support the prosperity of Shoshone, although its population has fallen from 30,000 to 6,000 due to King Sekhomo's civil war and emigration. In 1873 Lobengula had defeated and driven out Prince Maicheen of Shoshong and installed the son of a former Beichnana chief. The road from Shosheng to Tati leads through monotonous mimosa and mopani forests, framed by huge, dark rocky cliffs, jumbled together in the greatest disorder. *) Shosheng was recently abandoned as Khama's residence due to lack of water. D. R.
The Makalapsi stream still offers water and fodder, but then the draught animals have to do without it for 32 hours, because the banks of the mostly waterless rivers Tuani, Lotsani and Seruli, which belong to the Notuani region, are dry and barren. On the Notuani itself, however, there is some food to be found. Only on the Gokwe River, a tributary of the Molutsi, are there individual ponds. At night they form gathering points for numerous lions (called "bush baas" by the Boers). If you camp there, you must provide strong, dense thorn fencing and ensure that the camp walls are constantly maintained, otherwise you can be sure of a visit from the king of beasts. In the bed of the Shasha River, south of Tati, no water is to be expected, at least in July. Further north, the path also corresponds to the character of Matabeleland, as it remains hilly and here and there shows steeply rising granite peaks surrounded by mopane forest, which unfortunately provides no shade, as the leaves have a peculiar position with the edge facing upwards, as if they wanted to escape the sun's rays. Tati lies on the tributary of the Shasha, the Tati, which, although sometimes 480 feet wide, suddenly becomes waterless due to seepage. However, many ponds remain, and water can easily be obtained by digging. Tati, often named because of the gold deposits discovered by Mauch, was once the seat of the industrious Maschona, who were then pushed northwards by the Matabele. They laboriously dug shafts up to 40 feet deep in the quartz rock, made it brittle by fire, pounded it in mortars and extracted the gold. Alluvial gold, on the other hand, was not found. In order to facilitate the process of gold extraction, the Englishman Swinbourne managed, with unspeakable difficulty, to build a steam engine to crush the rock, along with a locomotive pulled by 32 oxen, and even managed to get as far as Jnpatin. However, the Matabele were so afraid of the locomobile that they only allowed it to advance 120 miles beyond Tati. It had to return to this place. The miners' camp was on the left bank of the Tatl. The life of these gold seekers is extremely arduous. Fortunately, food is supplied by the peaceful Makalaka living in the nearby villages, but other necessities can only be obtained from Durban (135 miles as the crow flies). Living in miserable huts, they work hard day and night, taking turns to cook. The heat in the pits, squeezed between the mountains, stays at 32 degrees R. at noon, while the temperature at night is 7, in May, June. July often drops below Rull. The result of the work was about 7-24 ounces of gold per 1 ton of quartz. The lack of a crushing machine makes the work extremely difficult. Only the Wethnachtöfest brings some variety and fun into the monotonous life of the gold miners. On hearing of the diamond finds in Transvaal, many of the miners migrated there. Bushmen also live on the Tati between the Matabele in the north and the Betschuana in the south, but like hunted game. Supported by exceptionally keen senses, they subsist meagrely by hunting. However, they are not allowed to hunt ostriches and elephants, as this is an exclusive

Property of the king. In Tati itself there is a small garrison of Matabele to guard the border to the south-east. Beyond the gold mines stretches a graceful region interspersed with granite. The Makalakas, the Matabele grain farmers who live there, have miles of fields of maize and durra. The best food awaits the traveler, as there is an abundance of sheep, pearl and Namaqna chickens, eggs, green corn, watermelons, pumpkins, marula wine and a variety of tree fruits. Further north, from Babas onwards, the picture is admittedly less enticing, because there, as already mentioned, large stretches are depopulated by the Matabele. From Tati to Jnyatin, our route crosses a plateau, the watershed between the Limpopo and the Sambest. From the little river Ramakoban onwards, the terrain becomes fertile, the macula tree appears, the fruit of which is used to make wine. The temperature is pleasant, in the middle of the day only 20 degrees R. In July Mohr found 16-17 degrees R. at noon, but at a point below 19 degrees 20 min. south latitude, which lies 4800 feet above the sea, with very dry air, frost and ice at night, while snow never occurred. From Nai to the end of September there is always a south-easterly wind. Wine thrives wildly. The great fertility of the soil is further enhanced by the fact that the Zulus cut the dried grass for miles. From the Mangwe stream, which is always full of water and flows down from the Matoppo Mountains into the Shasha, we are surrounded by a magnificent laud forest with huge natural granite walls and rock formations towards the Guap River. Here, the appearance of the white man is an unheard-of event. However, the good-natured natives are content to watch him closely in order to find out his purpose of travel. The white traveler is pleasantly surprised to find excellent Joalla beer at the house of the chief Numkaninla. For this reason alone, this point is recommended as a permanent camp site. In addition, the Mangwe and its tributaries always carry water; wood and game are plentiful and the Makalaka willingly supply corn and grain. The further march to the Guay, a southern tributary of the Zambezi, leads over green hills and through mopane forest. Although the Matabele are excellent pack carriers and, with the prospect of meat food, show extraordinary marching performance, the area along the Guav is sometimes soaked by thunderstorms, uninhabited and without food that the advance often faces insurmountable difficulties. Even 28 oxen are then unable to move the wagon. Mohr was also forced to return to the Mangwe to seek relief there. In the garden planted there, he found welcome treasures of radishes, parsley, lettuce, peas, cucumbers, beans, cauliflower, tomatoes and potatoes. (Such vegetables are said to be the best remedy for scurvy.) In addition, the obliging locals offered milk, watermelons, cornbread, etc., as well as goats and sheep in exchange for glass beads. The only disturbance in this epicurean camp is caused by the lion, whose terrible roar interrupts the night's rest. At the same time, jackals appear to take what the lion has left of the prey. The large venomous snake Mhamba, which usually preys on rats, is not a cozy but a welcome guest. Despite the abundance of game in the area, the traveler must be careful to always take goats and sheep with him, because the goat needs little food, is easy to herd, marches well, gets around everywhere, stays fat and does not suffer from the tsetje fly. It is only slaughtered where game is scared away by elephants or where there is a lack of water. The sheep is less frugal than the goat. Emerging from the rocky pass of Monyama, the eye is stunned by the immense sea of iron that stretches far and wide in the wildest confusion. The most monstrous granite shapes loom in the sky. Often deceptively similar to castles and towers. Apart from the aloe and the euphorbia, no plant can gain a foothold on this mirror-smooth rock. You also cross the Kumula stream, which is notorious for its numerous and very bold lions and is surrounded by forest. Swarms of locusts often cause such destruction here in just a few minutes that the grass is destroyed down to the roots. The whites are only allowed to penetrate as far as Inpatin in times of peace, because the king fears that misfortune might otherwise befall them. If there is unrest in the country, travelers are relentlessly sent back to Mangwe. Here it is easy for them to set up camp, whereas on the plateau of Jnvatin, 4,100 English feet above sea level, food is hard to come by and cattle are only given away with the king's permission; he usually allows this, but a lot of time is lost. - While open grassland with ponds predominates as far as the Guay, it becomes forested and rugged further north. At the Changani River, the wild Vergland begins with dense forest and huge baobad trees. Further west to the Daka River, rocky terrain spreads out As soon as spring arrives here in October and the rains gradually become heavier, everything immediately turns lush and green, but the sun soon becomes oppressive (e.g. 26 degrees Reaumur at midday at the end of October) and the thunderstorms grow to terrible intensity. Gradually, however, the rain decreases again, so that the months of January and February remain fairly dry in this latitude. Later, heavy rains occur again, so that 2 rainy seasons can be expected here. The area is abundant with animals. The most numerous are the unwinged grasshoppers, which move from southeast to northwest. They quickly destroy the entire plant world. Luckily, only the cucumber is spared. More pleasing are the countless quaggas, giraffe, buffalo, eland and sable antelope that roam here. But without the extraordinarily keen senses of the cassowaries, who are fully equipped to act as sniffer dogs, it would often be almost impossible to track down the game. In addition, the caser does an incredible job of bringing home the prey. He often drags 120 pounds for miles over the most impassable routes after he has wrapped the meat in grass and tied it up tightly with skin. If, as already mentioned, the prospect of eating meat spurs him on to incredible exertion, what is almost more admirable is the vast quantities of meat he can consume. No part, no matter how disgusting or putrid, is spurned, so that there is not the slightest thing left for hyenas and jackals. The elephants' greatest hunting ground stretches as a wasteland for 26 miles from the Nata River to the Sambest. At the ponds there, they hollow out formal pits in which they take mud baths. They then rub the clay crust formed on their bodies off on the tree trunks. The rhinoceros has a keen sense of smell but poor eyesight. It is not easy to get hold of, as it can walk for about a quarter of an hour after being seriously wounded, e.g. with a steel ball in its lungs. The hippos are usually scared away from the banks. Their meat is exquisitely juicy and tastes somewhere between roast beef and roast pork. The animals are very agile in the water, but leave it at night and often search for hours for some tender grass, which they eat completely smooth. They are pursued there by means of pitfall traps. The skin, which weighs up to 510 pounds when fresh, goes to England as heavy machine leather, the teeth are traded like ivory. The Zulus keep the fat as a delicacy. To shoot a hippopotamus in the water, which does not seem too dangerous, the boat has to be driven up close and the shot placed just behind the ear After half an hour, the dead animal comes back to the surface On land, this colossus runs faster than you might think. Lead bullets are useless against the hippopotamus as they flatten out. You absolutely need steel balls, 4 to 5 of which give 1 pound. It only attacks unfamiliar objects that stand in its way. The unarmed human is then lost. The lagoon-rich thickets between the lower Tschobe and the Zambezi are a paradise for elephants and hippos alike, where these monsters reign supreme. If one takes the route north-northwest from Tati to the famous Victoria Falls of the Zambezi, one reaches the 390-foot-wide Maytenguebach via Wanki and Menon, whose territory is roamed by countless lions, buffaloes, giraffes, quaggas and ostriches, while the black rhinoceros is found closer to the Nata River. The area of the tsetse fly begins at 19 degrees 11 minutes south latitude. As it is absolutely destructive to oxen, horses and even dogs, the carts have to stay behind here. At most, carts harnessed with donkeys, which do not suffer from the fly, can go further. The insect is very quick and bites immediately. Although the sting penetrates the jacket and shirt, the person feels no consequences apart from a severe itch. In the middle of the tsetse's territory there are places without this insect, but a little further on whole swarms swoop down on their victims from the bushes. Concentrated ammonia is used as a remedy against their bite, as well as that of the snakes. From Invatin you can cover the 200 English miles to the falls on foot in ten days. If one comes from Tati, on the other hand, the wagon can be brought to within a few miles of the falls, but this requires the king's permission, and the sub-chiefs (Indunas) cause all kinds of difficulties. The closer you get to the Sambest, the more difficult it becomes to advance; thorns and sharp stones tear your clothes and the best footwear to shreds. More than 20 English miles away, the stare can already see 4 to 5 mysterious columns of water dust above the falls, 6-800 feet high depending on the distance; 2 miles further and their roar becomes audible to the ear. Although it is only 54 days' march from Wanki's village to the falls, there is no trace of the river anywhere, as its banks rise vertically to a height of 600 feet. The valleys leading into the river are also so deeply cut and rugged that a march along the impassable banks is unthinkable. Only when you get very close do you see the longed-for river rushing deep down between black rocks, the lower third of which lacks any vegetation, while the rest of the wall is covered with the most luxuriant vegetation. In contrast, at the top you enter dazzling white crystalline quartz, which lies on bedrock. Eye and ear are enchanted. At night, however, the rolling roar of the crashing waters can be heard deafeningly from miles away. Now that we have reached the moistened area of the eternal spray, we are surrounded by the most luxuriant flora imaginable. Giant trees of unprecedented splendor, sycamores and mimosas, towering over our tallest poplars, draw the admiring eye upwards, while at our feet the greenish-blue, transparent mass of water of the Zambezi River rushes by at a speed of three knots. Upstream, we overlook the ¼ German Melle-three river, overlooked by numerous forest-covered islands. Now it plunges in a wide line 400 feet down into the gorge. Narrowed to /12 of its width, the 240-300 feet wide foaming waters seem to want to burst the blocking rock walls. Finally, after all the fury and force of the restraining element has broken against the rigid rock, all the rushing waters from east and west unite in a 270-foot-wide fissure. The view across the entire width of the falls can only be seen for a few moments at a time due to the rain of dust. Only at the southern end does a ledge allow you to get 100-200 steps in front of the rock face and enjoy the view of the entire enormous width of the river. The western end, although also unobstructed, offers only a limited view. The water there is interrupted by large masses of rock. Suddenly the wind parts the dust shower and you are standing in the sunshine. The crowning glory of the whole natural spectacle is two circular double rainbows in a dusting of water. The clarity of their colors is much sharper than we ever see in the sky, even dazzling. Soon several more appear and disappear again. This is why the falls were called "Chongwo", i.e. rainbow, or Metso-a-lunga.

Page 214

These dust veils rise with a deafening roar from the 400-foot-deep gorge, rising another 650 feet into the sky. This changes depending on the mass of water, the season and the wind. That is why travelers' accounts vary. Livingstone saw the Victoria Falls in November 1855 and August 1860, Baldwin in August 1800, Baines and Chapman in July and August 1862, Mohr in June 1870, Holud in September 1875 and October 1885, Dates in New Year 1875. The latter was the only one to see the largest mass of water in the rainy season. A spot at the western end is recommended as the best place to camp, about 800 steps away from the falls because of the water dust. However, you should not stay long in the same camp on the Zambezi, as only a brisk change of clothes protects against fever. This enemy is most feared here at the time of the first rains, in September, and when the water dries up, in January, February and March. The natives are most afraid of September. Below the falls, the water rushes wildly as if it cannot calm down. Several strong bends in the river constantly conjure up new images. While untameable fish enliven the clear flood, crocodiles dwell on the banks. Hippopotamus and game in countless numbers, especially inviting for hunting in October. But if you want to hunt, you need a heavy caliber and steel bullets, as well as the native dogs. After returning from the falls, the travelers found their wagons left outside the Tsetse area undamaged, for which the natives deserve all praise. All those who have been privileged to see the marvelous Victoria Falls agree that they far surpass the Niagara Falls in grandeur, whose cave is only half as large, even if the Sambest carries less water outside the rainy season. If it is possible to win a point for the overall view of the Victoria Falls, they can be called the most magnificent natural spectacle in the world. The colonial budget of the Netherlands. In No. 34 of the previous issue of this newspaper, we discussed the expenditure claimed by the colonial administration of the Dutch East Indies in the budget for the year 1890; this expenditure, amounting to 140,500,254 fl., contrasts with a total income of 128,124,865 fl., and it will not be useless to take a brief look at it today in order to gain an idea of the rich resources of the Dutch East Indian possessions. The revenue, the amount of which for the year 1890 falls short of the expenditure by 12,375,389 fl., is received partly in the Netherlands and partly in India; 32,808,612 fl. are allotted to the Netherlands and 95,316,253 fl. to India. A considerable sum is obtained from the sale of products for which the royal administration has reserved a monopoly in certain parts of India; this includes the income from the sale of the products cassava, sugar, cinchona bark and tin; it amounts to a total of 41,619,650 fl., of which the Netherlands accounts for 29,776,377 fl. and India for 21,843,273 fl. A further item of income is the remuneration owed by the treasury to the colonies for the provisioning of imperial troops in Judia or for the delivery of supplies to the imperial navy. This item is budgeted at 1,936,535 fl. for the year 1890, of which 618,735 fl. will be collected in the Netherlands and 1,317,800 fl. in Jndia. The third and most important revenue item is the income from taxes, customs duties, land rents, port dues, stamp duties and rents, salt and opium monopoly, etc., which amount to 84,568,680 fl., of which only 2413,500 fl. are collected in the Netherlands and 82,155,180 fl. in India. 1. revenue from the sale of products. Among the products from the sale of which the Dutch government has made a large profit for decades, cassava is the most important; sugar is of less importance, which for some years has yielded no profit, while the maintenance of the government plantations has even required large subsidies; cinchona bark is cultivated to a lesser extent in West Java and tin is only exploited by the government on the island of Banka, while the mines on Billiton are leased to the Chinese. Kafsee. Coffee is cultivated throughout Java (with the exception of private estates, of course) on behalf of the government, and the product must be delivered from the villages to the government packing houses at certain prices. In addition to Java, the same institution exists in the Residentie (province) of West Sumatra and in the Residentie Menado (North Celebes). In these areas, not only is the cash crop delivered compulsorily, but cultivation is also compulsory; the dessas (villages) are required by the government to plant new crops to the prescribed extent. Recently, preparations have been made for the abolition of compulsory cultivation in Java, but the obligation to deliver the harvested coffee to the government packing houses, which are spread all over Java and the two aforementioned residences on West Sumatra and North Celebes in order to collect the harvest, remains in force. There are currently over 420 such packing houses in Java, which offer enough space to hold over 1 million picols of cash. The obligation to cultivate and deliver the product to the government packing houses is based on the so-called "Cultuurstelzel" (cultivation system) of Governor General van den Bosch, who was in charge of the administration in India from 1830-35. In the early days, the system was extended to a large number of products, the cultivation of which was to be enforced or spread, but after 1870 in particular, it began to be restricted to a few items, as the system was often recognized as too oppressive for the population and, in its old form, not profitable enough for the government coffers. Much has been written about the legality and fairness of the system, which directly interferes with the working lives of over 10 million people in Java, for example, and a wide range of opinions have come to light, from the most resolute rejection and condemnation of the system to its unreserved acceptance. The system, to explain it briefly, is based on the ancient Hindu-Javanese institution, according to which all land belongs to the princes, and the cultivator, who is considered the owner as long as he maintains the land he has taken possession of under cultivation, is obliged to pay certain dues from the harvest of prescribed products. This obligation has always extended to the delivery of a wide variety of products as required by the location of the village, as well as to the provision of services for the maintenance of public buildings, road construction and the like. Of course, the extent to which taxes and labor services were required was not the same in the different parts of Java, but the same institution existed in general. The Dutch colonial administration was partly forced to reinforce the native superiors in their offices and to conserve the traditional institutions as far as possible, or considered it expedient to preserve them; it is therefore impossible to find any injustice in van den Bosch's cultural system, as it is based on centuries-old traditions. However, the hardships of the system are clear enough. The common man is dependent on the national ordeals, which in many cases know how to evade the control of the European official in charge; rightly or wrongly, he must put up with large deductions from the yield of his labor, which are caused by the institution that the superiors are entitled to a corresponding share of the harvest according to national law. Even though the Dutch administration tried to remedy these hardships as far as possible by prohibiting some payments in kind and instead remunerating the native superiors according to their rank, this evil has not been completely eliminated, because otherwise the system itself would have had to be abolished. A whole series of chikanas, which are also given to the native superior against the common man by the compulsion to establish new kaffir plantations, can be left unmentioned; it is clear that much injustice must occur where the Odere can intervene at any hour with regulations and punishments in the earning life of the individual. From the above it can be concluded that the wish is justified that forced culture and delivery should soon give way to free labor, but that tradition and custom make it necessary to initiate the transition to free labor with caution. In the first place, the Dutch administration recognizes no necessity to hasten the abolition of an institution as long as it yields such a good income. If the quantities of coffee that have been delivered to the government in Java over the last 30 years are taken into account, these figures clearly show the extent of the benefits. In the sixties an average of 845,200 picols were delivered annually, and in the seventies 865,000 and in the years 1880-1883 988,000; from 1884-1888, however, only 635,000 picols were delivered. The decline in recent years can be explained by the damaging influence of the leaf disease (hemileia vastatrix), which in many parts of Java reduces the yield.

Page 215

as the quality of the product is severely impaired. Over the entire period (30 years) a total of 25,217,000 picols were delivered. If we compare the five worst and the five best harvest years during this period, we obtain the following figures for deliveries to the packing houses: Smallest harvests. Largest harvests. 1864 436 721 picols. 1863 1120 669 picols. 1871 446304 1866 1094097 1875 493420 1876 1266 196 1885 500571 1879 1267 167 1887 254568 1883 1081 919 The market prices in the Netherlands do not appear to be directly dependent on the crop failure, which may be due to the fact that good and poor years alternate periodically in almost equal measure. In the years listed above, the gross selling prices in the Netherlands amounted to: 1864 42.34/16 guilders per picol. 1863 54.92 1/10 guilder per picol. 1871 44.63 1866 51.07¾/10 1875 69.47 7/1 1876 63.88¼10 1885 31.99 7/10 1879 54.82210 1887 59.53 ¾/10 1883 38.12 3/10 Deliveries to the packing houses in West Sumatra averaged 84,500 picols per year from 1884 to 1888, while those in the province of Menado amounted to approx. 15,000 picols per year for the same period; these quantities are therefore negligibly smaller than those in Java. From 1874 onwards, the government paid 14 guilders per picol to the natives,*) before this time considerably less, even less than 12 and in some places only 10 guilders; but let us assume an average of 13 guilders. To this must be added the cost of transporting the coffee from the packing houses in the interior to the port of embarkation, as well as the remuneration for transportation to the Netherlands and for sales expenses to the privileged "Nederlandsch Handels=Maatschappij", which handled the trade transactions for the government. On average, over the last 30 years, the government received 15.60 guilders for the picol at the port of departure; in the Netherlands, the picol for the same period averaged 50.55 guilders gross and 44.40 guilders net (after deduction of the transportation and selling expenses paid to the Handels-Maatschappij). Since the quantities sold at higher or lower prices pretty much balance each other out, it can be calculated that the government has benefited from the 25,217,000 picolitres of coffee negotiated in the last 30 years to the tune of 29.15 guilders net per picolitre on average, making a total net profit of 735,075,550 guilders. However, the 56,738,250 guilders paid in the same period for transportation costs in India and the payments to the Handels=Maatschappij amounting to 155084550 guilders are also to be credited to the Dutch purchasing circles. The better varieties of cash are mainly sold in the Netherlands, and, as already mentioned, through the intermediary of the privileged "Rederlandsche Handels=Maatschappij", which can be regarded as a modernized remnant of the old East India Company; moreover, the products are shipped in Dutch ships, so that from all these additional earnings, advantages and indirect benefits of the purchasing circles of the mother country a considerable source of income arises for them. For the year 1890, the income from the cash register is calculated at 34,292,687 guilders; 460,000 picols are sold in the Netherlands with a net profit of 24,264,737 guilders, in India around 200,000 picols with a profit of 10027950 guilders. Sugar. The government's sugar culture is limited to the eastern half of the island of Java. There are about 90 factories here for which the government has sugar cane grown. The contracts with these factories are based on a special law of 1870. As a result of bad years and great devastation caused to the plantations by the Sereh disease, the government has often had to come to the aid of the factory owners with substantial subsidies to help them overcome serious crises and maintain the crop. Sugar-growing regions are very unequal in terms of the fertility and suitability of the soil for cultivation. The fluctuations are quite considerable, ranging (in recent years) between 35-165 picols of sugar (pure yield per bouw). In 1889 the price was increased to 15 guilders per picol.
(- 7096 square meters). This fact could suffice to prove that the one-sided template under which the government acts as an entrepreneur must lead to great dissatisfaction. In reality, there are also disturbances everywhere for the administration to eliminate and unevennesses to even out. In recent years, the government has withdrawn more and more from the business; whereas it was previously agreed that around 40,000 bouws would be planted, at present only just over 11,000 bouws are still being ordered, and the factories are planting around 30,000 bouws themselves. The necessary land is leased to them by the government, and the workers for the field and factory work are recruited without difficulty through the mediation of the local village chiefs on the basis of prescribed labor contracts. Undoubtedly, a certain amount of "douce violence" will be involved, which no one will condemn outright, provided that it is practiced with justice. For the year 1890, the direct revenue from sugar plantations is estimated at 1,321,223 guilders, and it appears that a large number of factories are working to good advantage, as they are meeting their obligations to the government very punctually. Cinchona bark. The cultivation of cinchona bark is very much looked after by the Government, but is making only moderate progress, in spite of great expense and expenditure on the maintenance of the plantations; at any rate the financial gain is quite insignificant. Cinchona bark is grown in West Java, specifically in the Preang regencies. In recent years, the harvest has amounted to around 350000 kg per year, which is sold in the Netherlands except for a small amount to the Indian military hospitals. The annual net profit for the government is just over 100,000 guilders. For the year 1890, the retto income is estimated at 22,2750 guilders, and the harvest yield at 450,000 kg. Tin. The yield from the tin mines on Banka provides the government with a large income, while the mines on Billiton are leased to a privileged company for 3 percent of the yield, which does excellent business. The mines on the 13050 gkm island, located in the Sunda Archipelago east of Sumatra, are partly exploited by the government itself and partly leased to Chinese entrepreneurs who supply the tin to the government for a certain price. The government mines are the larger ones; there are currently 97 in operation with a workforce of over 6500. The number of small mines leased to private entrepreneurs is about 700, employing less than 1800 workers. The majority of the workers are Chinese who are recruited in China for a premium of 30 to 40 dollars. The procedure is that these foreigners should be of different origins if possible, so that their tendency towards conspiracy and rebellion is prevented. The most popular, because they are peace-loving and hard-working, are the Pakka Chinese, who are gladly granted the highest premium of 40 dollars on recruitment, followed by the Haquam Chinese, who receive the usual premium of 30 dollars; the Lutjiu Chinese are less pleasant. The total yield of the mines on Banka for the last 5 years of operation was as follows: 1884/85 74510 picolo 1885/86 75 552 1886/87 77050 1887/8 84397 1888/89 65964 For this the government spends about 25 to 30 guilders per picol; the private entrepreneurs even receive only 13.50 guilders per picol in the interior of the island, and in the district of the capital Membok 10 guilders. On average, a net profit of over 55 guilders is made per picol. In 1887/88, for example, the expenses in India amounted to 150 guilders in 1898, plus the costs for transportation to the Netherlands, and the sales charges to the privileged Handels=Maatschappij amounted to 308378 guilders, making a total of 2,206,528 guilders per picol at a cost price of 26.14". In the operating year 1881/89 the relevant figures were 1701669 guilders in India, 239 241 transportation costs and selling expenses, or a cost price per picol of 29.42" guilders. This expenditure includes all expenses connected with the operation of the mine and the considerable costs

 for transportation and sales expenses benefit Dutch citizens. For the operating year 1889/90, only 58,000 picols with 5,143,598 guilders and a total of 145,292 guilders or 5,288,890 guilders in rental income from the mines on Billiton have been set aside. The yield will probably be higher, however, as the year 1888/89 was already an extremely unfavorable one with 65,964 picols. In the months of May, June and July, little work could be done due to a lack of water, and the workers were also plagued by a nasty case of Verriber's disease. At times, 25 percent of the entire workforce was under medical treatment for this nasty disease, but the number of sufferers was far higher, as most sick people only seek treatment when it becomes impossible for them to continue working. Almost 202 workers, or about 3 percent of the entire workforce, died of the disease in the year of operation. As the disease was on the decline towards the end of the old operating year, this disruption is unlikely to recur in the new one. We must now touch on the mining operations on Billiton, Banka's neighboring island of 6652 gkm, which is exclusively in the hands of Billiton=Maatschappij, so that we can make an interesting comparison between state and private operations. The company currently has close to 100 mines in operation and employs just over 7200 workers, most of whom are recruited for mining in China. The mines on Billiton are far less productive than those on Banka, but in view of the smaller number of mines and workers employed, the company's earnings significantly exceed those of the state-owned company. The following quantities of tin were exported in the last five years of operation. 1884/85 61 357 picols from 85 mines with 5 300 workers 1885/86 5152 560 1886/87 89 193 5600 1888/89 77840 7200 1889/90 79 193 7200 The average production of the five years is therefore 71 327 picols, that of Banka calculated for the same period and with an increase of 1000 workers 75 702 picols. Considering the number of workers, the production in Banka should have amounted to more than 81500 picols, disregarding the greater wealth of the mines. In this case, therefore, it can be shown that the state-owned company operates much more expensively than the private company. The entire production of Billiton is sold in Batavia, only the 3 percent of the net profit as rent is sent to the Netherlands and sold there for the account of the government through the intermediary of the privileged Handels=Maatschappij. In the 1888/89 operating year, the company sold 84,182 picols in Batavia at an average price per picol of 63½ fl., i.e. the considerable sum of 5345,547 fl. from the sale of one year, although the operating costs are probably less than they are for Banka because the freight charges to the Netherlands are no longer applicable. Dr. H. Bokemeyer. (Conclusion follows.) Colonial pathology. The medical profession has followed colonial policy and created colonial pathology. An expert authority in this new branch of medicine, Professor Stockvis (Amsterdam), spoke about the highly interesting questions of his discipline at the recent medical congress in Verlin as follows: As one of the most important tasks of the research field of colonial pathology, the speaker described the decision of the question of whether and to what extent an adaptation of the European to the tropical climate is possible through the inheritance of acquired characteristics and whether the native shows a greater resistance to the diseases prevailing in tropical climates than the European; Furthermore, "colonial pathology" has the task of investigating the causes underlying the diseases that are particularly prevalent in tropical countries, or of indicating ways and means of eliminating these causal factors. In order to bring the questions and problems under discussion closer to their solution, there is no better material than the morbidity and mortality statistics of the European troops stationed in tropical countries, in particular those stationed by Holland in its East Indian possessions and those maintained by the British in British India. The mortality rates of these troops, which also include regiments recruited from natives and commanded by Europeans and which, since natives and Europeans live under the same conditions in these troops, provide excellent material for comparative statistics - there are statistical findings on the mortality rates of these troops that go back to the beginning of our century. The statistics, as carried out on behalf of the Colonial Department of the Dutch government and as provided by the British Indian and Colonial Office for scientific research, form the basis of the remarkable conclusions that Redner reached in his investigations in order to answer the above questions. According to Redner, there were two dangers that threatened the life of Europeans living in the tropics, namely 1. the peculiar thermal conditions of these regions and 2. the infectious diseases prevalent there. But if it was recently assumed, and to some extent is still assumed, that the European is under no circumstances equal to the climatic conditions of the tropics, and that the native has a greater capacity for resistance than the European living in the tropics, this is one of those unproven assertions to which the French sentence applies: "Il n'y a pas une vérité scientifique, qui dure plus qu'un siècle". The very fact that the European in his native country has accustomed his organism to very different degrees of temperature during the seasons of the year, which show considerable differences in temperature, and that those centers of the brain which are responsible for the sensation of heat (thermal centers) are excellently trained for it, This fact alone makes it very unlikely from the outset that the European cannot live in the tropics, where he becomes a "manic summer man", so to speak, in the long run. In fact, the statistics leave no doubt that the European has a very considerable resistance to the sudden changes of temperature which occur so frequently in the tropics, and that he is far less frequently afflicted by catarrhal diseases caused by sudden changes of temperature than the colored man; There are also certain diseases, such as hepatitis (inflammation of the leather), which occur twice as frequently among the natives of tropical countries as among Europeans, and certain epidemics, such as measles, smallpox, influenza, etc., occur more frequently in the former than in the latter. etc. occur in the former in a much more dangerous form than in the European. If, on the other hand, the native is not afflicted by tropical fevers (malaria and the like) quite as frequently as the European living within the tropics, Redner considered it highly questionable whether this fact should be interpreted as an adaptation to the climate. The main explanation for this fact is rather the fact that the native generally keeps away from the consumption of spirits. To anyone who examines the above statistics in detail, the old doctrine that Europeans are incapable of adapting to the climatic conditions of tropical countries must appear to be completely absurd and untenable. Of course, we see from these statistics that in the majority of settlements founded by Europeans in tropical countries, the mortality of the troops stationed there during the first decades of colonization is, as a rule, considerable; on the other hand, however, these statistics also prove that the said mortality decreases from year to year and that in the majority of non-European possessions of European peoples it hardly differs from the mortality of troops stationed in Europe or from the general mortality of European countries. Since the beginning of this century, the mortality of the troops stationed in the Dutch Indies and British India has fallen to one-sixth or even one-eighth of what it was originally, thus providing unequivocal proof that the initially very high mortality of the colonial troops was not due to a lack of resistance on the part of the Europeans, but rather only to the fact that those hygienic facilities (procurement of good drinking water, construction of healthy dwellings, drainage of swampy terrain and the like), which have recently changed the health conditions of the English and Dutch regiments stationed in tropical countries in such an extraordinarily favorable way, were initially lacking in the settlements in question. This is the only explanation for the fact that the health conditions of the English and Dutch regiments stationed in tropical countries have been changed in such an extraordinarily favorable manner. This is the only explanation for the fact that in countries where the troop mortality rate used to be 130 per

Page 217

The mortality rate on the island of Jamaica, formerly notorious as a "fever's nest", is now only 22 per 1000 per annum - i.e. almost exactly the same as the current average mortality rate of the population of Prussia - while on Curaçao (West Indies) only 18 per 1000 of the troops there die annually, and on Java and Madura 31 per 1000 - which is about the same mortality rate as in Spain and less than in Hungary. It has also been established in the southern states of North America that there is no difference between the mortality of the Negro regiments stationed there and that of the white regiments. Furthermore, if it has been asserted that Europeans show certain differences among themselves in their ability to adapt to the tropical climate, that northern Europeans are less resistant to the climatic conditions of the tropics than southern Europeans, one need only look at the Danish, English, Dutch, French and Spanish colonies located in the Caraibian Sea, in the Greater and Lesser Antilles, to see immediately that they are less resistant to the climatic conditions of the tropics, French and Spanish colonies in the Caraibbean Sea to recognize immediately that these five different nationalities thrive equally well there under equally favourable external conditions, which then leads to the conclusion that the above-mentioned statement about the difference between northern and southern Europeans in their behaviour towards the influences of the tropical climate must be relegated to the realm of those legends that unfortunately all too often find their way into science. As far as malaria in particular is concerned, the speaker emphasized that this disease does not occur more frequently among the white troops in the Dutch East Indies than among the native regiments there, that it is currently one of the rarest diseases in British India, and that cholera and dysentery have also declined very significantly in Dutch and British India. The conclusion of Stockvis's lecture, which was one of the highlights of the congress, was an enthusiastic appeal to the peoples of Europe, in which the latter were called upon to continue their efforts to develop the tropical countries in order to "increase the importance and prosperity of their own nation in those countries where a wonderful field of work opens up to the adult, healthy European, and thus at the same time to render a service to the culture of mankind". Correspondence. From Vorneo. As the conditions and population of the interior of Borneo are rarely reported to the public, it may be of interest to our readers to receive a brief sketch of them in the following. This has been made available to us by the German Sunda Society (Dresden, Rietschelstrasse 13) and is taken from a letter from its technical director, Mr. Parizot, who was on a trip to the tobacco plantations to be established by the Society. He writes, among other things: "I left Bansermassin on the Iris, a small steam launch belonging to a European company there, which has been operating the connection between the Mariapura, Barito and Negara for about 2 months. First we went up the Martapura (on which Bansermassin lies), then into the Barito as far as Fort Marahaban, where the Regara flows into the Barito. Entering the former, I was struck by the contrast between its banks and those of the Barito. Those of the latter are desolate, monotonous and barren, those of the Negara are densely fringed by sago palms; stately native villages, built on planks, alternate with vast rice fields, on whose lush green color the eye likes to rub; every so often, mighty jungle pops up, in places reaching down to the river. The river is populated by hundreds of smaller and larger barges, used for fishing or trading. At 7 o'clock in the evening we reached the village of Margasarie, where our boat moored for the night. I wouldn't have been able to protect myself against the billions of mosquitoes on board, so I looked for shelter on land and found it in an empty, half-ruined hut. Here, too, I was besieged by hordes of the bloodthirsty insects, but with the help of an improvised mosquito net and wood fires that burned throughout the night and filled the house with idyllic smoke, I managed to escape, albeit half maltreated. The next morning we set off at daybreak and arrived in Negara at 12 noon. The town, which has about 30,000 inhabitants, consists of a long row of houses on each side of the river. To cover the whole length, from one end to the other, it took us about 1½ hours, steaming at a moderate pace. The rapid increase in population indicates a particular fertility of the race, as there is no immigration. In front of every house there was a house of children who watched us intently. As soon as our boat approached, the young men - all naked - rushed into the boat, which seems to be as much a part of the inventory of every house here as the house key is in Eurova, and rocked themselves with delight in the small waves caused by our propeller. If the light boat was overturned, which happened at home, there was general rejoicing, to which those who had fallen into the water joined in loudly. Negara has been famous for centuries for its iron and copper industry. The blades and spears made here enjoy a good reputation throughout the archipelago and are expensive, but far more rewarding for the Negara craftsmen is the production of copper coins. To explain the final sentence, I add that the copper coins formerly legal here (since the times of the Dutch Company) were the duites, 120 of which were equal to a silver florin. For ten years or more, the government has allowed the duits to be withdrawn from circulation. The latter only likes and wants copper cents (100 - f 1) but the population, which is very conservative on this point, does not want its beloved duits at all. The formerly existing supply of duite would soon or already have disappeared, since the import of duite has completely ceased, if the Regara copper smiths had not met the general need by minting duite. By keeping them in the ground for a long time and vigorously rubbing them down with sand, the product is given the appearance of old coins, and the people, although they know exactly where this money comes from, take it willingly, while they reject the good coins with contempt, or at least only accept them with reluctance. But the manufacturers make a colossal profit from this work, for the 120 duits, I am told, require no more than 27 duits in material and manufacturing costs. I would have liked to take a closer look at this industry, but the Jris steamed on again after a quarter of an hour. A few hours later, the riverbanks become noticeably higher. The vegetation already indicates this, as the sago palm, which thrives best in the swamp, has given way to the coconut palm, which requires fairly dry soil. More and more villages appear, eventually forming an unbroken row that lasts for hours as far as Amoenthay, the houses framed by dense bamboo bushes and all kinds of fruit trees, just like on Java. At 5 o'clock we landed in Amoenthay, where I was given an apartment through the intermediary of the Assistant Resident; I always sent Mr. V., an official of the company, ahead to Tandjong to rent or buy some houses for us from the natives. With regard to Amoenthay, I have to mention that there is a fort there with a garrison of 150 men under the command of a captain and two lieutenants. The population is well-to-do, and a part of it can be called rich by local standards. The population of the entire department, including Negara and Barabay, is well over 400,000. In the years 1859-61, the region was the scene of a bloody uprising, which had to be suppressed by a considerable force of troops. After the suppression of the uprising, the administration was organized militarily and remained so for several years. The officers concerned, who at the same time acted as civil officials, instilled discipline and order, which were previously unknown to the population, with iron rigor and thus had a highly beneficial effect. Roads, which had not existed at all until then, were built in large quantities, and so excellently that they would still be usable after 30 years if the bridges still existed. I covered the distance from Amoenthay to Tandjong in a boat manned by 7 oarsmen in 11 hours; on horseback it would hardly take 3-4 hours. In Tandjong I was very kindly received by the local inspector, Mr. van der Hout, who readily promised me his help in procuring workers, etc., which he also did. The most remarkable thing is that there is a fort here with a garrison of 50 men; it is certainly touching to have military protection so close to our lands, although there is nothing to fear. The local population is extraordinarily good-natured and amiable, but is also very particular about good treatment and will easily take revenge with a lance if you do not respect this side of their character. From here, I always found the officials ahead of us to lay out the most necessary bamboo houses and paths; this was done after two days, and I then went there myself. In a further report, Mr. Gustav Parizot describes the extraordinary fertility, the good irrigation and the relatively good climate of the area and reports that he has easily managed to get enough workers, that he has laid out the seedbeds and certainly hopes to be able to deliver a test harvest this year. According to Director Parizot, who had the opportunity to get to know the tobacco grown in Amoenthay last year, Borneo tobacco has an extraordinary future, an assumption that is also becoming more and more widespread in other circles. News from the Society. We would like to inform you of the very rich and interesting program of the Northwest German Trade and Industry Exhibition in Bremen, and, following on from our announcements in the previous issue, we hope that many members will decide to visit the exhibition together. We recommend the days of September 5, 6 and 7 for your visit.

 - Of the departments of our Society in which there has been a major increase in new members in recent months, the following should be mentioned in particular: Altenburg (increase of 59 members); Antwerp (193); Augsburg (33); Bamberg (15); Bromberg (13); Crefeld (90); Darmstadt (16); Flensburg (64); Hanover (41); Iserlohn (52); Cologne (67); Löbau (32); Magdeburg (68); Meiningen (26); Mülheim a. d. R. (101): Osnabrück (61); Quedlinburg (50); Ruhrort (33); Wesel (42). We have to thank the friends who represent our cause in the above-mentioned departments as board members for this great success, in addition to the steadily growing importance that is becoming apparent in all colonial matters. We would also like to take this opportunity to thank them most sincerely for their dedicated work in the service of colonial endeavors. In the first half of the year, we gained a total of 27 new departments, some with very significant membership, which we list again in the context and chronological order of their formation: Antwerp, founded 1. I.; Bensheim, founded 13. I.; Wernigerode, founded 20 l., Ebingen, est. 21. l.; Bernburg, est. 29. 1.; Oberfrohna, est. 1. II.; Quedlinburg, est. 3. II.; Oonabrück, est. 4. 1I.; Torgau, est. 8. 1I.Löbau, est. 8. II.; Gumbinnen, est. 11. II.; Saargemünd, est. 14. II.; Mülheim a. d. Ruhr, est. 19. II.; Dirschau, est. 26. II.; Wetzlar, est. 7. III; Sondershausen, est. 13. III; Leiönig, est. 22. III; Iserlohn, est. 28. III; Altenburg, est. 11. IV; Gütersloh, est. in April; Annaberg, est. 12. V.; Crefeld, founded 13. V.; Flensburg, founded 17. V Essen, founded 28. V.; Ruhrort, founded 28. VI.; Lübeck, founded 26. VI.; Wesel, founded in August. We are also pleased to take this opportunity to bear witness to the fact that Germans abroad have recently been following the work of our Society with keen interest and that in many important places where a number of friends have come together, a representative is in constant contact with the Society's central management. In this way we can best fulfill our task of establishing and consolidating closer relations between Germans living abroad and the colonial circles of the mother country for the benefit and promotion of the general interests of German trade and overseas business. - Bayrenth Department. Mr. Proviantmeister Illich of the Wißmann troop, who came here on leave at the end of April after having been in East Africa for two years without interruption and having taken part in the various battles of the Schutztruppe, was a regular visitor to our club evenings during his stay. His simple and unpretentious way of telling his story captivated all the members so much that everyone listened to him with rapt attention. Before his arrival, Mr. Jllich had already sent his father a rich collection of East African weapons and equipment. Under persuasion, Mr. Jllich agreed to exhibit these objects publicly for a few days. The collection was very well attended (1492 paying visitors), and although only a very small entrance fee was charged (soldiers were completely free), the net proceeds amounted to 223 marks. It is to be considered a great gain that the interest in our cause has thus reached wider circles and that, above all, people who are far removed from colonial politics can form an opinion about the conditions and the spiritual talents of the East African peoples through the presentation of collections. On July 20, a small farewell was celebrated for Mr. Jllich at Uhren. On this occasion, our board of directors, Mr. Lunz, the district judge, wished Mr. Jllich all the best for his journey with the wish that in a few years' time Mr. J. would be back in our midst as healthy as he is now. At the same time, Mr. J. was presented with a small gift (a hunting knife) as a memento. - On the 23rd, Mr. J. embarked on his second voyage to East Africa with Soliman den Nasr on the first ship of our new line. - The Fleusburg department held its first lecture evening on August 8. The subject of the very instructive and entertaining lecture was Samoa, which the lecturer knew from his own experience. After the lecture, which was received with great applause, the members stayed together for a long time. Various views of our colonies and an extremely tasteful coat of arms of our province were presented to decorate the club room, for which the department expresses its thanks to the gentlemen concerned. Small announcements. - (Dr. Peters) will arrive here at Anhalter Bahnhof on Saturday, August 23rd, 12 noon, according to a telegram that arrived here from Milan on August 16th. A committee meeting will take place on the 25th at 4 o'clock in the afternoon in the rooms of the Kaiserhof, the agenda of which is as follows: 1. welcoming Dr. Peters and receiving his oral report, 2. passing a resolution on the discharge of the executive committee and the possible dissolution of the committee. The meeting will be followed at 6 o'clock by a banquet in the rooms of the Kaiserhof in honour of Dr. Peters and his comrades, which will be attended by the Board and the departments of the German Colonial Society (The "Nationalzig." will publish two reports from German East Africa, from Moschi on June 6 and from Tarume on June 24. The reports deal with the journey of Dr. Baumann, who has been commissioned by the German East African Society with the topographical survey of Usambara and with preliminary studies for a railroad to Kilimanjaro. In the first report, Mr. Baumann informs us that his expedition consists of himself and 56 men. Four men were discharged ill in the course of the journey and were sent to the coast with their rifles, four men (including three with rifles) deserted in the first few days, two (a missionary pupil from Magila and a soldier from the Shuetruppe) ran away later. Mr. Baumann's comments on the railroad issue are, as he himself says, only superficial. He then continues verbatim: "The route Tanga=Bondei presents no difficulties. From there, there are two possibilities, one through the steppes north of Usambara to a point on the eastern edge of South Pares (the most favorable will be provided by my Ardites), the other through the Pangani and Mkomasithal. The nearer route offers advantages with regard to the customs border, but leads mostly through deserts and the descent of Usambara is steep. The second route leads through cultivated land and offers easy access to the interior of Usambara. From the eastern edge of Pare, the line could be extended to Taveta or Arusha. There are no serious terrain difficulties anywhere in these plains. Water is also available everywhere or can be obtained by piping in riverbeds and short pipelines. A tremendous reduction in costs could be achieved if forced, unpaid labor were to be introduced. - A letter from Emin Pasha to relatives in Berlin arrived from Mywapwa, the well-known German station in Usagara, dated June 5 of this year. Emin was on his way to the lake district, taking great care and concern for the expedition entrusted to his leadership. He described the banks of the Victoria-Nyansa as his destination, where he would have to stay for some time. - Lieutenant von Arnim of the Wißmann debris troop, chief of Saadani, died there of dysentery on August 6, according to a report that arrived. He was only 26 years old, had joined the rifle troops on his own initiative and had reached East Africa in December 1889. - In Kilwa everything is quiet so far, but the people do not return, but remain in the interior; only when the fort is completed can larger expeditions be undertaken. Chief von Zelewski is trying everything possible to make the people confidential and move to the coast, but so far without success - (On the occasion of the new steamer connection) with East Africa, it is of great interest to take a look at the current state of Hamburg's trade with Africa on the basis of the work "Hamburgs Handel und Verkebr in 1889", which has just been published by the Hamburg Trade Statistics Bureau. The pleasing fact is that imports from both East Africa and West Africa have been steadily increasing since 1886, when a severe depression had set in everywhere as a result of unfavorable trading conditions. In East Africa, the increase has been very slow due to the lack of a dominant export item; it has risen from 11,142,220 marks in 1886 to 1,738,750 marks in 1889, a very insignificant fraction of the entire Zanzibari trade. The export of Zanzibar can be estimated at about 30 million marks, the import at some 20 million marks; if Germany only takes part in the export with not quite two million, this can only be explained by the lack of a suitable shipping connection; most of the goods go to London and Marseilles, the ivory seeks out the English market, the olive fruits go to Marseilles to be imported to Germany as "genuine" Provençal oil, and even the cloves (the export of Zanzibar and Pemba amounts to an average of 3 million marks per year!) were only brought directly to Hamburg to a very small extent (in 1888 for 189,160 marks, in 1889 for 343,150 marks). The steamship line will certainly bring about a salutary change here. The Hamburg import companies are also preparing to take advantage of the favorable opportunity; a new company is being formed there to pursue commercial purposes in Africa. The import tables from West Africa, on the other hand, provide a completely different picture. Imports have increased from 9223 360 marks in 1886 to 14 841 200 marks in 1888 and 19 786 110 marks in 1889! The traffic has become so significant that the number of steamships carrying the West African trade had to be increased. The increase in trade is particularly noticeable in palm kernels, which rose from 5,588,540 marks in 1886 to 11,675,370 marks in 1889. There was also a lively increase in cash, rubber and palm oil. This pleasing upswing in West African trade is an eloquent argument for the acquisition of colonies, as Togo and Cameroon have contributed to the increase in no small measure. As is well known, the Hamburg companies have their main business in the two German colonies, while the Bremen companies, which are of course not included in the Hamburg statistics, are domiciled in Togo. - We also understand that negotiations are underway to change the timetable of the German East African line so that, in addition to Tanga, one of the southern ports (South West Africa) will also be called at regularly. Mr. E. Hermann, who as an official of the German Colonial Society for South West Africa administered the Lüderitzbucht (Angra Pequena) station and is known to our readers through his reports on

Page 219

Groß Namaqualand, has, after spending some time in Germany, now returned to South West Africa in the service of the aforementioned colonial company, namely as its general representative. In future, he will take up permanent residence in Betbania and set up an agricultural research station in the area, which, if the results are favorable, will serve as a starting point for German settlement in Greater Namaqualand. (According to the "Deutsches Kolonialblatt", 105 whites live in the Schuzgediet Kamerun. Among them are 65 Germans. 23 Englishmen. Austrians, 2 Australians, 2 Russians, 1 Spaniard, 1 American and 10 Swedes. - Dr. Zintgraff will return to his field of activity in West Africa (Togo region) in the near future, after he has recovered sufficiently. The planter Goldberg, who has been commissioned to carry out experiments with cotton culture in the Togo region, arrived in Klein Popo on June 21 of this year. The botanist Dr. Richard Büttner, assigned as a scientific member of the Bismarcksburg station, arrived in Klein Popo on June 21 of this year, according to the "Kolonialdlatt", and, after sending 40 or 50 porters ahead on June 26 or 30, arrived on July 4 of this year with a cart consisting of 36 heads. The first annual report of the Jaluit Company, with a share capital of 1,200,000 marks, closes with a loss of 17,491 marks. As is well known, the Reich itself has taken over the governmental authority on the Marshall Islands in return for payment of the costs incurred by the Jaluit Company. The business report emphasizes that the government officials had incurred not inconsiderable travel expenses and that the costs of administration in this first year had been exceptionally high. The introduction of the German imperial currency in place of the Chilean and Dolivian dollars would be advantageous in the future, but the transition had demanded considerable sacrifices. However, the purchasing power of the natives has increased significantly, which is not least directly attributable to the ban on the import of water and the sale of spirits to the natives, as the lack of ammunition has stopped the fights of the natives, during which a large number of coconut palms were regularly destroyed, and the lack of spirits has caused the disappearance of the debauched feasts, which interrupted the preparation of copra and all activities of the natives for weeks at a time. (The annual report of the Dresden Chamber of Commerce and Industry for the year 1889) refers several times to colonial policy, especially with regard to the general economic situation. Thus, after a review of the export business, it says: "Even if one may now hope that German industrialists and merchants will succeed in regaining the value lost abroad, it cannot be denied that this will require even more tireless activity and even greater willingness to make sacrifices than before under the existing and, in all probability, in the near future, even stricter customs measures of almost all countries in which German goods find buyers. It is precisely from this point of view, however, that we consider it our duty to point out at this point the extraordinary importance that the possession of its own colonies has for Germany's trade and industry, and to object to the view that, because at present our young colonies not only do not yet provide the mother country with rich returns, but will also in part require great expenditure to secure and develop them for a long time to come, the German Empire should be content with the successes achieved in the year under review and leave further development exclusively to private enterprise. Just as, under the present circumstances, the safeguarding of European peace and thus of the welfare of the people requires of every major state on this continent the undiminished preservation of its military strength, even at the heaviest sacrifices, the acquisition and safeguarding of its own territories for the surplus of domestic production demands no less the continued intervention of the state and the continued granting of the benefits to be imposed by it on the whole for this purpose, and we are convinced that we are speaking in the spirit of the circles we represent when we recognize the colonial policy of the German Reich as being as moderate as it is purposeful. - (Hirsebler.) With reference to the note in No. 13 of the "KolonlalZeitung", Hermann Barth, Hölonan (Agppten), wrote us the following: "Two years ago I brewed millet, corn and rice beer near Alexandria for my own and one of my friends' domestic use. At first I tried to brew beer from corn using bottom fermentation and achieved a brilliant, crisp drink that was not dissimilar to Pilsener beer. The Reisdier, on the other hand, was not at all to my liking when underfermented, nor was the underfermented Hirjedier. Things turned out quite differently when I made the latter using my own method with top fermentation. J. achieved a drink with an outside air temperature of 35 to 38 degrees Celsius in the shade, without ice, which was completely equal to the Berlin wheat beer in terms of flavor and mousseux. If you now consider that my brewhouse, my fermenting and storage cellar, my malting plant, in short - my entire brewery was a small washhouse, you can safely assume that with a cheap facility with a small ice machine, a beer can be produced that will meet with universal acclaim. One difficulty for the brewer in the tropics is the yeast. During my work as a master brewer in the French brewery in Cairo, I usually found one of the four consignments of yeast that I needed. This gave me the idea of sending the yeast in tins I had constructed, which was a complete success. As far as the cost of a brewery facility for millet beer is concerned, I know too little about freight and customs rates for German East Africa and therefore make the estimate for Egyptian conditions. A small installation according to my system, together with a small ice machine, crockery, etc., will cost about 15,000 marks when assembled in Cairo. The building and apartment for the brewer could be produced in Egypt for 10,000 marks. Entrances for the library. Given the limited space we have for book reviews, it will not be possible to discuss all works in detail, but we never fail to recommend new colonial writings, which are assigned to our library by the authors and publishers, to colonial friends in word and deed, for which the administration of the library is given ample opportunity by our members. Once again, we would like to express our sincere thanks for the books donated to our library. Receipts in July. a of Herlrakultur.

If not long ago the character of Dr. Carl Peters, distorted by the favor and hatred of the parties, was wavering, if his eulogists had become rare and shy

Page 220

 But the censure, the ridicule and the mockery were bold, so there is hardly anyone now who knows his deeds and does not pay tribute and admiration to this rare man, regardless of whether he is a friend or an enemy of German settlements. To Dr. Carl Peters we owe our great colony "German East Africa", the revival of interest in Germany for overseas settlement, the founding of the German East African and the Plantation Society, the first institutions in German East Africa and now again the fame that our people have gained through his bold and admirable move. In our time, many Germans in Africa have acquired a lasting claim to the gratitude of their ration, and some eternal fame. But no one has pursued his goal against an unprecedented combination of physical and moral obstacles like Peters, and no one has suffered so much bitter injustice from friend and foe alike. He is a model of faithful devotion to duty. As long as courage and steadfastness, as long as duty, honor and conscience still count for something, his name will always remain dear to the Germans. The German people owe it to themselves to offer him an outward sign of gratitude and recognition for his outstanding patriotic work. For this purpose, a collection of contributions shall be organized, and the capital resulting from it shall be used as the "Carl Peters Foundation" for an enterprise of lasting value to promote colonial interests in German East Africa. The choice of enterprise shall be left to Dr. Carl Peters. We hereby call upon all friends of the German colonial cause to contribute to this foundation. 1.

The railroad to Kilimanjaro. The "Reutersche Büreau" has sent us news from Zanzibar which is likely to have serious consequences for the development of trade in the northern part of our protectorate, namely that on August 26, in Mombas, in the presence of the Consul General Evan Smith, the foreign consuls, Admiral Fremantle and numerous Europeans and natives, the ground-breaking ceremony for the railroad to be built to Victoria Nyanza took place. Soon afterwards it was said that the route of the line, which is supposedly to be led to Taweta for the time being, was to be completed in about ten months, and even if this remark was only intended as an advertisement for the company, the mere fact that the construction of the railroad had begun gave much food for thought. For the English, backed by sufficient capital, are pursuing their goal of directing all trade from Victoria Nyanza and further on from Uganda to their ports with admirable perseverance, and if we Germans do not soon make greater efforts to secure our share of the trade there, our efforts will later be incomparably more difficult and less promising. The construction of a railroad to Kilimanjaro has been discussed by the Germans for years; one of the first projects for the development of the hinterland dealt with this question, suggestions were made as to how an interest guarantee from the state could be achieved, calculations upon calculations were made, until the uprising threw these plans overboard and more important matters had to be dealt with for the moment. Soon after the end of the uprising, the Deutsch=Ostafrikanische Gesellschaft again sent an expedition to East Africa to study the question in detail and find a suitable route, and it now seemed that the spell that had been cast on this great project was finally to be broken, after the pros and cons of such a railroad connection had been discussed in detail by experts on the country - we refer to the works of Captain Weiß published in this newspaper - and everything had even been worked out in detail. But the English did not talk for long, but carried out their project, brought the material for the railroad construction to Mombas, secured sufficient manpower and will now, if all is not deceptive, have pushed the line forward to the vicinity of Kilimanjaro in a short time. However, the work will be incomparably more difficult than that of a line from Tanga to Kilimanjaro, as the hinterland of Mombas is a desolate, arid steppe for most of the year, while the hinterland of Tanga and the Usambara Mountains are quite densely populated, at least by East African standards, and therefore fertile. On the other hand, the English line has the advantage of being the shortest to Kilimanjaro, while a line to be laid on German territory has to bypass the Usambara Mountains. There are advantages and disadvantages on both sides, but we are not about to declare that the latter outweigh the former for the English line. The ivory trade on Kilimanjaro itself, which is often counted on, has not been very significant up to now; on the German side, when the railroad to Kilimanjaro was discussed, the main emphasis was placed on having a good and fast connection with the high and healthy regions where Europeans can live longer than usual in the tropics without harming their health. However, precautionary measures will have to be taken to ensure that we do not lose the trade of this region as a result of the English railroad as long as we do not have an equally good connection there. We need not immediately think of erecting a customs cordon in the African bush, but it goes without saying that if the English want to move their first terminus so close to our border, we have a right to take precautions to ensure that our territory does not fall completely under their control in terms of trade policy. One must admit, however, that if the English really want to build a railroad to Biktoria=Nyanza, they are in the predicament of having to run it close to our border, because, as I said, they only have this one route available to them from Mombas Whether they will reach the interior from Taweta is a question that cannot yet be answered today, as completely unpredictable factors come into play here. But when the anti-colonial press repeatedly emphasizes, in order to scare off the capitalists, that building a railroad in East Africa is like taking a leap in the dark, since all the preconditions for a calculation are missing, it is very much mistaken if it wants to apply this assertion generally to the routes up to Kilimanjaro. The Sahara Railway, the transcontinental railroad which is to connect the Portuguese possessions of West and East Africa, are daring speculations, but the risk for the route to Kilimanjaro cannot be remotely compared with that which the capitalist will run on the other railroads. We will not go so far as to calculate everything down to the last penny, but it seems almost comical when the anti-colonial press continues to talk about a "fantastic project" now that the British, who have admirably covered India with a network of railroads, are starting to develop the land in East Africa. The opponents today are the same people as in the past who ridiculed the plan for railroads to Central Asia or across the North American continent, which run through deserts or at least waterless steppes, until the seemingly impossible was made possible. Anyone who allows himself to be dissuaded from the conviction of the necessity of railroad construction in East Africa by such attacks must truly have little understanding of the matter. We consider the railroad to Kilimanjaro to be even more important than the coastal line from Bagamoyo to Dar es=Salaam recommended by Wißmann. For Bagamoyo will and must, and we venture here a prophecy that many may initially accept with disbelief, lose enormously at the expense of Dar es Salaam, the port of call for the steamers, the central customs office of the German East African Company, which will only establish main customs stations in places with good harbors. With the development of coastal steam navigation, the coastal railroad will also be pushed into the background, and as far as the caravans are concerned, so

Page 222

it is in the German interest to direct them from Bagamoyo to Dar es Salaam. The reclamation of the coast and the competition from the English present us with new tasks which are not yet clearly recognizable everywhere. This much is clear, that the railroad question is one of the most important and the anti-colonial press is right in assuming that the efforts of the English will spur us on to new attempts. It would indeed be better if it could be done without the English example, but the history of the Kilimanjaro railroad project shows once again in the clearest possible way how difficult it is for us to realize an idea whose feasibility and practical advantages were obvious from the outset. Once again the Witu area and the Anglo-German treaty. The following remarks in the Weserzeitung are directed against the comments on the above subject contained on page 203 of the Kolonialzeitung: "It is true that the sale of the 25 square miles took place on April 7, 1885, while the German protectorate over Witu was only declared on May 27 of that year at the request of the Sultan. But that act of sale was only the prerequisite for the protectorate to be granted. According to the principles advocated by Prince Bismarck, the German Empire only assumed protectorate over territories where German interests were present. In Witu, however, such interests were completely absent and the Denhardts could therefore only hope for success for their claim if they succeeded in creating them. As they repeatedly stated, this was the main reason why they decided to propose the land deal to the Sultan. Sultan Achmed, on the other hand, fully recognized the correctness of their reasoning and only ceded the valuable large territory to the German travellers because he saw it as the only means of gaining Germany's protection against the violent acts of the Arabs. Most importantly, however, the Denhardt brothers themselves, the purchasers of the territory, regarded it from the outset as also subject to the protection of the German Empire. After all, the purpose of their claim was only to gain the German protectorate and to develop the rich natural resources of the Sultanate under German protection! In response to their various requests, they were always assured of the support of the empire. And the same view was held by the Witu Society, which always considered itself to be under the protection of the German Empire. How often it invoked and was granted the same, and how it fought with the help of the same against both the Denhardt brothers and the Sultan of Witn, is still fresh in the memory. There is also no doubt that the Foreign Office has always had the same view of the situation and would have been astonished if the Company had ever acted as a kind of sovereign in those territories. The more England attaches importance to maintaining a free hand in the tana territories and getting rid of the activities of the Witi Company there, the less Germany will be able to support the claim of the East African Company that is now emerging. The protectorate of Witu has been withdrawn out of consideration for the rightly valued agreement with England and a heavy sacrifice has been made by giving up the good harbor and the river connection to the interior. If the East African Company were now to be granted sovereignty over those 25 square miles, within which the Witu Company has never made any economic investment or taken any measures, on the basis of sophistical legal arguments, this would rightly displease England. The East Africans will therefore have to be content to cultivate their territory in Witn as private individuals." All the facts asserted in that article of the Kolonialzeitung, in particular that the protectorate over the Sultanate of Witu does not include the territory of the Witu Company, that a letter of protection was never issued for the latter territory and that the Reich assumed sovereignty, are thus admitted. The Weserzeitung only disputes the conclusions drawn from these facts. It may be left open whether the act of sale was really the prerequisite for the granting of the protectorate, since the protectorate was only to be assumed for territories where German interests were present. This is completely irrelevant. In fact, a protectorate was only established over the Sultanate of Witu, excluding the territory of the Witu Society. It is also not at all true that protectorates were only established where German interests were present. It is well known that such interests did not yet exist on the mainland of Africa (Usagara, etc.) at the time of the first German seizures of possession. In any case, the Imperial Government is of a different opinion than the Weserzeitung regarding its authority to dispose of the territory of the Witu Company and the status of the territory under international law. The German memorandum, which had not yet been published at the time when the article on the Witu area was written for the Kolonialzeitung, and which therefore could not be referred to, says verbatim: "This enterprise (i.e. Denhardt Bros. and the Witu Company), which has now been taken over by the German East African Company, is based on a tract of land near Kipini on the coast with an alleged area of 25 square miles, which the Sultan of Witu ceded to Clemens Denhardt with all sovereign rights in accordance with the agreement of April 8, 1885. The fact that the agreement with the Great British Government leaves the acquired rights of the German-East African Company completely unaffected need only be mentioned here as a matter of course". The contracting powers have thus taken it for granted that they cannot dispose of the rights of a third party, and that the sovereign rights of the German East African Company over the Witn area remain unaffected. The Weserzeitung thus does not consider the English interest to be sufficiently protected and believes that the Africans must manage their territory in Witu as private individuals. In view of this contradiction, the official memorandum can be given more credence than the Weser newspaper as to what the opposing parties wanted. There is no doubt that the establishment of permanent sovereign rule by a German society was not intended from the outset. In any case, the original intention was to impose sovereignty on the empire and thus establish a German colony, as had been done in Usagara rc. To prove this, the Weser newspaper would not have needed any further deductions. However, the original intention was not realized, and thus the full sovereignty of the German society remained. Finally, if the ability of private individuals and companies to acquire and hold sovereign rights should still be in doubt, it should be pointed out that this power was recognized by both the English government and all parties in the House of Commons when a charter was granted to the North Borneo Company in 1882. Similarly, most states, including England, recognized the establishment of the Association internationale am Kongo. The English government would therefore be contradicting its own earlier actions and declarations if it were now to claim the sovereign rights of the German East African Company over the territory of the former Witu Company. According to the content of the German memorandum, it can also be assumed that the German-East African Association will not lack the support of the German government if, contrary to expectations, these rights are nevertheless contested by England. The German-East African Company thus has the free choice of exercising its sovereignty over the Witu area and exploiting the area economically under its own sovereignty, not "as private individuals", or of ceding the area to England by means of a special international treaty in return for appropriate compensation, which would of course have to be granted in Lano.

Hindorf Anyone who is familiar with the situation in the New Guinea Company and its protectorate, and who has followed and observed the events and changes that have taken place in recent times, will agree with me that the New Guinea enterprise has entered a new stage of development, and that the conditions for the success of the colonization work there are now much richer than before. Of the drastic and momentous changes that have taken place in recent times, two should be mentioned first: Firstly, the transfer of the state administration of the New Guinea Company's territory to the empire, and then the creation of the New Guinea-Surabaya shipping line instead of the former Finschhafen-Cooktown line. The exercise of authority in New Guinea by the upper officials of the New Guinea Company resulted in many difficulties and untenable conditions, and was highly detrimental to the utilization of the land, and the New Guinea Company therefore sought to transfer the state administration of its protectorate to imperial officials in order to be able to devote the entire energies of its own officials to the achievement of economic goals. After a necessary amendment to the statutes had been approved by the Supreme Decree of May 17, 1889, the management of the New Guinea Company soon afterwards reached an agreement with the Foreign Office to the effect that the administration of the country, including the administration of justice and the collection of taxes and customs duties, should be carried out by an imperial commissioner assisted by other officials. The costs of this state administration shall be borne by the New Guinea Company. The management of the Company's affairs

in the protectorate will be taken over by an official of the latter, who bears the title of Director General. This change, which has now been implemented, is of great significance for the development of the colony, all the more so as the New Guinea Company is increasingly expanding its own economic activities. Since the Director General has nothing to do with administrative business as a result of the separation of labor, he will be able to devote his energies all the more extensively to the achievement of purely practical goals; in addition, the Company will be able to take account of the changed requirements when filling the post, as it has done recently, and choose people for it who have been in the midst of practical life in tropical colonies outside and have gained experience here that they can put to good use in New Guinea. The position of the station masters has also changed; most of the administrative business and police powers have been taken away from them, but the company is expected to perform all the more in the economic field. Instead of administrative stations, the aim is to have operational stations; economic success is the foremost goal that every station master has to strive for. The fact that this is now being emphasized so strongly is a significant step forward and will lead to many savings, as well as to the New Guinea Company being able to bring considerable yields from its stations to the market in a short time. At present, however, of even greater importance for the development of the colony is the change that the connection of New Guinea with the rest of the world is now effected by the steamer line Finschhafen-Surabaya instead of via Queensland as hitherto. At first sight it might appear that this is an insignificant change; but with all its consequences it must have a reshaping effect on the whole situation in New Guinea. In the past, in my opinion, a rapid development of New Guinea was hardly to be expected; now, after the connection with Java, it will take a lively upswing. Admittedly, the current state still leaves a lot to be desired, but the foundations have been laid and it is to be hoped that improvements will not be too long in coming. The arrangement is now such that the two steamers of the New Guinea Company have to make the journey from Finschhafen to Surabaya and back alternately every 6 weeks. Of course, this cannot suffice in the long run, because not only do the stations of the New Guinea Company have to be called at and supplied with everything they need, but also the settlers and plantation companies, as well as the missionaries, are dependent on the steamers of the New Guinea Company for all their supplies and shipments. Under the present circumstances, this is a deplorable state of affairs that must necessarily discourage any kind of enterprise in New Guinea. On the one hand, a 6-weekly connection will not be considered sufficient by most entrepreneurs, on the other hand, and this is much more serious, they have no guarantee that the steamers of the New Guinea Company have sufficient space for all shipments, or that the steamers sail regularly at all. I assume that the New Guinea Company has the best of intentions, but it could still find itself in the position of not being able to run its steamships, or accidents could disrupt traffic. And then what! Then suddenly the entrepreneurs are sitting there in New Guinca without any connection with the world, and it is just as impossible for them to make any necessary purchases as it is to ship the harvest, which may be ready for shipment and doomed to perdition. The ventures in New Guinea must be protected from such possibilities. It is not within the scope of my present task to go into the details of how. I will only say this: it is probable that by encouraging the indigenous, Arab or Chinese traders and skippers of the Sunda Islands and Moluccas to extend their voyages to German New Guinea, a remedy can be found in many directions. In general, it seems highly recommendable to me to attract the local colored skippers with their good sailing boats to New Guinea in order to achieve cheaper freight rates for products of lower value, and to have all usable products from those areas bought up with the help of the fard traders and brought to the larger staple places at low prices, In addition, however, we must have a secure, regular, perhaps four-weekly steamer connection between New Guinea and Java or Singapore if we want to count on a number of plantations in New Guinea and ensure that they thrive. Hopefully, however, we will be able to achieve not only this, but better still a direct steamer line Germany=Java=New Guinea, to which the New Guinea Company would certainly be willing to make a corresponding contribution. The only advantage of the connection between New Guinea and Cooktewn in Queensland was that it was the shortest to link New Guinea to the world trade, but it entailed many difficulties and disadvantages which now continue to apply to the connection with Juva. In terms of location, soil conditions, climate and the possibility of plant and animal production, the New Guinea Company's protectorate has much in common with the Sunda Islands and little in common with Queensland, and the natural conditions therefore already urge us to join the Sunda Islands with New Guinea. In many respects, Java must serve as a model for New Guinea; like the latter, it will become a pure plantation colony. In Java we will find the seed and planting material for our plantations in New Guinea, as well as the animals for breeding and work; in Java our planters can get to know all the advances in the field of tropical agriculture, and it is therefore of great value for New Guinea to be in easy contact with the most advanced tropical colony. But the greatest advantage that the connection with Java has brought us lies in the fact that it is now much easier to obtain the necessary manpower for the protected area. Everyone who knows the conditions in New Guinea agrees with me that a large-scale plantation operation in New Guinea is only possible with the help of imported workers, as the number of natives is far from sufficient. While it used to be very costly and difficult to bring colored workers to New Guinea via Cooktown, it has now become much cheaper and easier for us, with the direct linking of New Guinea with Java, to get colored people for the heavy work, be they of Malavian origin. Cdinesians or Jndians. And this also effectively prevents the Anglicization of our German possessions; the so-called Pigeon-Engliih dat, because many of the Ardites from the Bismarck Archipelago and the Solomon Islands have previously been to Samoa and other places and have learned some English there, has unfortunately reached quite a large extent in our area of operations. The most effective way of combating this is to introduce large numbers of Malay-speaking workers, for Malay has so far triumphed as the lingua franca of the colored people wherever it has been introduced by workers; and I think it must be our main concern to keep English out of our colonies as much as possible. Incidentally, the recruitment of workers in the protectorate itself has also made gratifying progress. Whereas in the past the natives of New Guinea were unwilling to commit themselves to regular work and only inhabitants of the Bismarck Archipelago and the Solomon Islands entered into a permanent employment relationship with the Europhiles, in recent times it has been possible to recruit people from the area around Finschhafen in larger numbers and for longer periods of time into the service of the New Guinea Company. They are taken to other stations because experience has shown that they only become good and always willing workers far from home, and they have always returned home satisfied at the end of their term of service. In the Bismarck Archipelago and on the Solomon Islands, too, several hundred Ardites have happily rejoined the company for three years within a very short time, so that the company is now able to expand its cultural work further. According to the reports received, new workers will also be available in the future; the company has entrusted the head of the station in the Bismarck Archipelago with the recruitment of workers and intends to set up a workers' depot there. This officer has acquired a great familiarity with the natives and with all conditions through years of residence in the island territories there; and since the company has now had a new sailing schooner built in Sydney, which is intended and equipped exclusively for the purposes of worker recruitment and promotion, recruitment will be able to be pursued all the more eagerly and successfully in the future, and it is to be hoped for a considerable number of good and cheap workers, for a regular replacement of the people leaving at the end of their term of service. and a gradual increase in the number of permanent workers can be counted on with certainty: a success that must indeed be rated extremely highly. Nevertheless, it will not be possible to avoid bringing in other colored Ardites from abroad as soon as some larger plantations are started; but the way has been paved for this through the connection with Java. The results of the Andau trials in New Guinea so far have been so extraordinarily favorable that not only will the New Guinea Company considerably increase its plantations in the near future, but extensive plantations are also being planned by others. The tadak and cotton from New Guinea have met with a favorable assessment and good prices on the Bremen market, and since the harvests have also been satisfactory in other directions, the New Guinea Company will initially transfer a far greater number of workers to its tadak plantations in Hatzfeldthafen and Stephansort, as well as to the cotton plantations in Finschdafen, Constantinhafen and Butaueng, for the cultivation of tobacco and cotton than has been the case to date. The recent formation of a Neu-Gulnea Kalao Company is also to be welcomed with great pleasure. This company, based in Hambura, will use capital of 900,000 marks to initially grow cocoa and later also cash crops; preparations have already been made to a large extent, so that the first plantations will be started by the end of the year. A second tobacco-growing company is to be set up soon. The New Guinea Company is participating in these undertakings by giving up the land free of charge in return for a number of share certificates. I would like to take this opportunity to mention that the surveying and mapping of the land, initially in the vicinity of the stations, is continuing diligently, and that the compilation of land registers and the entries in them have begun. The great value of New Guinea lies solely in the possibility of an extensive tropical plantation, and the focus of its development lies in exploiting this possibility. It has been repeatedly stated, especially in recent times, that Africa must not be won for us through hankering alone, but much more through agriculture and must be kept permanently usable. Even if our African possessions can be opened up to us through these pagan means together, and New Guinea initially only through agriculture, New Guinea has the other advantage that it is better suited to us in terms of soil quality, rainfall distribution and weather conditions. In terms of soil composition, elevation, rainfall distribution and general weather conditions, it has more favorable conditions for planting than any of our other colonies; and now that labor conditions have also improved considerably, I believe that the colony will flourish quickly. On the individual stations, the ongoing work, such as felling and clearing the forest, tilling the fields, building roads, houses, barns, etc., has made good progress. About the cultivation

Page 224

 and the harvests of foodstuffs for the farm workers, the reports are favorable with few exceptions, so that feeding them is becoming cheaper and cheaper. The consumption of canned food of all kinds is gradually decreasing, proof that the stations are taking more and more of their food requirements from the land itself. Livestock breeding is being practiced everywhere with great success. The relationship between the stations and the natives is very good everywhere, with the exception of Hatzfeldthafen, where the previous friction and hostilities have broken out anew. In the Bismarck Archipelago, especially in New Mecklenburg, there have, as is well known, been more serious domestic disputes between the white settlers who have settled there and the natives. Recently, the cruiser corvette Alexandrine had to intervene to punish the offenders and the villages concerned. She also undertook a tour of the entire protectorate and visited all the stations. A Dutch warship also visited Finichhafen on the orders of the Governor General of Dutch India. One can see that our neighbors there are also taking more and more interest in our work in New Guinea; and I believe that the connection with Surabava is also having a positive effect, as New Guinea is now more in the sights of people who have invested their capital in the Indian island kingdom, so that New Guinea will find more consideration in new ventures of this kind in the areas there than was previously the case with the connection via Cockewn. Work is continuing to open up the country more and more, and larger or smaller expeditions have been undertaken from more medieval stations to further explore the surrounding country, especially to examine the land for its suitability for planting and to enter into closer contact with the natives who live further away. One must be surprised, however, that so little has been done to penetrate the high mountains, and that no one is working more diligently towards the establishment of health stations or in the mountains, and that no one is looking for suitable places for such stations. The Solomon Islands have recently been visited several times by the Company's ships, both to get to know this group better and especially to recruit workers among the strong and well-developed indigenous people. The Rhaetian Missionary Society in Barmen, which already has two mission stations in Kaiter=Wildelmsland, also intends to set up another station on the Solomon Islands. The various mission stations in the Bismarck Archipelago have been joined by a new branch of Catholic Salzburg missionaries. The picture I have given you of the development of conditions in New Guinea is a very pleasing one; for everywhere we see lively activity, everywhere progress, everywhere prospects for a successful further development. But it is natural that some things are not as they should be. The course of development has been an extremely slow one, although the company has made heavy sacrifices in order to bring the colony to prosperity quickly. Many ventures and attempts to help develop the colony have failed; the company has suffered many losses, experienced many disappointments, and probably made many a mistake. But nevertheless, everyone will gladly recognize the care and thoroughness with which the New Guinea Company is forging ahead and carrying out all its undertakings, and it therefore deserves the strongest support of the entire nation, so that the difficulties that still lie ahead for the colony's success will be overcome all the sooner. - The great sacrifices already made by the New Guinea Company now seem to be gradually being followed by the blessings they deserve. There is a clear turning point in the history of the New Guinea Company, and the time of sowing seems to be slowly being followed by the time when the company bears fruit. Our beautiful possessions in the South Seas have progressed steadily despite many difficulties. The work that the company has done there has not been easy. All the more reason for us to recognize what has been achieved. It is a great pleasure for me, who know this colony very well and who have come to love it, to be able to report to you, gentlemen, and to summarize my words by saying that the development of conditions in the New Guinea Company's firing area has been a happy one even in recent times, and justifies the highest hopes. On the history and ethnography of the Marshall Islands By H. Seidel. Since the incorporation of the Kaiser=Wilhelm=Land, the Bismarck=, Solomon= and Marshall Islands into German colonial possessions, there has been a lively interest in the development of these oceanic realms everywhere. Under the present rule, research on New Guinea and the neighboring Biomarck Archipelago has been promoted most eagerly, where in earlier times, apart from more or less hasty coastal voyages and a few landings, virtually nothing had happened in terms of exploration. Such work is no longer necessary for the coral structures of the Marshall Group, as most of their modest island formations have long been known, but the unknown ones can easily be visited and explored due to their small size. The literature on the archipelago is already considerable: the old ship books of the Spanish explorers have been joined by the descriptions of Chamisso, Kotedue, Krusenstern, Duperrey and Dana; these were followed by the observations of missionaries, factories, scientific collectors and consuls, and finally the travel reports of the German war steamers, which now often anchor off the reefs. Nevertheless, people still like to linger over the attractive documents from the beginning of the history of discovery. The story of the earliest encounter between the whites and the people of the Marshal Atolls retains its charm from generation to generation and is closely linked to the return of the days that became famous at that time. Perhaps the news of the appearance of a European ship in the Marshal Archipelago goes back to 1526. Around that time, the Spaniard Salazar touched the atoll of Gaspar Rico, far from the main shoal, at 15 degrees north latitude, to which he gave the name San Bartolomeo. Gaspar Rico is the name given to the reef with its eight uninhabited islets by a captain of later years. The actual day of discovery of the Marshall Islands is October 1, 1529, when the Spanish navigator Alvaro de Saavedra anchored at an atoll in the southern row and established the first contact with the natives. Captain Saavedra was on his return voyage from the Moluccas to Mexico. It was the second unsuccessful advance that he undertook in an easterly direction and against the course of the trade winds. At first he laboriously worked his way along the coast of Reuguinea, then steered towards the NE and in this way reached a group of shallow reefs, one of which was four Spanish miles in circumference. Four others, which were also seen, appeared to have no more than one Spanish mile of shoreline each. The islands were inhabited. A can with four or five men pushed off from the beach and approached the ship. The beautifully grown, dark-skinned strangers wore beards and were richly tattooed, which is why Saavedra called the islands "Los Pintados" "the painted ones". The Spaniards believed the natives' address to be a threat, but they attached little importance to it. Their indifference unnerved the islanders, and one of the men hurled a stone at the ship in anger. The stone hit with such force that it tore splinters from a plank in the bulwark. In response, the Spaniards fired a gun, but although the shot was not aimed at the savages, they were so frightened by the noise that they rowed away as quickly as possible and were not seen again. From the latitude recorded for the Pintados, it appears that Saavedra had found a ring of islands from the southern or Ralick range of the Marshall Archipelago. He would soon become acquainted with the northern string or Ratack Atolls. About 80 Spanish miles from the Pintados, a second shoal of low islands appeared in front of the northeast-steering ship. From their anchorage, the Spaniards saw how the natives gathered in droves on the shore to watch the foreign vessel. Their shouts rang loudly across the water; some waved flags, until finally seven canoes were launched and rowed towards the ship. Saavedra had a coat and a comb thrown down, whereupon twenty men and a woman trustingly boarded the ship. The woman seemed to the crew to be a sorceress sent to scout out the mysterious strangers, for she touched each of the white men with her hands. Saavedra treated the natives very kindly, gave them gifts and, when they went home, sent one of his companions ashore with them. The Spaniard was welcomed by the islanders with cheers and led to a large house covered with palm leaves, where the chief lived. The natives here were somewhat lighter in color than the people on the Pintados, but just as colorfully tattooed as those. The women, many of whom were quite pretty, wore long black hair and their mat dresses, which reached from the middle of their bodies almost to their feet. The men wore the usual girdle and carried spears and clubs as weapons. The canoes were all made of driftwood (a type of spruce), which the currents washed up in abundance at certain times of the year. The Ratack islanders still make some of their boats from the same material. As Saavedra found the natives to be so peaceful, he landed with some of his crew to pay the chief a visit. Amid drumming and singing, he was led to the chief's seat, at whose side he sat down. Everyone's attention immediately turned to the Spaniards' firearms, and the chief asked how these weapons were to be handled. When this had been explained to him as well as possible, he wished to see a shotgun fired. He was complied with, but the flash of powder and the noise frightened the islanders so much that they ran away as if possessed, jumped into the canoes, and returned without stopping to the

Page 225

the next island, three Spanish miles away. Only the chief and a few more courageous ones stayed behind at Saavedra. It took a long time before the fugitives calmed down and gained enough safety to venture near the terrible strangers again. As Saavedra had already been suffering for some time - he died on the voyage - he and his ship remained off the island for a whole week. The natives provided the Spaniards with 2000 coconuts, for which the Spaniards showed their gratitude with all kinds of gifts. Fresh water was also procured Saavedra aptly named the lovely islands with their gentle people "Los Buenos Jardines", a name that was echoed three hundred years later in Chamisso's "Gardens of (Wol)lust". For both the first explorers and the scientific researchers of the modern era were captivated by the outward polish, the harmless, good nature of the Marshall Islanders, whose light armament seemed to take the fear out of war. Nor did those vices which disfigured the inhabitants of so many island groups in Oceania appear in the least among them. Saavedra mentions nothing of the indomitable lust for theft, of the shameless fornication which was so common in the Society and Friendship Islands; nothing of the crudeness and animal sense which led the natives of New Caledonia and the Markesas to man-eating. But in spite of all these advantages, some secret bad habits, hidden from foreigners, continued to proliferate among the Marshall Islanders. These included the barbaric custom of murdering all children over three in the families, even burying them alive according to Chamisso, or, where this was not the case, making it impossible to increase the number of children by other reprehensible means. Another peculiar feature of the population was and is the addiction to moving around and constantly changing residence between the different groups, an addiction that forms a serious obstacle to the development of agriculture and commercial activities. The people on the Ralick Islands "are mostly lazy and would rather starve than work", according to a German report from 1881, Spain never took possession of Saavedra's discovery. Indeed, the Marshal Atolls were increasingly forgotten by Spanish seafarers, especially after the Augustinian monk and former Moluccan voyager Andres de Urdanete discovered the much sought-after eastern sea route across the Pacific in 1565. This route went straight from the Philippines in a north-easterly direction up to the 35th parallel and then in this polar hollow right across the uninhabited ocean as far as the Californian shore. This explains the mystery that the Spaniards, depending on the order of the winds, sailed over the northern basin of the South Seas for more than two centuries, leaving the great expeditions of the English, French and Russians to take the main credit for unveiling the Pacific island clouds. After Saavedra's voyage, the Spanish logbooks also have little more to report about the Marshall Islands. From the time of Alvaro Mendana, the last Castilian captain who, according to authenticated reports, sailed over parts of our archipelago in 1568, a full 200 years passed before a European sailor ever set eyes on the lagoon rings between the 5th and 12th parallel. It was as early as 1767 when the English commander Samuel Wallis, Cook's capable predecessor in the South Seas, encountered two of the northernmost groups in the Ratack series on September 3. These were the atolls Rongerick and Rongelab, the latter of which is even more remarkable because Wallis transferred the name of the dubious "Pescadores" of the old maps to it. But it was not until 13 years later, in the summer of 1788, that the Marshall Islands, together with the neighboring Gilbert Archipelago, were explored for the first time on a larger scale and more reliably. This was done by the English merchant captains Gildert and Marshall on the ships "Scarborongh" and "Charlotte". Both captains were currently in the service of the Oft Indian Company, had brought convicts to Port Jackson and were now on their way to Canton to load tea there. To do so, they chose a route from Australia across the Osean to the north, which took them right into the middle of the atoll shoals now named after them. They gradually visited the northern part of the Gildert groups and the majority of the reef rings from the Ratack chain. Counting from SE to SW: Milli=Atoll, christened "Mullgrave" by Gilbert and Marshall, Majuro or "Arrowsmith". Arnho or "Pedder and Danicl", Aur or "Ibbetson", Maloclab or "Calvert", Erikub or "Chatham", Wotje, Likieb and Jemo. Including the names indicated by *) Contrary to the earlier usage, I have retained the English designation of the sound value "sch" by "sh" only in the name of Captain Marshall, but have used our German "ich" throughout for the islands themselves, especially since this spelling has recently been seen in many places.
S. Wallis explored the atolls of Rongerick and Rongelab, so after the voyages of Gilbert and Marshall, the main part of the larger northern row of the archipelago was discovered just over 100 years ago. It is true that the maps that Gilbert and Marshall drew up for their foundlings are still uncertain and inadequate; the longitudes differ by as much as two degrees, and the journals often provide only the barest of clues. But the history of geography has gratefully attached the names of both captains to those Micronesian reefs forever. A few years later, we often hear of ships that sailed through the Marshal Atolls. Thus from 1792-1804 not only were all the discoveries of Gilbert and Marshall seen again, but new discoveries were also made which indicated the existence of a second, more southerly line in addition to the Ratack line. The Russian expedition led by Otto von Kotzebue, a son of the poet August von Kotzebue, around the world on the "Rurik" from 1815 to 1818 was the most likely to have seen the archipelago from a scientific point of view. We value his descriptions of the nature and inhabitants of the Marshall Archipelago as exquisite pearls of German literature. His eloquent words quickly made the quiet isles known, and sensitive minds henceforth raved about the island people, who had happily preserved the archetype of our race. Unfortunately, the news that came out about the marshal groups over the next thirty years was not in keeping with the earlier praise. Their dealings with the unspeakably rough crews of merchant ships and whaling vessels had thoroughly disgraced the once so peaceful islanders. Undeserved mistreatment had become the cause of bloody acts of revenge. From now on, every white man was considered an enemy by the tormented; raids, looting and fights became more and more frequent, so that the archipelago was soon feared as the home of the most treacherous and deceitful barbarians. An improvement in these unfortunate conditions began with the establishment of permanent factories, the heads of which knew how to put themselves on friendly terms with the natives. The work of the mission contributed even more to the settlement of the overgrown people. The messengers of faith Gulick and Pierson gave detailed accounts of their activities on the Marshal Atolls and of the life and customs of their fosterlings in English journals, which were further exploited in Germany by the immortalized geographer of the Pacific, Professor Dr. Meinicke, in his monograph on the Gilbert and Marshal Rifts. Meinicke's fundamental work, which draws on virtually all the sources published up to that time, came to light in 1863 in the 15th volume of the Berlin "Zeitschrift für allgemeine Erdkunde" and should not be ignored by anyone who wants to write about the same subject today. The progress of knowledge over the next twelve years is shown in the relevant chapter of Meinicke's two-volume work on the "Islands of the South Seas". Since that time, the cartographic and literary material concerning our atolls has accumulated noticeably, especially since 1879, when the "Treaties and Agreements of the German Empire with the Samoa Islands and other independent island groups of the South Seas" were published. These documents are accompanied by a map drawn by L. Friedrichsen in Hamburg based on Kubary's surveys, which was, however, superseded two years later by the German Admiralty Map No. 771). The latter is mainly based on the observations and photographs of Captain Jakob Witt and in some cases presents a different picture of those lagoon islands than the British Admiralty charts otherwise used and the special charts of the American ship "Narragansett". I only began to study the German map in more detail in May 1882, just around the time of Darwin's death, whose theory of coral structures is still valid today despite various criticisms. What could be more obvious than to draw a comparison between the latest paintings of the Marshall Atolls according to Captain Witt's mapping and the older descriptions given by Darwin! This comparison led to some not uninteresting results, which I soon turned into a short essay published in the journal "Natur"." Above all, I must not forget to mention the men here, 1) The scale of the general map is 1: 4,500,000, while the 17 plans are drawn at 1: 600,000; in addition, the volumes 1879, 1881, 1882 and 1887 of the "Annalen der Hydrographie rc." contain further cartographic material, often of very detailed design. I have also followed A. K. No. 7 with regard to the spelling of the native names, especially in the use of the terms "Ralick" and "Ratack", which are often interchanged in the older literature. Cf. H. Seidel, Remarkable Atolls of the Marshal Group. Nature, 1832. no. 35 pp. 420-22.

 who in recent times have considerably furthered our knowledge of the Marshall Islands. The name of the Pole Kubary has already been mentioned; however, it need not be added that Kubary spent several months on the islets of the Edon=Riss in 1870 as a traveler for the Godeffroy Museum and described this in detail for the first time since Kotzebue's visits. Dr. E. Graeffe-Hamburg published his correspondence in the "Journale des Museums Godeffroy" in 1873. More than half a decade later (1880), the German consul Franz Hernsheim's "Beitrag zur Sprache der Marschall=Inseln" (Contribution to the language of the Marshall Islands), which is valuable in every respect, was published in Jaluit; this work, which is particularly distinguished by its rich addition of illustrations, was followed not long afterwards by a second, larger book by Hernsheim, the widely read "Südsee=Erinnerungen" (South Sea Memories) from the years 1875--80. In addition, almost all volumes of the "Annalen der Hydrographie und maritimen Meteorologie" edited by our Admiralty contain valuable information on the geophysical, ethnographic and social conditions on the Marshall Islands. The author of the new, rather extensive compilation on the archipelago, Mr. Hager, thus found enough material to be able to develop a broader description. The imperial commissioner for the Marshall Islands recently returned from his voyage to the Wotje or Otdia Atoll in the Ratack chain with a highly interesting report. This atoll, which was given the name of Count Romanzoff by its discoverer Otto von Kotzebue, is all the more important to us because Chamisso stayed here for several weeks. The imperial commissary The imperial commissioner learned that there were still people living on the island who remembered the presence of "Rurik". He was naturally keen to trace these people, and was delighted to be presented with one such witness in the form of a very old but still sprightly man called Taboruo. When questioned by the interpreter, Taboruo explained something like this: "I am the only person still alive in Wotje who saw the first ship of the white men. I remember it very clearly, because I was no longer a child, but a young boy when it came, and it stayed in the lagoon for a long time. All I can say about the appearance of the ship is that it seemed very big to us ... I still remember the names of some of the white men. The chief was called Tottebo, and there were also people called Bödon, Bötto, Tedjmaro, Tamito and Taboka on board. They were all very good and gave us no tobacco, but axes, knives and other useful things. Tottebo also landed four-footed animals here, some of which went "wau=wau" and others "mä=mä", but they were later taken away to Maloclab Island by the great chief Boliet, who ruled all the Ratack Islands at the time. I don't know what the white men wanted here, nor do I remember any of them collecting plants. I, as well as some other older people present here, remember another similar ship, which was here some time after the first, but long before the more frequent visit of the ships from Jaluit, and whose chief's name was Dekaben - (perhaps spoiled from the English the captain?). Kotzebue, Chamisso and Tschischmareff are easily recognizable among the above-mentioned names, and Kotzebue already tells us that the names in question are pronounced "Tottabu", "Tamiso" and "Timaro" by the natives of Otdia Island. The fact that this memory has survived for so many years is probably explained by the custom of the Ratack= islanders, reported by Chamisso, of exchanging names as a sign of friendship. The account of the landing of dogs and goats and their removal by the chief Boliet or, as Chamisso writes: Labeuliet, likewise corresponds to the truth. The ship that appeared later will probably have been the frigate "Predpriatie", on which Mr. von Kotzebue, who had meanwhile been promoted to captain, visited the Otdia=Jasel again on his second voyage around the world in April 1824, where he was greeted lively under his name "Tottabu" and asked about the condition of his friends "Timaro" and "Tamiso".*) Above this friendly memory, however, it should not be forgotten that the Marshall Islanders, even in the near past, showed themselves to be rapacious pirates against the whites. Even as long as our German compatriots have been resident in the archipelago, there has been no lack of occasional repetitions of earlier misdeeds. The people of Rongerick are under the not unfounded suspicion of having committed piracy in 1869 1) Verlag von Fr. Thiel in Leipzig (8°. and 49 pages with 25 figure plates G.

to have attacked the Hamburg schooner "Franz" and killed its crew. In front of one of the passages on the Jaluit or Bonham Islands in 1881, the wreckage of an English ship that was captured here was still visible. Even the unfortunate stray sailors from the island of Gnap, who were taken to Jaluit years ago by a westerly storm, fell prey to murderers, and "some of the victors are still alive today to tell of the catastrophe". With the declaration of German patronage, however, such acts of piracy will probably come to an end forever. The large trading houses visibly expanded their influence on the islands by acquiring land and establishing stations. Shipping traffic is increasing from year to year, and at the same time the number of white settlers is growing at a faster rate. Our warships are almost constantly present in the archipelago, always observing, measuring and charting in order to open up the coral-rich sea with its wonderful atolls more reliably for trade and science. The colonial budget of the Netherlands. (Conclusion.) An article in the previous issue dealt with the considerable revenue that the Dutch colonial administration derives from the sale of products; of lesser importance are the revenues relating to the navy and army. This item represents pure remuneration for services and supplies provided by the colonies to the Imperial Navy or the Imperial Army. The amount remains fairly constant; in the last 5 years, as this time, around 2 million guilders were charged. We can now leave this item and turn our attention to the third and final revenue item, income from taxes, rents and the like. The revenues summarized under this heading, amounting to 84,568,680 guilders for 1890, are all collected in India, with the exception of some interest and instalment payments for railroads, which are made in the mother country. They provide an orienting insight into the nature of the Dutch colonial administration and, more than anything else, give an idea of the value of those rich island territories. It must be borne in mind that the Dutch actually only administer about one fifth of the extensive possessions properly, while the other fifth is only held as dead property by individual officials and small crews in order to prevent a competing power from taking possession. The latter also applies to many large and rich island groups located between Java and New Guinea and known as the "Moluccan Archipelago". These islands are likely to be visited more by German traders in the future, as it can be expected that German New Guinea's relations with Java will become more lively over time to the benefit of both parts. The following examples provide a clear picture of the breakdown of revenues from taxes, rents and the like. Among the main groups of taxes, as they are listed for the year 1890, the capitation tax on nationals amounts to 4474,000 guilders. This tax was introduced in many cases where the provision of unpaid services was restricted. Europeans and foreigners assimilated to them pay personal tax; this amount is 833,000 guilders for 1890. Stamp duties amounted to 1,445,000 guilders and patent duties to 780,000 guilders. These latter two amounts, to which the fees for sales of 615,000 guilders must be added, show that trade and commerce in the colonial territory itself have already developed very briskly. The revenue from the land tax (landrente) is very considerable, reaching the considerable sum of 17,062,000 guilders, to which a further 1,138,000 guilders are added from similar levies on land which the government has transferred to the owners in ownership, leasehold or hereditary tenancy. In some districts on the island of Celebes the government has retained the traditional tithe levy from the harvest, which for 1890 yielded the sum of 232,000 guilders, while a similar levy from South and East Borneo yielded 179,000 guilders. The commercial taxes are mostly obtained by leasing the business. The butcher's rights are leased for 1462,000 guilders; the notorious Chinese gambling houses with pho= and topho games bring in 1043,000 guilders; the pawnshops, also owned by the Chinese, bring in 1,174,000 guilders. The retail trade in spirits, insofar as it is leased out, yields 536,000 guilders, that in tobacco 231,600 guilders Furthermore, the following are leased out: forestry operations, leases and discounts

Page 227

The small craft business for residents is charged with 318,700 guilders; the fishing rights with 321,000 guilders; the bird nesting cliffs, in which the edible "swallows' nests" are obtained, with 246,000 guilders; furthermore the use of the locks with 171,010 guilders The small craft business for residents is charged with 2,940,000 guilders. The income from transportation for railroads and tramways amounts to 53,12,000 guilders; for letter post 86,000,000 guilders and for telegraphy 537,000 guilders. School fees amounted to 337,600 guilders. In addition to the above-mentioned charges, there is a whole series of smaller levies which we can pass over; however, we must discuss the monopoly of two important articles, opium and salt, in more detail. The opium monopoly. The trade in this dangerous stimulant, the sad consequences of which were the subject of a very expert treatise in No. 12 of this newspaper by the late Dr. E. Metzger, is usually transferred to Chinese merchants for the extent of a residency in return for a usually very high rent, who have to buy the opium from the government at certain prices. The monopoly leaseholder has his sales outlets in the prescribed places in the Residentie, where the opium is sold in the retail trade and to which probationary rooms are usually connected. Here, vice is indulged in abundantly at its source and we can refer to Metzger's essay quoted above with regard to the moral and physical disruption it causes in the population. We only want to take a closer look at the leasing system and the financial results The Indian government has experimented with opium leasing many times in the legislation of the last 25 years. In the years 1863-65, it endeavored to reduce opium consumption; maximums were set above which tenants could not receive opium. This restriction naturally led to an increase in the import of smuggled goods due to the difficulty of properly monitoring the long coastal routes. In 1870, the old so-called siram system was reintroduced. Under this system, the tenants had to purchase a certain quantity of opium, the katti (1¼ Amsterdam pounds) at 125 guilders for Levantine and 115 guilders for Bengali products. This stretching was called "tiban". They received the remaining requirements at the trade price and to a limited extent under the designation "siram". This system was also changed again in 1873. From this time onwards, all opium was sold at a fixed price of 30 guilders for the katti, with the government gaining around 10 to 15 guilders from the katti, depending on the market prices in the Levant and Bengal. The maxima that the government delivers to the lessee are now based on actual demand. In the sixties and seventies, the annual income from the lease and from the profit on the sale price of opium amounted to an annual average of about 8 million guilders; it then increased and has amounted to more than 15 million since 1884. Over the last 30 years, the government's income from opium rents can be estimated at over 300 million guilders or 500 million marks. In the possessions outside Java, the income has long amounted to about 10 to 15 percent of the amount of the rent on Java; in recent times, the opium monopoly has also spread more and more outside Java. Although it is claimed that where the monopoly replaces free importation, consumption must decrease, this is not actually true. Nor is this the reason why the government makes use of the monopoly where it is in any position to supervise the business; the financial aspect is the sole motive. If this were not the case, it would not need to use the monopoly for the purpose of restricting free imports, but could in many areas make use of more real, albeit somewhat more costly, means for purely human reasons. The extent to which the foreign possessions prove to be financially useful to the monopoly is shown by the fact that the former ratio of 1:10 to Java has now almost turned into 1:2. While Java pays 9,700,000 gul*) in rent, a slimy soup is prepared from the swallows' nests, which are found in rocky crevices that are difficult to access. The swallows' nests are traded by the picol; a pilol - 125 pounds - fetches the handsome price of around 4000 guilders. About 60 nests go for one pound.
227 the amount raised in 1890 is 4,606,000 guilders. For the year 1890, the total income from the lease and from the profit on prices is estimated at 17,566,000 guilders, compared with 20,411,000 in the previous year. The decline, which will probably soon be offset by new leases in the outlying estates, can be explained by the fact that individual tenants were unable to afford the lease rates imposed on them. In some places these rates are so high that the tenant of a catti of opium has to pay over 200 guilders, a price that leaves no margin for honest retail trade. As a result of the high monopoly price, smuggling is naturally in full bloom. The quantities of smuggled goods intercepted each year amount to more than 8000 catti; but more than three times as much is readily brought under cover by the smugglers, so that for about 5 million guilders smuggled goods are sold to the unfortunate population in excess of the legal quantities. This shameful business cannot be condemned harshly enough; like the Christian liquor trade in Africa, it is much worse and more ghastly than heathen slavery, which in many places takes very mild forms that resemble a tolerable service relationship, while opium and liquor destroy the natives morally and physically. A change in these conditions is made more difficult in the Netherlands Indies, as the colonial economy is essentially based on the use of Chinese coolies, who transfer the vice, which the Chinese cannot do without, to the natives. Examples in German New Guinea have shown us how much the Chinese need opium, where Chinese coolies who were recruited in the Dutch East Indies died because they had to do without opium. So as long as the many thousands of Chinese') are used as merchants, craftsmen and workers, they will also have to be allowed opium. Restricting the vice through stricter measures and regulations, however, presupposes that the government would want to forego 20 million guilders of annual revenue and use this income for better supervision, so that the more or less limited prohibition of opium would be complied with. For the time being, however, there is no talk of such a restriction; as already mentioned, new leasing districts outside Java may even be demarcated in the current year and the lucrative business expanded as a result. The salt monopoly. The salt monopoly, formerly a right of the domestic princes, is now operated by the colonial government as its legal successor. This involves the extraction and distribution of sea salt. On the island of Madura, to the east of Java, there are particularly advantageous beach districts where a very popular, beautiful sea salt has been extracted by ebb and flow without much human help since time immemorial. The salt, which is collected by government representatives, is characterized by its purity and good taste. In addition to the districts on Madura, which are all managed by the government, there are also some good stretches in the north of Java, in the Samarang Residentie, which are also used by the government, but whose yield, because it is less significant, is leased to individual beach villages for around 7,000 guilders a year. The quantities of salt that are extracted annually on Madura vary according to the weather; dry years are particularly favorable for salt extraction. Annual production fluctuates between 1 and 1½ million picols. In 1888, there were 169 sales outlets on Java and Madura for the distribution of salt. In the outlying possessions, the monopoly is introduced wherever salt has to be bought from outside and the administrative bodies are sufficient to carry out such transactions. This applies to the islands of Sumatra, Banka and Borneo, where there are a total of 40 sales outlets. The monopoly works in such a way that the salt is sold by measure at the official sales outlets, usually to middlemen who pass it on to the consumers. In this business, it is not uncommon for the middleman to be cheated by the packhouse manager, the manager of the point of sale, and for the consumer to be cheated with regularity by the middleman. As a result of this often shameless fraud, the authorities are currently considering *) At the end of 1887, the number of Chinese on Java amounted to 232,683, in the outlying possessions 183,817, i.e. 416,500 in the Archipelago, while at the same time there were only 5,2536 Europeans in the Jntian Archipelago. These figures do not include the navy and army.

 to the consumer in certain packaging, which would, however, protect the consumer more against fraud. The government will continue to reserve the extraction of salt for itself and will hardly transfer it to the beach districts, as the monopoly provides good financial returns despite the great shortcomings in administration, which the government itself deplores. For the year 1890, the revenue is estimated at 7,600,000 guilders, of which around 20 percent is accounted for by the above-mentioned external estates. This concludes the discussion of income and we will now turn to the budget as a whole. We saw earlier that the estimate for 1890 closed with a deficit of 12,375,389 guilders. This sum will be too high, as the calculation of the revenue can be regarded as too low, especially in view of the unfavorable sales prices of the products in the previous year, on which the budget was based. If, however, the final accounts should confirm the deficit in full, it will be covered in advance by the substantial surpluses of 1887. Since the protracted Atjeh War has continued to devour large sums of money, it has occasionally happened that in years of poor harvests or particularly bad selling prices for products, the mother country has not drawn a considerable surplus, which in the Netherlands is known as "bating alot", from the East Indian colonies, but has ended up with a deficit. With the increasing expansion of the administration over further areas of the archipelago, income and expenditure grew steadily. In 1850, for example, expenditure amounted to 714 million guilders, in 1860 97 million, in 1870 105 million and in 1880 146 million. In the same years, income amounted to 87.9, 126.5, - 123.4 and 146.8 million guilders. Up to the year 1877 no year was without a surplus worth mentioning; in the years 1851-60 it amounted to 267 million or an annual average of 26.7, 1861-70 22 22.4. 1871-80 108 In the eighties there were mostly deficits, whereby the years from 1888 onwards are likely to be more favorable than assumed in the final conclusion due to the somewhat slow-working colonial accounting chamber.*) For this period, the following figures apply with regard to the annual financial statements surplus: Deficit: 1881 guilders 13,430,305 guilders 1882 19,407,796 1883 6,701,723 1884 1307,373 1885 2,100,295 1886 1929284 25099,819 1887 1888 7,249,698 1889 8,798,663 1890 12,375,389 29,138,398 guilders 69,270,947 guilders. For the period of this decade, therefore, there was a deficit of 40,132,549 guilders. If we subtract this amount from the calculated three decades, we arrive at a total surplus of 559 million guilders for the last 40 years, or an annual average of around 14 million guilders. The mother country drew these sums in cash from the colonies and used them for its own benefit. However, as we have already seen, the indirect benefits to Dutch trade and industry from colonial ownership are infinitely greater. Even the atjehkrieg, which the colony has to pay to the mother country, benefits the domestic commercial circles from which the war materials are supplied, the Dutch *) The two West Indian colonies of Surinam and Curaçao, which have only a minor effect on the budget, are not taken into account *) Until 1877, the surpluses are calculated plus the so-called contributions made by the colony to the costs of the imperial administration. For the year 1889, as a result of the improved sales prices of the treasury, instead of the deficit of approx. 9 million guilders according to the estimate, the final statement of accounts will probably show a surplus.
People as the rightful rulers of the Netherlands Indies. The right to rule is limited by treaties with the native princes, but outside this limitation the Dutch people have full supremacy as rulers. The power resulting from this relationship is applied to Indian finances. This principle has been contested by the Liberals, especially in the last twenty years, and it has been considered right and just that the surpluses from India should also be used for the colony; but it will still take some time before such changes are implemented, as the interest groups in India itself are not yet powerful enough to achieve greater independence for the colony vis-à-vis the mother country. Also, as long as the administration is run by the mother country with all its rights and duties, no objections can reasonably be raised against the existing situation, which is entirely justified historically and politically. Another question, however, is whether the Dutch people have made a noble use of their power, in accordance with the demands of equity and morality. In German terms, the opium question, the regulation of master rights and the slavery question, the restriction of forced cultivation and, finally, the question of culture in religious terms may have been neglected too much in the face of the sinancial plus-mongering. It is also rightly argued against the Dutch colonial economy that it favors the Chinese, who are a real scourge for the natives, too much for the same reason, instead of bringing the natives themselves to a higher level of efficiency and education through well-organized institutions, the Dutch, on the other hand, as capable colonizers who understood how to derive great benefit from the colonies for the mother country and who knew how to preserve the right to independence as a people through their colonial possessions in the era of the Great States. Dr. H. Bokemeyer. The Wanjamnest. By Paul Reichard. After the conclusion of the Anglo-German treaty, according to which the borders of our colony in East Africa are, for the time being at least, fixed, our first and foremost task must be to examine the country for its sources of aid in order to exploit them as far as possible. First of all, we are interested in the inhabitants of East Africa, as we are and will remain dependent on them. The author cannot accept the idea of sending Chinese to Africa as workers. We have sufficient manpower in the Africans, which can be put to good use if this task is tackled in the right way. However, this will not be discussed here, but a people will be described whose importance for East Africa has already been repeatedly pointed out by the author, and more recently also by Wißmann, namely the Wanjamuesi, a tribe which deserves our greatest interest. Tribes, language. The Wanjamuesi (sing. Mjamuesi), among whom the author lived for two years and whom he had around him for five years as a traveling companion, form a large tribe in East Africa, which extends east of Tanganyika over an area of land approximately the size of Bavaria. The Tanganyika forms the western border. To the east it extends to the western border of Uhähä (the spelling Uhehe is incorrect) and Ugogo. To the north it extends as far as the Wawinga and Wassukuma tribes. The latter are also generally counted among the Wanjamuest, but wrongly, they belong to them only linguistically. In terms of their ancestry, physique, facial structure and expression, skin color, character and state constitution, they are undoubtedly to be assigned to the Wagago and Usagara peoples. To the south, the Wanjamuesi are joined by the Wasipa. The Wakimbu in the Mgunda=mkali, bordering the Watatura to the north, belong to the Wanjamuesi. Further north, the Wassukuma and Wawinga are joined by the Wajui and Wasumboa. The latter had been almost completely displaced by Mirambo since his appearance and migrated for the most part to the Luapula and Katanga. Along the Tanganyika the Wawende. The Wakonongo are located north of the Wasipa and west of the Wahähä. From there to the north, also west of the Wahähä up to the Wakimbu, the Wanguru. Enclosed by the above mentioned Wanjamnesi tribes are the Wanjanjembe, Wagunda and Wagalla. These are

Page 229

the main tribes of the Wanjamuesi. There are also a number of smaller tribes, but they are of no significance and belong to this or that sub-tribe. The Wanjamnest often call themselves all together and always with a certain pride Wagallagansa. A tribe bearing this name no longer exists, but it seems that one once stood at the head of a great empire that has long since fallen into ruins. The Watusi who immigrated to Mjanjambe come from Urundi in the north of Tanganyika and belong to the strange Wahuma people, who are of Abyssinian origin. The Watuta or Wangoni are immigrant Zulu. In Mdaburu on the western border of Ugogo there are Wikimbu; this place no longer belongs to Ugogo. The Wakimbu in Mdaburu have customs. Since 1880, with the gradual reoccupation of the Maundamkali by Wonjamnesi, they have remembered their old ancestry and transformed themselves back into Wanjamnesi. It is a common phenomenon in Africa for weaker or subjugated tribes to adopt the customs, traditions and language of more powerful tribes. The language of the Wanjamuesi, Kiunmjamnesi or more correctly Kinjamuesi, is a Bantu language related to Kiswahili, i.e. a prefix language. However, it is much poorer in concepts and words than the actual Kisnaheli and is characterized by the lack of forms for the third person, as the same terms are used for the second and third person. The place names and conjugations in Kinjamuest are very precise and the language is difficult to learn even for the coastal people. As with all Bantu languages, everything that is not descriptive, e.g. political topics, must be discussed three or four times because of their lack of terminology, in order to achieve an exact understanding that excludes all doubt. This is also the reason for the infinitely long and complicated negotiations and discussions of the same topic and always arouses great astonishment in speeches for those who do not understand the language because of the eloquence. In fluent language, with great pathos and lively gestures, a Mjamuesi can speak for hours about which a European would be able to make himself completely understood in 4-5 sentences. Shape. The Wanjamuesi are genuine Bantuneg people and the pure typical Mjamnesi can still be distinguished very clearly despite the multiple mixing with other tribes through imported slaves. The figure is slender, rather tall than short with its bone structure and fine joints. The position of the pelvis, which is so characteristic of Reger, is not as noticeable in the Wanjamuesi. It is not tilted forward as much as in other Reger tribes, so that the upper body protrudes very little or almost not at all in front of the thighs and the buttocks, at least in the male, are hardly more protruding than in us. In women, however, the buttocks are more prominent. Very peculiar is the frequent occurrence of unequally long or too short arms in the Wanjamuesi tribes, more so than in other tribes. The occurrence of cripples is very rare. They are not killed, but pitied, as it is assumed that they have been disfigured by sorcerers. The face is narrow, as are the nose and lips. The musculature is not strongly developed, but very dry, giving the impression of toughness and endurance. Muscle strength, on the other hand, is poorly developed. The rager is not at all capable of suddenly concentrating his strength at a given moment; hence it may be that even a relatively weaker European can easily overpower a very muscular Negro. The European is generally far stronger than the Negro. However, when it comes to continuous feats of strength, such as carrying loads and working in the fields, the Mjamuesi is unsurpassable in performance and endurance and it often seems incomprehensible how such a slight figure, which apparently consists only of bones and skin with a few underlying muscle pads, is able to carry such heavy loads continuously, usually in the great heat of the sun, or to work the field by hand for the whole day for 12 hours with only a little rest. It is this characteristic that makes the Mjamnesi so valuable for our cultural endeavors in East Africa. Incidentally, one can only explain the extraordinary endurance in the above-mentioned activities, which does not seem to be at all in proportion to his strength and appearance, by the fact that, in addition to muscular toughness, a kind of absent-mindedness makes the performance possible. If, however, this peculiar quality of being absent-minded during work is taken away from the Reger, he is unfit for work, at least for that which is constantly demanded of him without compulsion. Lively people from the coast, who are already more mentally alert, are much less able to carry out work such as load-carrying and field work with perseverance. Children. There is almost no mother among the Wanjamuesi females who does not suckle her child herself, often for three years, so that sometimes the older child still suckles with the youngest and the mother has had milk continuously in the meantime. Despite their sensuality, Wanjamuesi and other Negro women often abstain from all contact with men for a whole year or longer, and this may also be a reason for their polygamy. One characteristic distinguishes the Reger children from our children: they hardly ever cry. The upbringing of the children is the least of the Mjamuesi's worries. The father does not worry about it at all and the mother only as far as nature requires, i.e. until the child can walk and no longer needs the breast. In their youth, children enjoy an enviable freedom in that they can do as they please, completely left to their own devices. The children, like all Negro children, are therefore characterized by an astonishing precociousness and ridiculous blashness compared to our children. As soon as they are beyond the earliest age of childhood, they have nothing left of their charming, beautiful childishness. They know everything that adults know and, as we understand it, have no naivety at all. Reger, on the other hand, remains childish until the very end of his life. One might think that with the complete lack of education and supervision on the part of the parents, the children must become very naughty. But this is by no means the case. The author has never noticed any actions on their part that seemed particularly worthy of punishment. The freedom they enjoy to such an extent seems to have a calming effect on their minds. They don't even know how to stretch, which is so popular with us. They are almost mentally mature at the age of seven and eight. It is this early maturity that causes such great difficulties in the civilization of the Regers, a moment to which no attention has yet been paid. It has become hereditary because the Reger has grown up in the same way for many millennia. It will take many generations for the Reger's brain to remain as formative for as long during his youth as it does in our case. The Reger children never play like our children, they are not able to immerse themselves in play in such a way that the rest of the world does not exist for them for hours on end. They have no stimulation and too much time. It is only in the evening when the moon is shining that the children's desire for pleasure awakens along with that of the adults. They either take part in the dances of the adults or dance alone, whereby the children are characterized by the greatest frivolity, which is often outrageous for Europeans. However, children will never retire earlier than adults. Young people of both sexes are already being encouraged to work, but always without compulsion and as far as their strength allows. Boys and girls cultivate the fields with their parents, and the girls help their mothers to prepare food. Girls begin sexual intercourse at the age of eight and nine, boys at twelve and thirteen. This early onset of a profoundly influential expression of life is the main cause of the early age of both sexes. Clothing and jewelry. The true Mjamuesi gives the impression of a "savage" as far as his outward appearance is concerned, i.e. his clothing. The man's clothing consists of two small skins of wild cats or antelopes and goat skins, which hang over a thin strap of skin or bast to cover the bare back and front. When sitting down on the ground, the front hide is pushed between the legs under the buttocks, while the other is spread out behind. Only the chief (mtommi) and the nobleman (mgane) have the privilege of wearing lion and panther skins. However, obtaining skins requires almost too much work for the lazy Mjamuesi. He therefore prefers by far to wear tree bastos (sani pl. masaui), which are made from the bark of various forest trees and Ficus indicus by beating after removing the bark. The fabrics produced in this way have a beautiful reddish-brown natural color or they are dyed dark gray in black slate clay mud. They are worn as hip cloths and serve as blankets during the night. In men, the hip cloth extends from the belt to the knee, in women a little further down. The upper body remains naked from the hips upwards for both sexes. On very primitive handlooms, the Wanjamuesi understand

Page 230

very good at weaving a coarse shawl-like cotton fabric called mseketo. The female toilet also includes a very peculiar bodice, which is worn throughout Africa. It consists of a simple cord which is passed under the arms, slightly above the original position of the nipple, and wrapped tightly around the body. At first sight, one always misjudges the purpose of this primitive corset, believing it to have the purpose of pressing the breasts down, while on the contrary it serves to lift them. (Conclusion follows.) The return of Dr. Peters. Dr. Peters and Lieutenant v. Tiedemann arrived happily in Berlin on Monday, August 25, and were warmly welcomed by friends of the colonial cause. Dr. Peters had already been welcomed in Milan by Mr. O. Borchert, a member of the expedition known to our readers, on behalf of the Emin Pasha Committee. Dr. Peters also received the warmest of welcomes on the road, especially in Wildbad and Nuremberg. He received the following telegram from the Legation Councillor Kaiser, who is currently in Tölz: "On behalf of the Colonial Department of the Foreign Office, I greet you after your first rest on patriotic soil with the wish that your rich experience will benefit the East African Society and the entire German possessions in East Africa. I would be extremely pleased to see you soon." This is a remarkable sign that the attitude of the Reich Government towards Dr. Peters has become more friendly. The chairman and other members of the Emin Pasha Committee as well as a delegation from the Berlin branch of the German Colonial Society had traveled to Jüterbegk to meet the arrivals. - In the afternoon, the meeting of the Emin Pasha Committee took place in the rooms of the Imperial Court to receive the oral report on the progress of the expedition. Minister of State v. Hofmann, next to whom the gentlemen of the expedition had taken their seats, opened the meeting with a speech in which he briefly reviewed the history of the Emin Pasha Committee since the departure of Dr. Peters and expressed the thanks of the committee to Mr. Peters and his companions for the energetic execution of the undertaking. Dr. Peters then gave a broad outline of the expedition's march up the Tana bin, past Kenya, to Lake Baringo, and on to Uganda, developing many new points of view, and dwelling especially on those areas which are only briefly mentioned in the reports. It was no small feat to unroll a magnificent picture of the expedition's march in an uninterrupted speech for almost two hours after an exciting journey. Peterl has become somewhat thinner as a result of the exertions he endured, but otherwise looks quite well, while Lieutenant v. Tiedemann, who suffered from dysentery for some time during the expedition, still seems to be suffering somewhat from the after-effects of the African climate. The following resolution was then adopted unanimously: "The German Emin Pasha Committee expresses its warmest thanks to Dr. Peters for his faithful devotion, untiring perseverance, bold courage and great prudence in leading the German Emin Pasha Expedition; the Committee acknowledges that Dr. Peters has fulfilled the task entrusted to him as leader of the expedition, as much as was incumbent upon him, and has fully justified the trust placed in him. The festive dinner in the large, beautifully decorated hall of the Imperial Court was held in the most animated atmosphere. Next to the chairman of the Emn Pasha Committee, Minister of State v. Hofmann, sat Dr. Peters on the right and Lieutenant v. Tiedemann on the left. Among the party participants, the following should also be mentioned: Professor Schweinfurth. Oökar Borchert, Captain Leuinant Rust, President v. Tiedemann, v. d. Heydt. Count Arnim-Muskau. Privy Legation Councillor Rettich. Paul Reichard. Ditektoren Vohsen and Bourjan, Vice-Admiral a. D. Livonius, Drygalkki Pascha and a number of gentlemen who had previously been in the service of the African Society or the Schutztruppe. The departments of the German Colonial Society were also represented in large numbers. Minister of State v. Hofmann took the floor first to recall the motives behind the German Emin Pasha enterprise, which had been motivated by love of country and a genuine love of humanity. For he had sought to bring help to our compatriot, who had suppressed the slave hunts in the heart of Africa and bravely stood his ground against the advancing Marxism. The real purpose of the expedition had been to enable Emin Pasha to take up his post, which was extremely important for the work of civilization in Afrila. The expedition had achieved what human power was capable of in this direction, for Dr. Peters had reached a point under enormous difficulties from which it was only a few days' journey to Emin Pasha's most distant outpost, so that the purpose would have been achieved if Emin Pasha had still been in his position. But only a few days' journey from Wadelai, Peters Kenninis received news of Emin's forcible removal by Stanley, and the expedition was thwarted as a result. But the expedition was nevertheless not without benefit; it opened up a previously little or almost unknown area and showed what German courage and Denian perseverance can achieve, even in a private enterprise that was carried out without official support. From the very beginning, the Emperor, as he could certainly assure us, had been sympathetic to the Emin Pasha enterprise and the bold men who had undertaken it, and he certainly shares our joy at the happy return of those long thought lost. We look up to our Imperial Lord with the greatest trepidation, and with full confidence we see the protection of the Ebre and the interests of Germany in his hands. The Imperial Patron was saluted and the assembly enthusiastically joined in. Prof. Dr. Schweinfurth, as the "oldest Africa traveller", then rose to give the actual speech to the members of the expedition who were present as guests of honor. In these rooms, where many a happy returnee had already been given a festive welcome, the occasion aroused reflections of a very special kind. We have seen many go out and some return, but none under suspicion like our Karl Peters, the often-deceased, already lamented, the overly defeated and yet always victorious, the much-disputed, always admired, he who, through willpower, perseverance and confidence, so often knew how to make the working luck submissive to him, to the defiance of all natural forces and to the scorn of the malicious stumbling block of human work. Like a phoenix risen from the nightmare, he triits into our midst, with unburnt feathers, fresh and unweakened. So we greet him in every sense as redivivus. But in order to rejoice in him even more and to be uplifted by his image, we must first celebrate in him the noble, selfless Pairiote, whose example will continue to shine as long as the history of the great empires finds a place in the memory of mankind; Pelers led the way in the long-distance competition with England for East Africa, he caused our material influence in Zanzibar itself to outweigh that of the English for some time, and thus unconsciously created the value of the exchange for Heligoland. Redner then describes the dangers of the African voyages, the scorching sunburn in the waterless steppe, the bush forest with its thorns, the swamps, the downpours, the plague of insects, the battles with warlike natives, the whole register of hardships and discomforts that Virgil already describes with the words: Durum itor - -- serpens, sitis, ardor, avenae, Duleia virtuti: gandet patientia duris, Tantus amor patriae! Karl Peters happily endured all this, as it was done for the greater glory of the fatherland and the efforts had to somehow benefit the fatherland. Incidentally, Dr. Peters also regarded the expedition as a useful side wing of the Reich's campaign in East Africa. On his way back from Uganda, he actually made the name Wadutschi (German) unrecognizable within our new borders. He did not achieve the actual purpose of his journey, but by his march, among other things, he proved the complete falsity of Stanley's travel plan by putting it to the test. If Africa had still been what it should never have ceased to be, the free territory for the competition of European morality, the ground on which only those who come first to seize it can acquire the title of king, then things would be different today. But the tiresome politics, this necessary evil, the terrible goddess of modern times stretches out her bony arms to Africa, spoils the future of the peoples there, black as well as white, paralyzes the spirit of enterprise, and finally falls as pernicious flour on the tender violets of our modest dreams of the future! The speaker then went on to say a few words about the enrichments that geography will owe to the St. Peter's expedition. Since many important reports by the traveler were lost en route, the full extent of his discoveries could only be guessed at, and it was only today at the committee meeting that we heard the first revelations from our guest of honor himself. The entire course of the Tana River, the eastern and southern slopes of the Keni will be correctly entered on the map for the first time, as will a stretch at the end of his journey between Lake Victoria and Ugogo. There will be enough completely new information to make the journey appear as a gain for science in and of itself. In conjunction with Höhnel's photographs of Kenya, Peters' achievements take on increased value. Over a distance of more than a thousand kilometers, his route forms the weft thread that holds together the weave of the Jtinerar lines up to this point, and not only connects the side threads that Thompson and Count Telecki drew from south to north with their paths, but also for the first time brings about their reciprocal deflection to the Indian Ocean and to the already explored regions in the north of Lake Victoria. We can expect the most important contributions to our knowledge of the peoples from this side. Dr. Peters and his courageous companions deserve our praise. After the roaring cheers with which this high was received by the assembly had subsided, Dr. Peters took the floor for a short, emphatic reply. "Gentlemen! We were surprised that our expedition found so many participants in Germany, as I have learned here. Above all, I have to thank the Emin Pasha Committee, my committee, as I said in Africa. We actually did nothing more than try to do our duty. If we had to make abnormal efforts, it was because we found abnormal difficulties. I know very well that a large part of the resistance that the German Emin Pasha expedition encountered was due to me personally, and from the very beginning I felt it was my duty to do everything in my power to overcome the difficulties that the company encountered for my own sake. I am imbued with gratitude towards the men who entrusted me with the command of the company 1 year ago, even though they knew full well,

Page 231

that numerous individual enmities would have ceased to exist if they had entrusted the leadership to someone else. We only sought to do our duty, using our strength, and did not spare our lives. But what gave us the moral courage and the determination not to flinch in the face of difficulties and dangers was the awareness that we were the bearers of a national idea in Africa. We never forgot this responsibility, it weighed more heavily on us than the responsibility for our own lives and those of the 70 people involved in our expedition. I have already commented on the political results of our expedition. We only had to carry out our mission We have nothing to do with the way things turn out from the perspective of the central decision. We were not even in a position to judge what was politically necessary. The decisive thought for me has always been that Germany should have a position abroad commensurate with its great importance among the nations. After 1870, the task was to go beyond the borders, but the colonial idea falls under the national one, it is only a part of it, of which we have always been aware, here as on the terrible Edene Leikipia. It was our pride to know that in this we were one with the best of our people, who came together in such great numbers in the German Emin Pasha Committee. This awareness gave us the strength to persevere and defy all dangers and obstacles." The speaker now vividly expressed his gratitude, especially to the chairman of the Emin Pasha Committee. His Excellency, Minister of State von Hofmann, had never wavered in his devotion and loyalty to the national idea. What could have happened from this side had been granted to them, but the highest thanks were due to Providence, for he had often felt in some situations that nothing but God's protection could lead them through. And God's protection was faithfully at their side, as was the goodwill of their friends. The German Emin Pasha Committee, embodied in its chairman, deserved his high praise Mr. v. Tiedemann first expressed his fatherly joy that his only son had returned home happily, and then continued: "Let us remember two men today whose names are inextricably linked with the historical development of East Africa. When the first decision was made to send the Emin Pasha expedition, all those who had a warm heart for the great national undertaking were filled with lively joy that a man who had provided incomparable samples of bold energy and unshakeable prudence as an African traveler had been won over for the expedition with his rich gifts and experience. The names Peters and Wißmann were on everyone's lips. Fate had other plans. His Majesty the Emperor entrusted Wißmann with the task of restoring peace in the outstanding territories of East Africa as Reichskommissar. I need not tell you how Wißmann accomplished this task. Gifted with a rare talent for organization, he was able to form and discipline a protection force in a wonderfully short time, whose military successes have aroused universal admiration. An expert on African conditions, he knew not only how to restore German prestige in the right place and by the right means, but also how to strengthen it to an eminent degree. Today we can say that the African uprising was a stroke of luck for Germany. Without this uprising and without its defeat, the black, white and red flag would not fly as proudly in Africa as it does today, where it is held in universal reverence. Respect has been shown for Germany, respect for German blows, and that is the most important requirement towards uncultured tribes. The shameful trade of the Arabs, the slave trade, has already received a fatal blow. Wissmann's prudence and energy will succeed in adding further peaceful successes to the military ones and in fertilizing our colonies with the blessing of German morality and intelligence. He will succeed in this all the more because he now has a helper at his side who, like no other, is made to pave new paths for culture in Africa. This brings me to the second German we must not forget today, the man who gave our expedition its name. When Gordon fell in Chartum, when it looked as if the Mahdi's reign of terror was about to overrun the whole of Central Africa, general interest was focused on the wonderful man with the German heart and the Arabic name who, as the Egyptian governor of the Aquatorial Province, manfully defended the last bastion of culture. At the time, he was a kind of mythical figure to the general public, surrounded by a glimmer of adventurous romanticism. Now he has come closer to us in human terms. We know him from his letters, we know him from the descriptions of German countrymen, but we have also received a telling picture of him through Stanley. No one will want to claim that Stanley's reports reveal any particular benevolence for Emin. And yet it is precisely these sketches, coming from an opponent and interwoven with all kinds of spitefulness, that shed light on Emin's peculiar personality in their reluctant astonishment. I see him before me, the serious, quiet man who makes his decisions slowly, but sticks to them with tenacious tenacity, I see him before me, how he holds endless shauris with astonishing patience, but can never be made to wear down and always gets his way in the end, how he creates order and change in the confused circumstances of his Aegpptian province, how he teaches his people to weave cotton fabrics, to make clothes and drapery, to manufacture powder. Building houses and roads, caring for each individual in a fatherly way, keeping the smallest as well as the largest equally in mind, a soldier, a statesman, an administrator and, in addition, a German scholar! That such a man has been won over to the German cause is not the least of Wißmann's merits. Let us be proud to be able to call him one of our own, a man who, barely recovered from a serious accident and inspired by a sense of patriotic duty, immediately set off for the West again, this time under the German flag. Let us wish Wißmann a speedy and complete recovery and a return to the scene of his victories, let us wish Emin a resounding success in his first German expedition, let us wish both of them that they may gloriously complete the work of civilizing East Africa that they have so happily begun, hand in hand. Former Vice Admiral Livonius commemorated Prince Hohenlohe-Langenburg, the colonial politician from the bottom of his heart, a driving force in our colonial policy, who had always taken the keenest interest in the Emin Pasha enterprise, while Dr. Peters paid tribute to the old master of African exploration. Professor Schweinfurth, toasted. After staff physician Dr. Falkenstein, the member of the German Loango expedition, had brought his glass to Lieutenant von Tiedemann, who had been trained by Peters, Mr. von der Heydt read out the numerous telegrams received from private individuals and departments of the German Colonial Society, from which we would just like to highlight the following: "Vienna. Greetings and handshake on his feast to the courageous and glorious victor over African misery and over petty European party spirit. A guest of Muanga." (Dr. Junker. D. R.)*) After Prof. Schweinfurth had thanked Dr. Peters, Assessor Jacodi (Stettin) drank a toast to the German=national idea, which had been so brilliantly realized in Peters' research trip. A member of the Association of German Students saluted Dr. Peters as the enemy of all philistinism, especially in major national issues. This concluded the celebration. Announcements from the Society. Section Blankenburg a. H. On Wednesday, August 27, our department had the great pleasure and honor of seeing Major von Wißmann in its midst. At the instigation of Mr. Pahndirektor Schneider, he had visited the Harz=Cogwheel Railway Blankenburg=Tanne and arrived at the festively decorated station at 1 o'clock, greeted with cheers by the numerous crowd and warmly welcomed by members of our local department. At the banquet held in his honour, which was attended by about 80 people, ladies and gentlemen, including Dr. Bumiller, the mother and sisters of the guest of honour, the Reichskommissar emphasized that it was not time to rest on our laurels, that the tasks of the Colonial Society were still great and manifold, and called for numerous members to join the Society. In a second speech, he paid moving tribute to his Schutztruppe and their loyalty to the death. The Major, who made an extraordinarily fresh impression and won everyone's hearts by storm with his amiable nature, now seems to have completely overcome the consequences of his illness. We will all never forget the hours we spent together in the Bromberg department. Lieutenant von Tiedemann has arrived in Bydgoszcz, where he was given a festive reception by the detachment. Small messages. - (The Reichskommissar v. Wißmann) is known to have praised the Catholic missions in East Africa over the Protestant ones in an omission that became known weeks ago. In particular, he had praised their more successful method of treating the natives, acknowledged their educational power, which sought to influence the Negroes not only through religious exercises, but especially through regular employment, and he had put the Protestant missions, which caused more harm than good through their political interference, far in the shade. This judgment had drawn him open rebuttals from the Protestant prospective missionaries, which he seeks to refute in the book now published. Mr. Warneck had argued against the Reichskommissar that the Catholic missionaries in East Africa were "French", while the Protestant missionaries were wrongly accused of political interference. Mr. v. Wißmann, for his part, provides evidence for his assertions in a brochure. His accusation against the Protestant missions is not directed against the German, but against the English branches, with regard to which he cites a number of facts in his new pamphlet that their political agitation is beyond doubt. He proves that it is precisely the influence of the Scottish mission on the Nyassa and the "undertakings of the African Sea Company", which are entirely dependent on it, that is responsible for England's expansion there, and that the recently deceased Mr. Mackay, under whom the English Uganda mission had long been under, was to be induced to conclude treaties with chiefs on the shores of Lake Nyanza as well, in order to dissuade Germany from this lake wherever possible. Wißmann also reports that the English missionary Horn was almost killed in Udjiji because he had flown the English flag. The university mission in East Africa had changed its attitude towards Germany since it knew that East Africa was German. Of the Catholic-French mission, von Wißmann says that the missionaries are not French, but German, and from now on may only be German by higher order. Contrary to Merensky's assertion that the Catholic mission uses "violence" in the acquisition of Negro children for education and is engaged in "slaveholding", *) In this context, we would also like to mention that Count Telecki and Höhnel from Saromberke also sent telegraphic expressions of admiration to Dr. Peters and Lieutenant v. Tiedemann, who had returned from Africa, about the success of their magnificent journey.

Page 232

 Mr. v. Wißmann rejects this accusation as "unjust" and recounts how he himself had witnessed a missionary child who had been reclaimed by a Negro from the Jnner as his relative and had been handed over to him without refusal. "To equate the buying up of slave children by the missions with the activities of the slave traders is invalid, because in such a case the mission does nothing else with its means than what the warships or troops supervising the slave trade do in their own way when they hand over the freed slaves to the mission institutions." "I know," he writes further, "that the Protestant mission has many years of experience; but you will agree with me that the unified leadership and great discipline of the Roman Church are more conducive to making better use of its naturally much older experience than is possible in the Protestant mission, which lacks general leadership, in which the individual missionary is given far greater freedom, and in which far too many detachments with weak connections make overall leadership difficult." The accusation that the Protestant missions work more expensively than the Catholic ones, Wißmann also refers only to the English missions and remarks: "While in English missions one lives almost exclusively on canned food, which is expensive and not conducive to health, the Catholic missions feed themselves and their pupils well and cheaply. When on my first journey from the West I found huge amounts of canned food at English missions, food that was not very tasty and healthy for the time, I was surprised to find bread, butter, milk, European vegetables and fruit at the Catholic mission in Tabora, all of which came from the fields, gardens and herds of the mission. In Roman missions, the pupils are also responsible for building houses, establishing communication with each other, transporting goods and even, in an emergency, defending the mission against predatory attacks, whereas English missions have to employ workers, porters and soldiers for high wages and often with great difficulty. . .. I confess, without thinking that I can forgive myself as a Protestant, that the rite of the Catholic Church makes a greater impression on the Bantuneger than the inferior one." Finally, he returns to his assertion that, at least in Central Africa, the labora must precede the ora among the Bantuneg people. It is only through work that the Negro is prepared to accept Christianity; by nature he is too superficial and indifferent for Christianity to make an impression on him. V. Wißmann made himself available to his opponents for discussion in Verlin from September 15 to 30 about the details, especially about the missionary methods. The letter contains the wording of the statements by D. Warneck, Zahn and Merensky as an appendix. - (Dr. Peters) had meetings with the representative of the Board of the Colonial Department, Wirkl. Legationsrat Rettich, and with the State Secretary of the Foreign Office, Freiherr v. Marschall, in the first few days after his arrival and was then also received by the Reich Chancellor. Sunday evening. August 31, Peters was ordered to visit His Majesty the Emperor in Potsdam and had the honor of giving a lecture to Their Majesties the Emperor and Empress. On September 1, Peters went to Munich and Tölz, where he will consult with the head of the Colonial Department of the Foreign Office, Privy Legation Councillor Kapser, at the latter's request. His Majesty has awarded Mr. Peters the Order of the Crown III Class. (On the assassination of Bishop Hannington) Dr. Peters makes some contributions in an article published in the Deutsches Wochenblatt, which is dated March 13 from Bubagba-Uganda. As is well known, Bishop Hannington was murdered on the orders of King Muanga while attempting to enter the country from the east, north of the Victoria Njansa. When Hannington arrived at the border of Usoga on his westward march, the Usoga Sultan, who had subjugated Uganda, told him that he must forbid him to continue his march until he had reported his case to the Ho at Mengo and received a decision from there. This continued until he encountered stronger forces and a Waganda troop that happened to be present in the territory of Sultan Luba, in western Usoga, from whom he was arrested and, when the court of Mengo pronounced the death sentence, was murdered with all but two of his men. The Sultan Luba had fled on the approach of his expedition and Peters remarks that it would certainly have given him particular satisfaction to punish Hannington's executioner accordingly. In November of that year, Hannington's bones were carried to Kavirondo, and on February 18, 1890, Peters and his expedition were the first white men to cross the Nile from the east into Uganda. In agreement with Ashe in his Tuo kings of Uganda, Peters gave as the reason for Hannington's murder that there was an ancient prophecy in Uganda that an expedition would come from the east through Usoga, which would put an end to the Wakintu dynasty and "eat" Uganda. Accordingly, the road from the east to this country was closed to everyone. In his book, Ashe reproduces the rest of the bishop's diaries, which date back to October 29, a few days before his assassination. - (The well-known Father Schynse writes about the Mywapwa station in a letter dated June 14: "Caravan traffic has been restored. We encounter large masses of ivory and thousands of porters heading for the coast to bring loads from there to the interior. Here in Mywapwa, the fort and house are being built and a well is being dug in the middle of the fort, which is already 7½ meters deep through hard rock. With the wind always blowing here, a small wind motor is well placed to transport the water into the well, so that the gentle slope of the fort, which is perfect for irrigation, could be transformed into a beautiful garden. Meanwhile, the need for fresh vegetables has already been taken into account; there are quite a number of European vegetables, including potatoes, in the garden of the station in the valley. Once the well has solved the water problem - the water in the stream causes dysentery - Mywapwa will be a tolerable, if not pleasant, place to stay. (Dr. Schmidt's) expedition against the Masiti has, according to new reports, been very bloodless; no enemy has been seen and much of the enemy's approach has probably been empty rumour. Dr. Schmidt marched with the expeditionary corps as far as the Rusiji, from where he returned alone, while the corps marched on to Kilwa under the command of Chief Ramsay. No news had arrived from there in Zanzibar by August 3. (Cameroon.) The African traveler Dr. E. Zintgraff is in Berlin, and Lieutenant v. Spangenberg, who is assigned to his expedition, has arrived here with him. He is also taking a Mr. Huwe with him from Hamburg, who is to take over the direct leadership of the Karawaue on the journey to the Adamana region. In trading circles, many hopes are pinned on the Zintgraffian expedition to the Adamana region; there are certain indications that not only will it be possible to cultivate profitable crops in those regions that have not been touched by Europeans up to now, but that trade will also be profitable. German Southwest Africa). The Reichs=Gesetzblatt contains the imperial decree of August 10, 1890, issued on Heligoland, detailing the legal situation in the Southwest African territory. - The Colonial Gazette of 15 August brought the conclusion of a series of articles on "Namaqualand, its inhabitants and economic conditions" by Mr. Hermann, who is also well known to our readers and who has now left for South West Africa again. In it, the possibility of extensive cattle breeding and, albeit limited, agriculture is calmly demonstrated, so that enterprising people can only be advised to read these remarks. - Dr. Goering was in Okahandja at the beginning of the year, where Maharero organized a large celebration. The mood among the Hereros is the most favorable imaginable. They have completely reconciled themselves to the presence of the troops in the country and will also agree to the settlement of part of them in Windhoek. - (The first list of scientific shipments received from the German protectorates is published as a supplement to No. 16 of the German Colonial Gazette. The collections are mostly ethnographic and zoological in content; valuable botanical specimens were only received from Cameroon. Of the plants sent alive, 139 species have so far been preserved in culture. The number of herbarium plants etc. amounts to 146. Botanical research in our colonies, especially on the practical side, is still very poor and one can only repeat the complaint already made by Prof. Schweinfurth in the Deutsche Kol.=Ztg. (1885, page 476): "Among the envoys who have been used for the research undertaking in equatorial Africa so far, I see mineralogists, ethnologists and other specialized researchers, but not the only authoritative plant experts who, after some preparation, as permitted by the current state of our flora knowledge of Africa (and for which purpose the aids offered in Germany are sufficient despite all their shortcomings), would be able to orient themselves in a bewildering abundance of very easily exploitable riches, which alone would be able to draw attention to what is primarily relevant to the commercial exploitation of virgin territories. The Congo State and Vortugal). According to the "Indépedance", the Portuguese envoy in Brussels had sent a note to the Congo State government protesting against the creation of an East Kuango district, i.e. at the same time against the incorporation of the territories of Lunda and Muata Pampo into the Free State territory.

The steamer on the Biktoria-Nyanza. At the general meeting of the German Colonial Society in Cologne, Major Liebert expressed the wish of Major von Wißmann that the City of Cologne or the Colonial Society or the major industrialists of the Rhineland and Westphalia should provide funds in some form or other for the construction of a steamer on the Victoria Nyanza. The appeal has not gone unheeded; in Cologne, money has been collected in secret for this purpose, and Wißmann has taken the opportunity to personally emphasize the importance of building such a steamer in Blankenburg as well as in Bremen and Hamburg, with such success that the greater part of the costs for the steamer, estimated at 150-200,000 marks, has probably already been raised and, as we have heard, the steamer has already been ordered from a Hamburg shipbuilding company. However, Major v. Wißmann's plans are not limited to strengthening Germany's influence in the area of the Victoria Ryanza by creating an armed steamer. Wißmann also wants to have steamers built for Lake Tanganyika and on the Nyassasce, some of which have fallen within the German sphere of influence. It is very gratifying that the ideas of the Reichskommissar have found such support among the citizens of the Hanseatic cities and that collections have also been initiated in the rest of Germany to promote the plans for East Africa's exploration. The foundation collected in honor of Dr. Peters will probably also be used for such a purpose, since, as the managing committee of the Karl Peters Foundation has confirmed, Dr. Peters has declared that the procurement of a steamer for Lake Victoria would be in line with his wishes. Fortunately, there is no lack of active participation in this colonial cause in Germany; it is not just a matter of words, but also of action. The depression of spirits caused by the announcement of the Anglo-German agreement is apparently disappearing and people are once again looking to the future with optimism. From Major v. Wißmann's speech in Bremen, we would like to highlight only one point, which referred to the steamer for the Victoria Nyanza. According to the Weser newspaper, he said: "Now, gentlemen, I ask you to take a look at the map with me. Our German East Africa has not only one coast - and you know that for us the coast is the most important point of our possessions - but it has two coasts, an eastern and a western one, the latter being formed by the shores of the three lakes, Lake Victoria=Ryanza, Lake Tanganvika and Lake Nyassa, a coast which separates us from immense territories, some of which are under the control of the Congo State, some of which are under the control of England. Gentlemen! After clearing and securing the sea coast, the next most important point is to secure the western coast, because it also mediates traffic with the countries further inland, as well as the slave trade, which is brought into our territory from the interior. The most important of these lakes bordering us is the northern Great Victoria-Nvania, which, as you have noticed, also covers the richest countries of our territory. - You may all have read that England is making efforts to bring a steamboat to this lake in order to be ahead of us in dominating the shores of this lake and in gaining influence on it. Gentlemen, I, who have been familiar with the situation for 11 years, and at any rate have a correct judgment of the conditions there, am firmly convinced that we must make efforts to get ahead of them, or, if this should not be possible, which I do not at all believe, at least to assume an equal position. It will then undoubtedly be redressed, much will be put back on track which, as many people believe, has been damaged by our last treaties. It is my dearest wish to have a steamboat on Lake Victoria for the work that lies ahead of us, possibly ahead of the English steamboat that will be brought up there. And I would like to assure you that it is not a leap in the dark on our part if we undertake to get a steamboat there, as it is quite possible, contrary to what the newspapers have been saying in recent weeks. The emphasis on trade interests was sure to find a sympathetic ear in Bremen, which is proud of its Hanseatic past. But if today in the Hanseatic cities not everything is as it should be with regard to interest in German colonial affairs, the apparently growing realization of the value of our German colonies for exploitation by trade will certainly soon bring about a change. Until now, the anti-colonial press had been able to find some support for its views in the fact that a large number of Hanseatic citizens cared little about German national colonial policy, but continued to follow their old and well-known paths in all countries. But if she goes on to argue that the Hanseatic peoples established on the west coast of Africa or in the South Seas regard the German protectorate as something quite secondary, she is committing a major error, if not a deliberate falsification. One need only recall the difficulties encountered by the Hanseatic League on the Society Islands, which had become French, how the struggle for dominance in trade finally turned out in favor of the national flag, and how the English exploited the annexation of Fiji in a quite unheard-of manner in order to damage German commercial interests under the pretext of protecting the natives. The example of Samoa is also very instructive, for hardly anyone would dare to deny that an annexation of Samoa by the Germans in 1880 would have given our commercial interests there a tremendous impetus which would have made us the undisputed rulers of the archipelago. The trading companies, which were gradually expanding their business to the western part of the Pacific, clearly saw the time approaching when they would have to withdraw from the eastern part due to competition from the English and French, who were covered by the flag, and the far-sighted merchants went on accordingly. But if such conditions could develop as a result of national rivalries even before the beginning of German colonial policy in the South Seas, then the merchant in West Africa, whether he was a German or belonged to another nation, was at the mercy or disfavor of their whims in the coastal countries where native chiefs ruled. What was the Hanseatic merchant in Cameroon before the German Empire seized it? He did not play an enviable role vis-à-vis the often insolent chiefs; there was no question of direct trade with the hinterland, he only held his own through a clever system of swings,

which was truly nothing less than uplifting, but the security he gained certainly imposed great burdens on him Advantages are already so clear today and will become even more so It is downright ridiculous for the colonial enemies to still want to draw the conclusion that the German colonial movement is superfluous from the assertion, which in itself is quite correct, that the German colonial policy there has been digested on the factories of the Hausaten in West Africa. If the German Empire had not spent hundreds of thousands on exploring the hinterland, had not set up a government and chastised the unruly chiefs, the Hamburg merchants would still be sitting on their hulko in the Cameroon River and none of them would dare to go a few miles up the Mungo on trading business for well-founded fear of being murdered. If the Hanseatics hente follow the trains of the explorers into the interior and break through the ring of middlemen, this again confirms the truth of the so often attacked saying that trade follows the flag. Originally applied to trade by sea, the phrase also has a profound meaning for the African mainland. One can compare the caravans with a ship, the almost impenetrable primeval forests and waterless deserts with unknown and dangerous seas, the tribes of the interior with islanders, and will then soon realize that the flag of the caravan has a meaning of its own. It was not the desire to expand political power, not the urge to reach unknown faraway lands that shone golden in the imagination that led to colonial policy, but the realization that Germany could no longer stand idly by in the competition of other nations to expand their territories and make colonization independent of external influences. It is understandable, even natural, that some Hanseatics today continue to work quietly in the old ways that helped to establish their wealth and pride, but the anti-colonial side should finally stop trying to persuade the younger generation, who want to seek out new fields and other opportunities, that all endeavors for our colonies go beyond solid commercial daring and end up in adventurous project-making. However, we do not wish to place the sole emphasis on the advantages to trade that would result from the existence of a steamer on the Victoria-Nyanza, as the size of the trade that would prefer the direct route and could bear the costs of steamer transportation cannot be approximated. For a first condition for a great development of trade in the interior is a good connection with the coast; as long as this is not established, but transport is dependent on all kinds of contingencies, the emphasis will have to be sought on the other side - on the general civilization side. More than a million people live on the shores of the lake, who come into contact with Europeans more and more every year and whom we still have to win over to culture. The field for our activities is so large, the barbarities of the peoples living there so appalling, that it seems like a saving civilizing act to be able to plant new seeds of culture everywhere on the coasts with the help of a steamer and to keep restless tribes in check. For these last political reasons, we consider it important that not sailing ships, as proposed by various parties, but steamers be built, which are independent of wind and weather and superior to slave ships in size and speed. Wißmann; they call it a leap in the dark, although the English already have steamships on the Nyassa and Tanganyika and although the Congo State and the missions have brought several steamships across the difficult terrain between Matadi and Stanley Pool to the upper Congo. The German steamer would have to be larger than those previously mentioned and the difficulties of transportation would increase accordingly. In a lengthy conversation with Major v. Wißmann, however, the writer of this report has become convinced that under present conditions the dangers of transportation are not insurmountable, and that the technology of dismantling steamships has reached such a high degree that it is possible to move the individual parts even on African paths. We can confidently leave this matter to Major v. Wißmann and his staff of trained and experienced people. For us, it is now a matter of gaining the moral, political and commercial preponderance on the Great Lakes; may colomal-friendly Germany prove itself equal to this task!
Cameroon. The research trips to Cameroon have made such progress in recent years that it is appropriate to take a look at what has been achieved so far on the basis of the map and then discuss the agri-cultural, social and political conditions for the development of the colony. When the Germans arrived in the country, only a narrow coastal strip was known, some explorers had climbed the Kamerunberg and had penetrated the rivers to the first falls, but the jealousy of the tribes engaged in intermediate trade proved to be an insurmountable barrier. The Zanzibarites, with whose help Stanlcy had crossed Africa, and who still supplied by far the best porters and soldiers, were not to be found here, and the cowardly coastal population, despite the scorn with which they treated the Bushnegs, were extremely wary of the stronger tribes of the interior. Apart from these obstacles, however, penetration into the country presented many natural difficulties. The courses of the rivers are only navigable for short distances, there is dense, almost impenetrable jungle on the banks, the Kamerungebirgsstock is difficult to bypass and in the south a belt of jungle stretches as far as the Rio Campo, which is almost 25 German miles wide and only sparsely populated in a few clearings. Therefore, when the Foreign Office made some funds available for the exploration of the hinterland in 1886, two research areas presented themselves, one to the north and one to the south. The first was given to him by the need to get in touch with Benus, from where Flegel had already tried to penetrate into Cameroon. Dr. Schwarz's attempt to reach the hinterland from Cameroon had been unsuccessful and, as was evident from his reports, extensive and lengthy preparatory work was required before this research work could be undertaken again. Dr. Zintgraff (born on 16 January 1858 in Düsseldorf), who had already travelled the lower Congo with Dr. Chavanne in 1884, was chosen to lead the expedition in the northern region. He set up the barombi station at Elephant Lake, where both scientific and cultural experiments were to be carried out. The station consists of a house for the Europeans with a store room above and a workshop for the carpenter, a house for 80 workers, an interpreter's house for 8 men, a kitchen, a poultry house and a meteorological observatory. The residential building is 9.5 meters long, 6 meters wide and stands on 2 meter high piles, the room height from the floor to the roof ridge is 6.3 meters. From this station, which soon became the base for several scientific travelers, Zintgraff tried to make an advance to the north in May 1888, but had to turn back without success; a new attempt in July led him to the land of the Bauyang, but these tribes were hostile, so that Zintgraff had no choice but to return to the station and gather strength for a new expedition. As early as January 1889, however, he returned to the Banyang, this time accompanied by a strong caravan of particularly capable West African Negroes who were bound to command the respect of the village chiefs. Zintgraff still had to fight his way, but then reached the grasslands of Sudan. The Bali, in whose territory he now found himself, did not yet belong to the actual Adamaua tribes, but are to be described as border tribes similar to them in customs and outward appearance. Although Dr. Zintgraff had made blood friends with Fo Bessori, the Oder chief of Na Taku, who tirelessly consumed palm wine, the chief Garega was able to delay the expedition for several months, which Zintgraff used to set up a station. At the end of April, Zintgraff was able to set off and reached Bafut via Bandeng, a village of 4000 inhabitants, whose chief Kualem controlled the road to Bagnic. The inhabitants, who were trying to extort large sums of money, seemed to be treacherous, so that the traveler had to find his own way, which led the caravan through inhospitable terrain until they reached settlements with strangely constructed houses (round with round pointed roofs). According to the Haussa interpreter's explanation, these were plant villages, like those in Adamaua, which belong to the larger villages. The natives were already wearing the long house robes, pants and turbans, were armed with long swords and spears, but, although otherwise friendly, did not allow the expedition into their mud-walled villages. Empty bottles of schnapps, which like the tops of towers

Page 235

The roofs of the houses revealed that white people were not far away. From Takum, Dr. Zintgraff reached Donga on the Wukari River, a vine river of the Benus, on May 28th, and had thus made the connection to Flegel's travels in the most fertile part of Adamaua. Then he went to Okagri (Flegel's Wukari), where the traveler was kindly sent provisions by Mr. McIntosh, the agent of the European Niger Company on the Benus. In Ibi, too, he was hospitably received in the company's factories there and was able to equip himself with the necessary supplies.
235 olonialjeitung. a factory of the Royal Niger Company had already been established. There he met one of Flegel's former companions who had been with him in Berlin, Madugu Gaschimbakt, whom he took into his service. Gaschka was the first village he entered in the part of southern Adamaua that belonged to the German sphere of interest. As the local chief Sambo declared that he would not allow the expedition to go to Bagnio without the permission of the chief of Jola am Benus, the traveler went to Jola himself, where he was well received. However, the chief could not give him a guide to Bagnio as he himself was not well known, so Zintgraff went to Gaschka to the hospitable and intelligent Sambo.

Page 236

returned. The same man gave him guides who took him to Takum, which he had left five months ago. On the way to Bafut, the expedition was hit by a bad storm, as a result of which 16 people died. After an absence of six months, Zintgraff arrived back at Garega on the Bali station, and after everyone had recovered, in Barombi and on January 5, 1890 in Cameroon. This remarkable expedition, the consequences of which cannot yet be overlooked, reminds us of the efforts that Robert Flegel, the courageous German pioneer on the Benus, also pursued in these countries, insofar as it relates to Adamana. We have before us a series of yellowed sheets written in pencil from his estate, which contain the last information about these regions as collected by R. Flegel. The document is not fully complete, the conclusion is missing, and neither the place nor the Dakum is indicated, as Flegel was probably suffering from a fever at the time of writing. We believe that we would not be wrong if, in the same sense as his brother E. Flegel, we regarded this as the traveler's last major colonial-political communication. Robert Flegel's last report. "A state may exclude any other state from intercourse with a third country in case of insult or offense, if the latter is not willing or willing to do so. Guernasbonalec Bileren. At a time when the eyes of all peoples are so prominently fixed on the giant rivers of Africa flowing into the Atlantic Ocean and on the territories of western Sudan, through which they flow and which until recently were almost entirely unknown, this principle of international law will also have to be applied in particular to states with semi-civilization and even to territories of savage peoples. It cannot be denied that such practical application will have its particular difficulties, but the existential needs of most of the peoples of civilized Europe have increased so much in recent times that it is a duty of self-preservation for many, and especially for us Germans, not to allow ourselves to be excluded from the competition for the great material and non-material advantages offered by lively intercourse with such peoples. Dr. Hübbe-Schleiden has described these advantages so convincingly that hardly anyone can match him in this respect, least of all surpass him. Suffice it to refer all doubters to his figures, and for those who are not convinced by them, their view is an incurable stagnation in socio-political terms. England has long enjoyed the advantages of this traffic almost exclusively and owes its wealth, prestige and position of power to this circumstance. It is understandably anxious to preserve these for the future and endeavors to cover the occurrence of probable losses by securing new territories. Hence the recognition of Portugal's rights to the Congo, against which the competing world rightly and successfully vetoed under the leadership of Prince Bismarck, hence the intrigue to monopolize the entire Niger-Benus region, where it seems that England should retain the victory. In many respects this parallels the recognition of Portugal's power in the Congo and is just as unjust against the competing civilized world as it is against the rights and the resolutely expressed will of the population and the rulers in the Sokoto=Gandu=Reich The official announcement made to me by Mr James A. Malcolm, dated Bakundu, October 1, 1888, reads: I beg to inform you that the National African Company has concluded treaties with the kings of the following countries: Bubundjidda, Jola, Murilane, Nassarawa, Keffi, also with the kings and chiefs and people of the tributary rivers, Tarabba. Donga, Kitschena (should be called Katrena. Note Flegels.) and with the varions tribe of natives on the river Benuë as far as Lokodja. - This report is untrue with regard to Jola - i.e. the whole of Adamaua, the most important area for us and for the Elsenbein trade -, very questionable with regard to Bubundjidda, at least contestable with regard to the Tarabba area, Kundi, Beli, by our former rights, and is disputed by the rulers with regard to many other areas, so it is in the same case with Kundi. Since I sent my last report to the Society, to which I had to enclose a letter for the Foreign Office, the circumstances have changed proportionately in my favor. I forced King Burba, who had not directly answered my various requests to continue building the house, to reply by writing to him and asking him to summon the legal scholars and his grandees to either tell me why he had revoked the promise made to me earlier or, if I had not brought this treatment upon myself through my own fault, to reconfirm the rights granted to me and not to make them dependent on the decision of the English. The letter was read out publicly and translated to him; he immediately agreed with me completely and ordered me to resume the construction of the station. Once I had made the necessary arrangements to complete the construction in Kundi, I prepared to travel to Jola. The road to Gaschka had been blocked by highwaymen and only recently a large caravan had been completely plundered, the leader Madugu Matsugo and many others killed. Burba promised me an armed escort, but this was not forthcoming for a long time as his subjects showed little obedience; I waited a fortnight in Beli for their arrival and sent messengers to Gaschka. In Beli I almost succeeded in regaining my former rights, and there is no doubt that I will succeed. - This time I was disturbed in this effort by the arrival of Mr. N. Thomas, agent of Kundi's company, who had closed his business and had come to Beli with loads which he was distributing "to his friends". Nine horsemen and thirty men were sent from Gaschka to meet me and I was able to leave without having to wait for Burba's guard, which followed us the next day, ten men strong. In Gaschka I learned that the English had presented the sovereign with a treaty during their visit, which was only for securing the trade routes and for the promise not to allow any Europeans to stay in his country: Not to allow any European to stay in his territory who was not recommended by them, the Company - guaranteed an annual reward of 20 rifles, 20 barrels of powder and a witness. The sovereign Zambo, who is particularly favorable to me, replied: I (Abdurahamani is his friend) had left things with him and had to make an exception. I came across an order issued for rifles and powder and left behind by the gentlemen of the company in Gaschka, which was sent to Kundi for redemption. Nevertheless, I have no doubt that Zambo did not enter into that contract. Zambo received me very kindly and sent messengers to Jola to help in my matter. They were absent for a very long time (35 days instead of 12), one messenger fell ill on the way. In Goncha, where Djammo Bakari, the town governor, had held back my earlier messengers and letters (out of fear of his feudal lord), the messengers from Gashka were now given the letters to take with them. The ruler of Jola presented both (mine and Zambo's envoys) with ceremonial dresses and told me to come, but did not reply to mine with a letter. Zambo had expected a letter and was disappointed, even worried that he had not done the right thing by interceding on my behalf and feared that his liege lord might be angry with him for it. My hands and feet had been lame from a cold since my arrival and I was told to wait until a second messenger had investigated the cause of the Jola's behavior. The Northwest German Trade and Industry Exhibition in Bremen. By Dr. M. Lindemann. The visit of a large number of members of the Colonial Society from a number of German cities on September 6 and 7 has noticeably revived the interest in our colonial affairs, which has been so weak here up to now. This was clearly demonstrated at the reception in the park house of the exhibition on the evening of the 6th, which unfortunately could not be attended by the Reichskommissar Major von Wißmann, as had been hoped. Held back by his visit to King Leopold in Belgium, he only arrived here on the 7th in the morning. Even if the regret that Wißmann could not be present at the commemoration was, of course, a general one among all participants of the latter - some 300, among them men from all circles of our city - the lively interest that has awakened in a large part of our population for the endeavors of the German Colonial Society was evident in the inspiring speeches that were held from various sides, in the undivided applause, as well as in the warm responses that they received. In addition to the speech by Senator Stadtländer=Bremen, who paid tribute in brief, fitting remarks to the merits that the Reichskommissar Major v. Wißmann had earned through his successful participation in German African research and, more recently, through his rapid and thorough suppression of the Arab uprising in German East Africa, the speech by Dr. Schaefer, a native of Bremen and currently Professor of *) 70 gentlemen from 30 German cities had registered from abroad.

History at the University of Tübingen, is remarkable. He professed to be a staunch supporter of German colonial endeavors, justifying them in particular by historical facts. He recalled that soon after the discovery of America, not only the Welsers of Augsburg, as is well known, but also the Hanseatic cities, among them probably also the Bremeners, did not lack the greatest efforts to participate in the direct world trade opened up by the newly discovered sea routes to the East and West Indies, as well as in the colonization of the distant countries opened up, and how only Germany's impotence at sea caused these efforts to fail in the same way as it could have happened. that Queen Elizabeth of England drew a thick line through the well-acquired trading privileges of German merchants and that the Baltic Sea voyage to the Neva was closed to the German flag in violation of the treaty. Thus the German colonial aspirations of the present day are linked to the goals that the Hanse merchants once aspired to, but were unable to achieve due to the lack of a unifying power that could balance the various individual interests and stand strong and feared on the outside. This power has now been created in the Kaiser and the Reich in a vital and effective way, guaranteeing the final fulfillment of the colonial tasks to which Germany is called. Lively applause followed these fitting words. The numerous ovations that were given on September 7 to the Reichskommissar von Wißmann, who had arrived in the meantime, not only by the festival participants but by the entire population in a surprising, truly magnificent manner during his visit to the exhibition and the city, were of course first of all for the bold explorer and brave man who, as the president of the exhibition, Mr. Papendieck, said, had created peace and order in the territories of East Africa acquired by the German Reich and thus opened up new paths for trade. However, an interest, albeit still unconscious, for the cause itself, for the prosperity and economic development of the German colonies, especially in East Africa, also prevailed in all these rallies, even if at present in Bremen this interest with regard to East Africa can only be a general patriotic one, since Bremen's trading and factoring interests in Africa are currently limited almost exclusively to West Africa, to Togoland. The President of the Senate, Mayor Buff, also praised the efforts of the German Colonial Society in his dinner speech with warm words, while Mr. J. F. Wessels proposed a toast to the Emperor. At this banquet in the Parkhaus, Major v. Wißmann very aptly linked his request to the merchants of Bremen to help the German colonial enterprises and in particular to take an active interest in the procurement of a steamer to maintain and strengthen German influence on the Victoria-Ryanza to what he had seen at the trade exhibition. The products of the plantations exhibited there, which had been established by Bremen merchants in tropical countries, proved brilliantly that they understood colonization well, and thus Wißmann rightly does not give up the hope that the knowledge, experience and relationships acquired in this way will soon be used with the help of the considerable financial resources Bremen has at its disposal - this is shown, among other things, by the report published by Wißmann. Wißmann and the gentlemen of the Colonial Society visited the magnificent new free port near the city - will soon be utilized by Bremen's merchants and shipowners for the benefit of trade and shipping to our colonies, as well as for the management of the latter. Senator Stadtländer then toasted the guests of honor present, Director Bruhn (Lübeck) to Dr. Finsch. After the ovation given to Dr. Finsch, Senator Stadtländer took the floor once again. When, a number of years ago, as it was the seventieth birthday of the Prince Imperial Chancellor, he had justified the Society's request to send an address to Prince Bismarck at the Colonial Society in Berlin, he had done so with the short words that were applauded at the time: "Bismarck has added to all his unspeakable services to the Fatherland the fact that he has made our Fatherland the Motherland. No further words are needed to justify this. Everyone would like to unite in cheering Prince Bismarck. "Long live the founder of our unity." After the jubilant applause died away, the following telegram was sent to Prince Bismarck in Varzin with equally enthusiastic approval: "The festive gathering of Bremen citizens and numerous members of the German Colonial Society in honor of the Reichskommissar, Major v. Wißmann, sends its most respectful and grateful greetings to Your Serene Highness." - The speaker then went on to say that no one regretted not being able to attend the meeting more than Prince Hohenlohe=Langenburg, the President of the German Colonial Society. He had written that the doctor had forbidden him to travel because of a recent eye infection. The suggestion to send the following dispatch to Prince Hohenlohe=Langenburg was received with loud applause: "The festive assembly of Bremen citizens and members of the German Colonial Society and Major von Wißmann send their most respectful greetings and sincere wishes to Your Serene Highness. Timotheus Fabri from Cologne to Dr. Carl Peters, Mayor Menge (Lauenburg) to the festive committee and Mr. Engels (Ruhrort) asked the local branch of the Colonial Society to take the matter in hand and to promote it quickly. The interest of the gentlemen from the Colonial Society in the exhibition naturally focused on the trade exhibition, through which a guided tour lasting several hours was undertaken. Following on from what we said in No. 16 of the Deutsche Kolonialzeitung, we would now like to make a number of remarks about this exhibition, in particular highlighting a number of articles that are imported by sea, raw or semi-processed, and are further processed by German industry into profitable products. We will first discuss ivory or stone nut, which is presented to us in the Colombia section in an extremely instructive manner as a raw material, semi-processed or processed product. The fruits of the tagua tree (Phytelephas macrocarpa) are known to contain pigeon or chicken egg-sized seeds which, when fully ripened, have the properties of ivory and are processed mainly into buttons under the name ivory nuts, stone or corozo nuts, vegetable ivory. This industry began in Germany only 25-30 years ago and has since developed significantly in various towns, especially in Schmölln; the main port of import is Hamburg. Below I provide somewhat more complete statistics than those offered by the catalog of last year's Hamburg trade exhibition, the importance of the articleo is clear enough from this. The Tagua or Nuez de Corozos is native to the hot, humid, low-lying river valleys of Colombia and Ecuador; the most favorable terrains are those which are constantly flooded in the rainy season and then lie dry for 3-4 months. The following should be noted about the growth of the plant. The plant grows without a common stem or trunk, it sprouts its palm-like leaves from the ground from the same root for years. The fruit forms at the root, just below the surface of the soil, and is recognizable by the swelling of the relevant part of the root. The fruit reaches the size of a melon, its flesh is soft, juicy and does not taste unpleasant, it encloses the taguad (about 6-10). The tagua seekers throw the fruit out of its bed with a spade, the drying up of the fruit or the rotting of the flesh parts is caused by the weather. Many taguas are stirred up by the large herds of wild pigs - peccaris-sahinos - who eat the meat while spurning the seeds (taguas). The latter are then collected and piled up along the watercourses during the dry season. The first rains cause the forest streams to swell and allow them to be navigated by rafts (balsas) and canoes; these vehicles are then used to transport the tagnad to the banks of the larger rivers for transportation to the coast. The tagnad is harvested twice a year, the time depending on the two annual rainy and dry periods. The fruit (the seed) is edible when encased in the pulp and serves as the only food for the tagua seekers for weeks when their rations become scarce. When the plant is separated from the flesh, the tagua hardens quickly. The swampy lowlands where the taguas thrive are understandably very unhealthy and therefore not populated; the fate of the tagua seekers - tagueros - is not at all enviable. Apart from the discomforts of life in the jungle, the tagueros often have to struggle with hard privations on their expeditions, which are equipped twice a year for three months at a time. The poor devils often bring back the life-draining germ of malaria from their expeditions. As far as the quantity and value of the stone nuts imported into Germany is concerned, the previous year's trade exhibition catalog notes that Hamburg had almost completely taken over the trade in stone nuts, with only smaller steamship shipments going to Havre, Lwverpool and London. The following is a statistical overview of the quantities and value of the shipments of stone nuts in Hamburg.

The working of cast stone in the Colombia department, which is shown in a large number of objects united in a large glass cabinet, is extraordinarily instructive; it shows the different working methods used in the various factories. For a number of years, chair cane has become no less important for the German, and especially the Bremen, industry through the manufacture of various types of products from the trunk of the rotang or reed palm and some other East Indian palms. As one of the best experts on the flora and fauna of Sumatra, Dr. Hagen, who lived for a long time in the tadak cultivation districts of eastern Sumatra, tells us in an excellent treatise, rotan is one of the most useful plants, even in its heath. The extraction of the cane, of which the Malays distinguish 12 species, is difficult and laborious. The Rottan palm has no crown of leaves, the branchy trunks are covered lengthwise with climbing leaves, by means of which the long thin trunks entwine other trees and climb up them, at the same time sending out sharp-spiked leaves, which turn the forests thus occupied into thickets that are difficult to penetrate. Rottan is used in many different ways, as the rich sections of Borneo and Sumatra at the trade exhibition show: stakes, ropes, wire, hinges for stores and doors, baskets and chairs, snares for hunting and strings for musical instruments are all made from rottan. The rottan used by the Malays as a binding material is made pliable and supple by soaking it in water for 8-14 days or burying it in swamp. The finest and most sought-after rottan is rottan segah (Calamus beteroideus), about the thickness of a little finger, the strongest is the thumb-thick rottan semambu, from which the walking pieces are made. Although not common, there are sticks 4 feet long that consist of a single limb without knots. The Malays give the sticks a beautiful golden-brown color by oiling and smoking them. The dragon's blood red tan is one of the coarser varieties and also makes very good walking sticks. In the main hall of the exhibition are the products of two important chair cane factories in Bremen: Semi-finished and finished products, tastefully displayed. These two factories, which employ a large number of workers, were built in 1872 and eight years earlier. The cane, which arrives in bundles, partly in the regular steamers, partly as additional cargo in the rice ships from the East Indies, is first cleaned, sulphurized, bleached and sorted in the factory, then processed into the various semi-finished products required by the basket and chair makers and also the cane and whip factories. Bremen imports around 2½ million kilograms of chair cane every year. As is well known, coconut palms provide a further material that is used in an extraordinarily wide variety of ways. Originally native to the East Indies, they are now widespread in the coastal areas of almost all tropical countries, as the exhibition shows, for example, in the South Seas and the West Indies: South Seas and West Indies. The fibrous husk of the coconut is known to provide the material for ropes, sacks, brushes and mats. The hard stone shell is processed into a variety of utensils, while the kernel, cut and dried, is traded as coprah and provides cooking and fuel oil, as well as the material for the manufacture of soaps and candles. Jute is another article which, imported from India, has given rise to large factories for processing by spinning and weaving here in the city of Bremen and in the nearby Oldenburg town of Delmenhorst, following the example of the German interior and Scotland. The catalog of the trade exhibition gives some remarkable explanations about this. The main country of cultivation of jute, the well-known fiber, is, as everyone knows, India, namely Bengal, where the two species of the jute plant have been cultivated since ancient times, not only for the fiber, but also for the leaves, which are used as a vegetable when fresh and as a remedy when dried The cultivation and export have grown in Bengal, according to the demand, on a huge scale. In 1829, exports amounted to only 364 quintals; in 1873, they had risen to 4.2 million quintals and the area under cultivation amounted to 921,000 acres. Ten years later, exports amounted to 10.2 million quintals of raw jute and 60.7 million jute sacks, which corresponds to a value of 120 million marks. Since then there has been a considerable increase, so that exports in 1888/89 were worth 152 million marks. The number of jute mills in Lower Bengal and the Calcutta area was 24 with 149,937 spindles and 7,681 looms, according to an official report available to me. The main exports of manufactured goods from India go to China, Japan and England. The jute factory here in Bremen is very important; it has 1200 horsepower and is equipped for 6000 spindles and 320 looms. The products of this great establishment are displayed in various stages of processing together with imitation jute plants in a beautiful group in the main production hall. In the trading hall, a model of an inteplantation shows us the whole process of jute processing up to its shipment by sea. The latter is carried out in bales of various types, each weighing 180 kg. Among the other Indian products shown in this section of the trade exhibition, shellac deserves special mention. In the models we see the entire treatment of this resin, which is produced by the sting of an insect on the Croton lacciserus tree, which belongs to the Enphorbiaceae family, as well as on some Ficus species. Shellac is produced from this by melting it down. Shellac is the main raw material for sealing wax, but is also used in the production of varnishes, for polishing carpentry work, for mastics, millinery stiffeners, etc. The catalog of last year's Hamburg exhibition stated the annual production of shellac at 75,000 crates. We would only like to refer here to other articles of Bremen's trade exhibited in groups, which, although important, are not of primary importance, such as coffee, grain and wood; finally, we turn to some geographical groups that seem to us to be of particular importance to the colonial economy. There is, for example, a small exhibition of Ceylon and the Malabar Coast, which is due to established Bremen merchants in both areas, partly of ethnographic and partly of colonial economic interest, due to the various products and soil products which form the object of trade. Spain and Poringal form a very attractive and rich group. Besides ores, corkwood plays the leading role among the products exhibited here. The cork oak grows and thrives so far only in the littoral of the Mediterranean; attempts to plant the tree in America have failed, perhaps because the soil was not chosen with due care. In the countries of the Mediterranean, the cork oak grows in the lowlands along the coast and rivers as well as in the mountains. In the lowlands it seems to grow more quickly because the annual rings of the bark are further apart. Corkwood with wide annual rings is generally softer than that with narrow rings. The color of the wood grown in the lowlands tends to be greyish-white, that of the wood from the heights yellowish-reddish. The quality and thickness of the cork bark varies greatly, as does its use, from the smallest medicine stoppers to large champagne corks. Cork bark is relatively best cultivated in Spain and Portugal. Of course, little attention is paid to the care of the tree and the planting of young trees; everything is left to grow as nature produces it. However, the more often and the more carefully a tree is peeled, the better the quality obtained. The first

Page 239

The first peeling of a tree is called virgin wood; because it is too uneven and cracked, it is not suitable for cork production. In more recent times, this so-called virgin wood is ground into a kind of flour and, like the waste from cork factories, is used to make linoleum, the well-known cork carpeting. Apart from Spain and Portugal, large cork forests can be found in Algeria and Morocco. The French went to great lengths to expand the cork forests, but were often disturbed by the Kabyles, who destroyed entire areas by fire. Algeria's yield is roughly sufficient to cover France's consumption. The cork bark of the Algerian tree is of quite good quality; the assortment, on the other hand, is very poor in comparison with Spanish and Portuguese products. The export of cork bark from Morocco is prohibited; if it were to be released now, it would not enrich the corkwood market for the next 10-12 years because the trees are not peeled and the bark is too cracked; only a regularly peeled tree provides usable bark. There are not many cork oaks in Italy and they are only used for consumption in the country. A cork tree is also said to grow in the littoral of the Adriatic Sea, but it is not known in wider circles whether its bark is strong enough to make cork. In Greece and the countries of the Levant, cork oaks are said to have been planted in large numbers in recent years. For the time being, therefore, most cultivated countries, including the United States of North America, are dependent only on Spain and Portugal for their cork wood requirements. It would therefore be very desirable if the cork oak could also be cultivated in other parts of the world. After all, the cultivation of the chinaberry tree finally succeeded in Java, after unsuccessful attempts had been made in various parts of America and Africa. The tree originally grows sporadically, within large forests, in certain parts of South America and the extraction of cinchona bark was very laborious, hence the enormously high price. On Java, the tree is grown in plantations, thrives magnificently and provides the owners with a large income. Of course, the cork tree cannot be compared with the Chinese tree, as the value of cork bark is already relatively low; however, it is of benefit to all cultivated countries if they can fall back on different countries of origin when procuring the necessary raw materials. There has been a significant cork industry in Delmenhorst near Bremen since ancient times, partly still as a cottage industry, and the very important linoleum factory there also processes cork wood and waste from cork production. These factories exhibited their products in the main hall. The extremely rich and instructive Mexico section also contains some other fiber materials, which we will discuss in more detail here because of their industrial uses: Henequen, also known as sisal or aloshape, a yellowish white fiber made from the leaves of several species of alosha and agave. The fiber of henequen is hard and extremely divisible, it is processed into coarse fabrics, packing cloths, carpets, as a wrap for damask-like upholstery fabrics, as well as paper, ropes - such as those made in Cuba - and ropes. These ropes, which are mainly used in mining operations, are said to be less heavy, but stronger and more elastic than hemp rope, and at the same time highly resistant to the effects of water. Mexico's annual export of henequen amounts to 3-4 million dollars. There are numerous samples of henequen at the exhibition. Istle (Mexican fiber) is a fiber that also comes from agave species, which grows partly wild and partly cultivated, especially in western Mexico. The leaves are harvested in their green state, then scraped off, washed, dried in the sun and combed out with wooden combs. The product is then tied into strands, which are exported in bales, especially to the United States. On display are currycombs, sacks, halters, ropes, brushes and mats made from istle. In the Brazil department, the industrial utilization of raw materials from the plant kingdom is less prominent; at best, the vessels made from the fruits of various trees should be mentioned here. Finally, we highlight ramis, a species of Bohemia from the nettle family, as an important wickerwork material. Samples of the silky-soft, shiny fiber of this plant can be seen in the departments of Japan and the West Indies, where it is cultivated. We have heard that a Thuringian spinning mill, which has focused on spinning ramis, has achieved significant results; as repeated experiments have shown, the plant does not thrive in our climate. From the rich exhibition of Jamaica I would like to single out one article for the sake of curiosity; it is annatto, a dye obtained from the pulp of the annatto bush (Bixa orellana, Bixaceae family) and used mainly in the manufacture of artificial butter. The export of annatto from Jamaica amounted to half a million pounds in 1888. The main purpose of the above information was to draw attention, on the basis of the material brought together by the exhibition, to some industrial raw materials which, for reasons unknown to us, have hitherto received less attention from our industry. Many visitors to the trade exhibition have asked what fate awaits them after the exhibition closes in October. To this I can certainly reply that it will remain, even if it will be some time before a definitive organization with buildings, administrative staff, etc. can be created. Postscript. As this article goes to press, we have received the news that the Board of the Bremen Trade Exhibition has decided to keep the exhibition in its present building for another two years. During this time, it is hoped that the Bremen State will construct a separate building for its natural science and ethnographic collections, which were previously inadequately housed, and that this building will then provide a permanent home for the trade exhibition, which in the meantime still needs to be enriched and completed. For the administration and maintenance of this exhibition, which is to remain open to the public for two years, the necessary funds will be raised by the merchants and the current board of directors will remain active. Bremen, September 1890: The Wanjamuesi. By Paul Reichard. (Continued.) In the last fifteen to twenty years, the fabrics imported through trade have become very widespread and have almost completely replaced the indigenous fabrics, while the bark fabrics are still worn, especially in places away from the caravan route. The Mjamuesi do not do without jewelry either and are just as much under the compulsion of fashion as the most refined man of culture, indeed they suffer even more than the latter under its inexorable laws and endure torment for its sake, against which the too tight patent leather shoes of a fashionable fop or the lace-up bodice of vain women may produce pleasant sensations. The author once observed how a girl of about 16 had sambor rings made from buffalo tail hair spun over with his wire. Men and women wear 2-300 of these rings over their ankles. To prevent them from slipping off the foot, they are made so tight that they are difficult to bring over the instep. The girl in question, who was intent on sacrificing to the goddess of fashion and wanted to arouse the envy of the other women, underwent a procedure that could well be called an operation. A man in charge of the operation began to pull the soft rings forcibly over the foot one by one, tearing several of them open. After about the fifteenth ring, the foot began to ache. At the fiftieth ring, the foot was so swollen and the pain so severe that the vain beauty begged them to refrain from putting on any more rings for the time being. The next day, a further 50 rings were put on, to the girl's moans of pain. The next eight days were devoted to healing the blisters, which had burst, and then within a further eight days, with a few breaks, a total of three hundred rings were joined together on one foot to form a thick bead. Similar rings are made from straw. The hunter wears rings made of elephant and giraffe tail hair tied in a very artificial knot around his ankles, neck and arms. The woman adorns her arm with iron, copper or brass rings, which always remain open, flat around the arm and are decorated with straight lines and triangular ornaments. Similar rings are made from hot-turned square iron, as found in graves from prehistoric Germanic times. Another type of ring, very fashionable in the last ten years, consists of smooth finger-thick brass and copper rings weighing 250 to 300 grams each, sometimes 6 to 7 of which are worn on each arm - i.e. up to 7 and 9 pounds. Certainly no small weight, especially when you consider that this type of ring is worn firmly on the arm and cannot be taken off unless you no longer want to wear it. With

Page 240

The earlobes of women are both pierced and matchstick-thick rods up to circular plates the size of a five-mark piece are carried in the holes, which are then gradually enlarged. Sometimes you can see flowers in the earlobes, usually a bright orange-red composite, which looks very pretty. Men usually only pierce one earlobe and expand the other one excessively. Feathers are used as jewelry in all sorts of ways, worn individually, united as crowns to form tufts, as short-cropped, almost completely closed round balls. One specialty is a finger-length bundle of straw feathers, which is worn on the head and attached to a round net like a brush. Otherwise, warriors and dancers adorn themselves with long-haired strips of fur cut from goatskin. As far as imported jewelry is concerned, the women only wear their white and red beads. Other colors are never worn. Fake jewelry is not accepted and not even worn as gifts. Neither are cowrie shells and bar-shaped pearls, which used to be popular. If a man wearing such old-fashioned jewelry appears from a remote village, the inhabitant of the capital says with a pitying smile: "min hojo wa päroni", that man comes from the border, i.e. he is a provincial. Even among the savages there is big city arrogance. The hairstyle is generally neglected by the Mjamuesi, as by all tribes living east of Tanganyika. The various forms have changed within the same limits since time immemorial. The simplest and at the same time cleanest form is to shave the head smooth with a sharp knife. The hair is shaved off when it has become so matted as a result of being left standing for too long that the cleaning procedure used to destroy the vermin living in it is no longer effective. This consists of rubbing the hair completely with clay and water and then leaving the dried clay in for another three to four days. This kills all living vermin and the young hatched from the eggs also perish, while the eggs themselves are not destroyed. Thus, despite the momentary successful destruction of the living insects, a new colonization of the head always occurs, the overgrowth of which is initially prevented by providing each other with completely ungenuine love services, which monkeys perform with such great preference and skill on any hair growth that presents itself. From the hair that grows back after shaving, all sorts of figures are often shaved out, crosses, arcs, triangles, spirals, concentric circles; or the hair is shaved away on both sides of the head to leave a thick bulge in the middle, which, gradually growing, takes on the exact shape of the old Bavarian helmet caterpillar. The correct Wanjamuesi=hairstyle is the mainsi pl. masinsi. The hair is left to stand on its own; the tangled locks of hair then often grow to the shoulders and have the appearance and thickness of poodle curls, surrounding the whole head in a dense fuzz. The hair is then completely soaked with oil, smeared with soot and clay, so that fat-soaked tubercles are formed. The women either shave off their hair completely like the men or wear masinsi. The most characteristic hairstyle, which suits them very well, is that the hair is shaved off from one ear to the other over the top of the head, often up to the vertebrae, and the remaining hair growth gradually shortens towards the nape of the neck. The skin color of the Wanjamuesi is generally dark brown, but there are gradations up to light coffee brown, but rarely and then mostly in women. On the other hand, a deep dark brown is found, but never black. The inner palm of the hand and the sole of the foot is yellowish white to brownish, the nails brownish pink. The lips, on the other hand, are usually lighter in color than the skin, but never red. The armpits and knee joints are also slightly lighter in color. It is very rare to find individuals with completely dark brown soles, palms, nails and darkly pigmented gums of the same color as the skin. This is then, like a very dark skin color in general, considered ugly; he is as black as soot or coal, one then says derisively of such a person. The skin, although completely exposed to the air, is very soft, velvety, and takes on a grayish-pale color in the cold, just as it does in death, so that the skin then appears to be powdered with ashes without losing its basic brown tone. A corpse in death does not have the horrifyingly gruesome appearance of a white corpse. The so often cited bad smell of the Reger could never be proven by the author to be specific. There are Wanjamuesi, and this in overwhelming majority, which do not smell at all, and others, especially those with flat feet, which by the way is relatively rarer than with us, which smell very strongly and foul, and one can find with us e.g. In factories, for example, such offensive fumes can be observed, perhaps to an even more unpleasant degree, than in the Reger. The Mjamuesi is generally very clean and never misses an opportunity to wash and bathe. The sparse beard is almost always shaved off, as is the armpit and the genitals, for reasons of cleanliness. The man has a beautiful, even figure, and his dark skin color is of great benefit to him, which does not make large unsightly areas stand out as much as with white skin, and which dark skin brings more warmth to the figure through many reflections, and above all does not create the feeling of unprotected nakedness. The woman is somewhat smaller than the man and has the same bone structure, delicate, often elegant forms, but always a broad face and very rarely a sharply curved nose. A constricted waist is considered unattractive, the neck must be long and the ears must stick out in order to be considered beautiful. A Mjamuesi once gave the author a very funny description of an English lady he had seen in Zanzibar: "I saw a white woman in Zanzibar; she had a lot of cloth fastened around her waist, like a Mrua (tribe from the upper Congo), but she wore most of the cloth gathered together at the back, whereas the Mrua wears it at the front. Her hands and feet were hidden in black and yellow sacks, and her whole body was covered in cloth. Her belly was the ugliest part of her, as thin as an insect, so that it could have been broken off without much effort. She had her breasts bound up so that she looked like a young girl; but that was only a lie, she was an old woman, quite old, in spite of her length I saw it. Her face was very white. On her head she wore a ngalla (warrior's headdress) of ostrich feathers, very high and made of beautiful feathers. (This seemed to interest the Mjamuesi the most and seemed the strangest, because he shook with laughter). She wore earrings like our women and her crotch was like that of a man. - I - sh! What a! But I would not have such an ugly woman, with a belt like an insect. Tribal insignia. The tribal insignia of the Wanjamuesi are tattooed and the teeth mutilated. Using a small bundle of needles or thorns, a strip starting at the forehead hair is pierced across the forehead to the tip of the lawn and two or even just one strip vertically across the temples to the level of the auditory canal; the wounds used to be rubbed with a herbal decoction, now with gunpowder, so that black strips two to four millimetres wide are created. Tooth mutilation consists of cutting off the inner corners of the upper central incisors, but not filing them, as is indicated everywhere. For this operation, a small singer-length iron chisel, a miniature form of the Wanjamnesi axe, is used and chips are gradually removed by striking with a small piece of wood. The procedure is said to be very painful as it causes extremely severe headaches at the back of the head. Incidentally, the teeth never become carious as a result, as the teeth of all black people are usually excellent, which is due to the careful care they take of them. They rinse their mouths before and after every painting session and often brush their teeth for hours with a finger-thick piece of tough wood with a brush-like edge. Women. For reasons of expediency, the Wanjamuesi practice polygamy in order to gain more labor for farming. The bridegroom pays the bride's father or her relatives an agreed sum of money, which consists of either exchangeable goods or cattle, small livestock and iron hoes. However, the bride does not become the property of the man. Divorce can always be pronounced if there are sufficient grounds, e.g. if the woman does not have children, because of adultery, because of syphilis, or if the two cannot get along. The Wanjamuesi women are not very fertile and give birth to 2, at most 3-4 children. The newborns are not black, but

Page 241

red, like our children, but with a slight brownish tinge, red=pink or yellow=pink. The sole and inner palm is always completely white, like ours, the genitals of a male newborn, the lips, the navel and the nipples of both sexes are brown. The skin then begins to darken in patches after a few days, and the child is only completely tanned after six to eight weeks. Children who are born with teeth are almost always killed immediately, as the Wanjamuesi superstition is that otherwise they will bring bad luck and disaster Two to three days after the birth, at which time the mother rises again, she begins to feed the baby with a thin flour porridge. The mother lays the child on her lap, holds her cupped left hand to her mouth and pours it full of porridge with the other hand using a scoop made of gourd, so that the mouth and nostrils are completely flooded and the child has to swallow if it does not want to choke. The way of life of the Wanjamuesi hardly differs from that of other Reger, the workload falls almost exclusively on the woman. When the farming is finished, the man resigns himself to idleness and at the most will only be called upon to fetch firewood in the evening or, if necessary, to build a new hut and carry the necessary materials. The Mjamuesi loves to wander around in the forest and search for all kinds of things. But if you ask him what he is looking for, he is usually at a loss for an answer, he doesn't know himself. Perhaps he lays snares for wild fowl, or, if he has got a shot of powder somewhere, he will try to shoot it at a piece of game in order to pass it a hundred and ninety times; or he is looking for honey. In the village he smokes hemp or tobacco all day long. If he knows any craft, he practices it, such as weaving, blacksmithing, wood carving, mat weaving. Others carve lances and arrow shafts, here and there a bow. About a quarter of the male population travels to the coast every year in April after the end of the farming season to enlist as porters. People only return at the end of October and in November. At home, the evenings are filled with dancing and singing or with entertainment, during which stories that have been repeated a thousand times are told. The women and the stomach usually play a leading role in the conversations and gossip is at its peak among the Wanjamuesi. Work of the woman. One of the tasks that women have to perform day after day with unrelenting diligence is the preparation of food, the main ingredient of which is flour, which is made by grinding and pounding. Most of the work is done with the laborious preparation of flour. After this work, girls and women go to the wells dug 1 to 2 meters deep into the ground to draw water and then cook the ugalli at home. Food. Ugalli is a thick, stiff, kneadable porridge made from sorghum, the main grain of the Wanjamuesi, without any spices or salt, and is extremely nutritious and tasty. Vegetables, sweet potatoes, pulses and unripe cooked bananas are enjoyed as a side dish. The Mjamuesi is most obsessed with meat, "like a hyena" is how he describes himself. Perhaps he is also so greedy for it because he cannot always ask for it. He works for the sake of meat, allows himself to be beaten and wounded, even beats his neighbor to death; he is actually afflicted with an eternal hunger for meat. Nevertheless, in Unjamuesi, almost no attention is paid to animal husbandry. They do keep goats, sheep, chickens, pigeons and the occasional duck, but only occasionally, so to speak. The Mjamuesi regard eggs of any kind as excrement, i.e. as something disgusting. Where Wanjamuesi keep cattle, they are only herd owners, while they always leave the herding and rearing to the Watusi or Wasukuma who have migrated to Unjamuesi. It would be quite wrong to include the Wanjamuesi among the cattle-breeding tribes. The Wanjamuesi enjoy the meat of all wild animals that are hunted or caught in pits, with the sole exception of that of the harness antelope (Tragelaphus scriptus Gray), called Mpongo by the Wanjamuesi. People claim that eating this meat causes ulcers and severe skin rashes, but this is based on pure imagination. When eating meat, the Mjamuesi do not care at all whether it is fresh or whether it has already passed into such a state that it can be called the stink of carrion. All meat is eaten either pierced, roasted or cooked after roasting, while stewing and roasting are completely unknown. The Mjamuesi eat everything, the muscle meat, the intestines, without spurning any of it, with the exception of the urine bladder. Even the skin, even that of buffaloes and elephants, is roasted over an open fire on wooden grates like the rest of the meat, and then eaten cooked, for which the excellent teeth of the blacks are indispensable. In addition to the above-mentioned foodstuffs, pombe, or beer, is also regarded as such, which is made from maize flour. sorghum or rice and is drunk with the sediment. Pombe, called malua, is highly carbonated and slightly intoxicating. It is a favorite drink and food at the same time and is consumed in enormous quantities. However, its effects are not harmful if it is not consumed as the sole food, as sometimes happens. Violent acts of drunkenness are quite rare, if only because the Wanjamuesi have the laudable custom of either retreating to the hut themselves or being escorted there by their drinking companions when they are intoxicated. However, delirium tremens sometimes occurs, more frequently among chiefs, who in many cases become so accustomed to the consumption of pombe that they no longer eat any other food. Beekeeping. The Mjamuesi also count honey among their foodstuffs, and like all blacks they are great admirers of it. They therefore also like to keep bees where the state is so well organized that they have some guarantee of being able to enjoy the honey they produce themselves. An approximately meter-long section of a tree trunk with a diameter of 40 cm is split in the middle and the two halves are hollowed out with thin walls, so that after joining them together by wrapping bast around them, a tube is formed, the two side openings of which are closed by straw-woven plates. A very small entrance hole is left in the center of each of these plates, while all other cracks and openings are well filled with clay. Inside such a tube, which is now the beehive, some honey is placed and then fixed in the branches of a tall tree, in a village or in the field. In most cases, a swarm of bees will quickly move into such a tube. The bees are removed by smoking when they have filled the tube with honey. Once the honey has been removed and the tube reattached to the old place, the bees return. (To be continued.) The oriental seminar in Verlin. When the German imperial government embarked on an energetic colonial policy and placed extended stretches of land under its control, the need to familiarize oneself with the language and customs of the new subjects soon became apparent. Of course, German merchants and industrialists had already been resident in distant countries of the East and West. But it was only since the acquisition of overseas possessions that the desire to study oriental languages in particular had become lively in wider circles. Outstanding statesmen and scholars began to warm to the cause. The fruit of their efforts was the founding of the Oriental seminary in Perlin. Even before this time, the study of oriental languages had been pursued eagerly in Germany. Wilbelm von Humboldt, Bopp. Pott, Bensey and others had paved the way for this research through their surprising comparisons of languages, to which they particularly drew on the Oriental languages (Sanskrit). Almost every German university has one or more departments for oriental languages. But the scientific-critical side of these studies is emphasized there. They are limited to language comparison, deciphering inscriptions and reading ancient literary works. The practical side, i.e. the reading and speaking of living languages, was given little or no consideration. The new institution was created to meet this need. The German government does not deserve the credit of having first founded such a seminar with practical exercises in the living Oriental languages. The "Erole pour les langues orientales vivantes" had already been established in France during the revolutionary period, an institute which, because of its exemplary facilities, often served as a model for the German one. - Although Russia does not have its own seminary, it has always held the cultivation of oriental science in high esteem. The imperial academy in St. Petersburg has a chair for almost every oriental language. - Austria, too, has always paid great attention to this study. The oriental manuscript collection in Vienna is one of the richest in Europe. - England, although of all European countries

Page 242

which dominates by far the most oriental peoples, strangely enough had no oriental seminary until recently. It was only in January of this year that such an institution was founded in London at the instigation of Oxford professor Max Müller. Once the Imperial Government had taken the matter in hand, the implementation of the new plan proceeded quickly. The institution was officially opened in October 1887 in the presence of the Minister of Education, von Gossler. No effort or expense had been spared to attract the most capable people from all sides. At the head of the Seminari was the deserving scholar Dr. Eduard Sachau, professor at the university and member of the Academy of Sciences in Berlin. His main work, the edition and translation of the Albiruni), had already earned him a notable reputation among European scholars. In addition to idm, there are three lecturers for Chinese, two for Japanese, three for Arabic, two for Suabeli (the most important language in East Africa) and one for Hindustani (Indian and Persian). More than half of the teachers are indigenous people so that the students have the opportunity to fully master the oral and written use of one of the languages). Chinese and Arabic are most favored. The lectures on Hindostani and Persian, on the other hand, are very poorly attended. The main reason for this is probably that these languages are of little practical value to the Germans. In India and the neighboring districts, one can get by everywhere with English. The fact that the German government had met a real need by founding the Oriental Seminary is evident from the frequency with which this institute enjoyed last winter. According to the official report, the total number of students was 115. 56 of these were lawyers, i.e. those who wanted to dedicate themselves to the consular career; 15 belonged to the philosophical=medical faculty; 4 to the tbeological (missionaries); 23 were merchants, 3 engineers, 5 officers. The others belonged to different professions. Of course, a life plan has also been drawn up, according to which work is carried out: Knowledge of grammar and of that part of the vocabulary which is most used in daily oral and written usage Acquaintance with the most frequently occurring documents of a public and private nature; teaching of the religion, customs and traditions of the country concerned. The Oriental Seminary is primarily intended to train interpreters for the diplomatic service. However, as we mentioned above, many young people, especially from the merchant class, also take part in these exercises. At the examination held last August, three bank officials successfully passed the Chinese language exam and then joined the German East Asian Bank in China. Especially from the industrial areas of the Rhineland and Westphalia, as well as from the Hanseatic cities, many young merchants are now coming to Berlin to take part in the seminar. Of course, the increased influx will gradually lead to an expansion of the institute. As the recently published program shows, lessons in Modern Greek and Spanish have already been added. The latter in particular has recently become extremely important for the merchant class. The influx of Germans to the central and southern states of America has, as the statistics show, increased considerably in recent years. One natural consequence of this is the increase in the number of professional confulats in these countries. As can be seen from the journals, other European countries are looking with envy and admiration at the young, flourishing institute. Outstanding foreign scholars cannot urge the government warmly enough to support such institutions. And indeed, the knowledge of living oriental languages is of outstanding importance for diplomacy, trade and industry. The competition being fought today in the economic and political field is not an easy one. However, knowledge of the language and customs of the countries with which one comes into contact is an important tool. The spoken word has a completely different effect than if you first have to use the mediation of a third party as interpreter, quite apart from the fact that you cannot always be sure of the loyalty and reliability of such an interpreter. Hans Altona. Correspondence. Deli, Sumatra, August 5, 1890. I have just read a correspondence from German New Guinea in No. 13 of June 21 of your esteemed newspaper, which requires some correction. *) Albiruni, a Persian Muslim in the 11th century, had accompanied Sultan Muhamed on his conquest of India. He gives us important information about the history, religion and literature of the inhabitants there. *) Resigned from the board of the seminary after the contract expired: The lecturer of North Chinese and Mandarin dialect Mr. Knei ring, the lecturer of South Chinese Mr. Pan Fei Sching, the lecturer of Japanese Mr. Jnonvs and the previous representative of the Turkish language Mr. Manissadjian. The arrival of two Chinese editors is expected during the fall months. In addition, Mr. J. Sango has been appointed to teach Javanese and Dr. Karl Foy from Ludwigslust in Mecklenburg has been appointed to teach Turkish; he has already worked successfully as a Turkish teacher in the circles of the Turkish embassy in Constantinople.
Firstly, the intention that I was expected to "make a start" in the vicinity of Siar with six large tobacco plantations and 600 to 1000 Chinese workers has been taken out of the air. Secondly, nowhere did I call for a fortnightly connection with Java, as useful as this could be for German New Guinea. Thirdly, as far as the concession of the New Guinea Company is concerned, the reporter was mistaken. He must have been completely unaware that I undertook the great journey not only on behalf of our board in Bremen, but also specifically at the request of the New Guinea Company. However, I am happy to join in the rest of the report and am pleased to recall the many expeditions I undertook not only in the Siar region, but also along the rest of the coast of Kaiser Wilhelmsland. I owe the greatest part of the success of these mostly difficult expeditions to Mr. Missionary Scheit, with whom I shared the discomforts of bush life, but also many an interesting experience. As far as the conditions for tobacco cultivation and the introduction of a more extensive tobacco dew in German New Guinea are concerned, the future will teach us whether the correspondent's opinion is correct. H. C. Bluntschli. Communications from the Society. (In honour of Dr. Peters) the Munich branch organized a festive evening in the hall of the Arzberger Keller on 4 September, which was very well attended. Professor Dr. v. Kupffer, the first chairman of the association, who was unable to attend, was represented by the treasurer, Mr. v. Pfister, who opened the series of speeches; Dr. Götz gave a lengthy account of Peter's expeditions, which had achieved great things with small means. The latter's reply first expressed his warm thanks for the sympathetic reception; then followed interesting reports on his journeys and experiences; finally, he spoke in enthusiastic and inspiring words about the ideal, moral, national and humane motives which he himself had followed in his great, self-chosen task, and by which he wanted to see the entire German cultural mission in Africa supported, conditioned and dominated. The main purpose was not to hoist the black-white-red flag over as much of the African continent as possible; the main thing for the heart of Europe, with its high level of Christian education there in the land of the Negro peoples with such a low level of culture, was to open up the paths of art, education and morality to these peoples, to make them partakers of the blessings of a higher culture. Dr. Peters commented on the German-English agreement as follows: According to the treaty, Germany and England have completely equal rights in Uganda and the entire Victoria-Nyanza region with regard to freedom of trade and settlement. He himself (Peters) had been aware from the outset that he could not conclude a protectorate treaty with Uganda which, on the one hand, would not be approved in Germany and, on the other, would have imposed an immense amount of political and economic obligations on Germany. It was therefore only a matter of securing Germany those rights in Uganda which German trade there required. This had been achieved. He had persuaded the King to sign the Congo Act. If England were to declare the protectorate in future, which was not in doubt, it would always have to reckon with the dislike of the Uganda King, who had told him (Peters) and had also declared in a public council meeting that he was prepared to grant all whites freedom of trade and settlement, but wanted no one's protectorate, least of all that of the English. Stauley had passed him by without bringing him any shells. Jackson had lain near him for three months with his large expedition without lifting a hand for him; the Germans had brought him help. If a protectorate at all, then he would accept a German one. Peters went on to explain that trade there had been taking the southward route via the Victoria-Nyanza since time immemorial and that therefore the nation that controlled the southern shore of the lake would always have an advantage. The Anglo-German agreement had secured for Germany the position in Uganda that Peters was striving for, which had so far been too little known and too little considered in Germany; he hoped that this declaration would contribute to at least this part of the treaty being viewed more favorably. If Stanley had compared Germany's remaining share in East Africa with a trouser button in relation to a new suit, then he, Peters, could imagine circumstances in which the trouser button would be more desirable and necessary than the new suit. - Dr. Peters spent some time in Wildbad The North Australian newspaper from Brisbane recently carried a correspondence from New Guinea, the concluding sentences of which read: "The best recommendation that the protectorate has received is probably that the German-Swiss Plantation Company, one of the most important tobacco plantations in Sumatra, has sent its representative here to inspect the country, and that a new company for tobacco culture in Kaiser Wilhelmsland is being formed in Germany as a result of its extraordinarily favorable reports. Let us hope that the cautious German capitalists will finally overcome their mistrust and invest their money in German ventures. There is every prospect of success here, and even of early success, but little is known of New Guinea in Germany, the noise in the other colonies attracts all eyes and makes people overlook the local protectorate. But of course the establishment of a prositadl plantation, as everywhere in tropical colonies where the white man cannot farm himself and where the climate is unsuitable, requires money, money and more money.
