 Meeting of November 18, 1893 Chairman: Mr. R. Vircliow.  (1) The Society has lost several very valuable members since our last meeting. Almost on the same day, Dr. Moritz Meyer, Privy Medical Councillor, and Gustav Miitzel, animal painter, died, the former on October 30, 71, the latter on October 29, only 54 years old. They were old and loyal members of our cooperative, whom we often saw in our midst as long as their health lasted. Meyer had attained an outstanding position in his chosen specialty; almost from its inception he had become the recognized representative of electrotherapy, not only in our city, but as a result of his successful literary activities far beyond our fatherland. Unfortunately, a serious abdominal ailment made his last years rather sad. Mützel was even closer to society as such.  His beautiful talent in the artistic depiction of animals, especially mammals, allowed him to take full advantage of the new and rich opportunity to observe living anthropoids. His brush fixed the image of many of the apes brought to us with a fidelity that will be useful for our studies for a long time to come. We will remember him often. - It is with deep sorrow that we remember the irreplaceable loss suffered not only by our society but also by the ethnological museum through the sudden death of Banquier Isidor Richter. For years, as the leading member of the Ethnological Committee, he initiated and supervised the far-reaching undertakings necessary for the study of primitive peoples and the collection of their peculiar products. It was he who was able to raise the funds to make Capt. Jacobsen's important missions to Northwest America, the Amur and the Malay Archipelago possible, and in recent months he had decided to take on new tasks for which private resources could not be spared. He supported Mr. M. Uhle's mission to Bolivia and the continuation of the investigations in Malacca, which we had entrusted to Mr. Vaughan Stevens. Our confidence in the successful completion of these significant undertakings was complete since we had been able to place the business concerns in the hands of such a skillful and well-situated man. Just a few days before his death, we saw him in such a good mood and so energetically active that we could forget how long and severely he had been affected by a chronic eye condition that almost led to blindness and by diabetes. He died, aged only 63, on the night of March 14 as the result of an unfortunate fall from a flight of stairs. In the history of the Ethnological Museum and in our own memory, the memory of this rare man will remain unforgotten. -

 (2) The following are registered as new members:  Mr. Colonel-Lieutenant (ret.) Frobenius, Charlottenburg.  " Stud. med. Bloch, Berlin.  " Director Härche, Prankenstein (Silesia).  " Priyatdocent Dr. med. C. Posner, Berlin.  (3) To our great sadness, Mr. Steinthal has seen fit to resign his long-standing office as a member of the Committee. Even when his anniversary was to be celebrated a few months ago, he was unable to receive the Society's representative. As he wrote very emotionally on the 8th of this month, the hope he harbored in the summer that he would regain his full strength by the winter was not fulfilled. Unfortunately, the Board and the Committee felt compelled not to oppose his decision, as the interests of the Society urgently require the members of both representative bodies to be complete and active. In the meantime, our heartfelt wishes that the highly esteemed scholar will soon be able to resume his work will not fall silent.  At its meeting today, the committee co-opted a new member in accordance with § 34 of the statutes. Mr. R. v. Kaufmann, who was elected, accepts the election. - (4) The following guests are present at the meeting and are welcomed by the Chairman: Dr. Sander, who will soon be leaving for Southwest Africa, the Africa travelers Count Schweinitz and Lieutenant Meyer, Privy Councillors Gurlt and Gaupp. - (5) Dr. P. Stuhlmann, who is starting his return journey to East Africa this evening, sends his farewell greetings. His mission this time is to record the coastal areas. The first volume of his great travel book, which he wrote himself and which contains valuable original communications from Em in Pasha, has just been completed. - (6) The corresponding member, Mr. Bernhard Ornstein, reports from Munich, October 9, that he will soon begin his journey home to Athens. - (7) The corresponding member, Mr. G. Rad de, reports from Tbilisi, September 4/16, his return from the journey to the western Caucasus, which took up his time from the end of March. He plans to leave again at the beginning of May in order to spend the summer touring the eastern lowlands, the Dagestan pass and the west coast of the Caspian Sea as far as Baku. - (8) Mr. Paul Ascherson reports on the Mandragora sent in from the Dardanelles by Mr. Prank Calvert (p. 369).  The result of the microscopic examination of a surface sample carried out by my assistant Mr. Graebner showed complete conformity of the tissue with Mandragoras, especially in the characteristic shape of the starch grains, whereas those of Bryonia, which was also examined, show a deviating shape. It therefore appears that this mandrake originates from an unusually large and thick root, the intact surface of which is also visible in the lower part.


Page 407

 of the group can be proven to have been made. On the other hand, it turned out that this group has been more artificially worked on than the Mandragoras mandrakes known to me, namely Luschan's and mine. Depressions, which were disturbing in the modeling of two human figures, are filled with an inorganic mass (probably gypsum) and to cover this procedure, the whole structure is covered with a color (Rüthel?), which can be rubbed off with a wet pinger, which is not the case with my mandrake, which comes from Schweinfurth's servant Tanus. In this case the reddish-brown parbe is eight. - (9) On November 17, Mr. A. Nehring sent the following communication on fossil lion remains from Thiede, Rüheland, Scharzfeld, Quedlinburg, Westeregeln and Hameln.  In the opening speech of the 24th general meeting of the German Anthropological Society in Hanover, which Mr. R. Virchow gave on Monday, August 7, 1893, the following is also mentioned. August 1893, the former presence of the lion in Germany is also discussed1) ; it says the following: "For even if the lion came here in prehistoric times, as we know from the finds in the caves, - the cave lion also existed in Westphalia and Thuringia, - it has nevertheless perished afterwards, and whether a cave lion has been seen by a human being at all has not been established with complete certainty."  I would like to take the liberty of saying that the so-called cave lion (Felis spelaea) not only existed in Thuringia and Westphalia, but also in the Duchy of Brunswick (near Thiede and Rübeland), in the province of Hanover (near Scharzfeld a. Harz and Hameln a. d. W.), as well as in the province of Saxony (near Quedlinburg and Westeregeln) in prehistoric times.  I can report the following about the lion remains of Thiede (mostly based on my own observations). In the early summer of 1873, in the eastern part of Rover's Gypsbruch, allegedly about 8-10 feet deep in the loess-like masses deposited there, a large number of apparently related skeletal parts of a large predatory animal were found. According to the workers, which of course I cannot vouch for, it was a whole skeleton with skull. Unfortunately, it was thrown away; only the left lower jaw, which was quite heavily damaged, came into the hands of the owner of the Gyps fragment (Mr. Rover), who lent it to me for some time for examination. At that time I drew the following sketch (Fig. 1) of the object, at about 4/5 natural size.  If you compare this sketch with a recent lion lower jaw or with the illustrations of the lower jaw of a Felis spelaea in Schmerling, Rech, sur 1. oss. foss. dans les cavernes de la province de Liege, 1833, Tome II, PI. 14, Fig. 11 or in Boyd Dawkins andSanford, British Pleistocene Mammalia, London 1866, PI. I, one can easily convince oneself of the correctness of the determination. The length of the then completely intact row of molars2) on the fossil lower jaw of Thiede was 80 mm, if the 3 molars are added to 1) Correspondenzblatt der deutschen Gesellschaft für Anthropologie, Ethnologie und Urgeschichte, 1893, p. 76. 2) Unfortunately, the meat tooth (sectorius), i.e. the last molar, on the jaw in question was later smashed in the Rover collection due to careless handling. My sketch below shows it faithfully as it was before.


Page 408

 measured at the tooth crowns; measured at the alveoli, the length of the molar row was 75 mm').  Figure 1. 4/s. Lower jaw of a fossil lion from Thiede.  Figure 2: This piece was the first evidence of the occurrence of the so-called. Cave lion, the remains of which are by no means restricted to caves, was established by me for the Pleistocene deposits of the Thiede Gypsbruch. In April 1880, during clearing work in the eastern part of the Gyps quarry, lion remains came to light again; they were found about 18 -19 feet below the surface, as I can state with certainty on the basis of my own observations, together with mammoth, rhinoceros and horse remains, embedded in a loess-like material. The lion remains that came into my hands were: a well-preserved upper caninus, a lamellar femur, a tibia, a calcaneus, a metatarsus, a phalanx.  The upper canine, which only came into my hands on loan, is shown in its natural size in Fig. 2, based on an exact drawing I made at the time; it measured 110 mm from the somewhat worn tip of the dental crown to the end of the root. The tibia, which lacked the upper part of the joint, had a length of 290 mm, as far as it was preserved. The well-preserved calcaneus, measured on the outside, had a length of 112 mm; the 4th metatarsus was 133 mm long.  Mr. A. Wollemann, too, if I am not mistaken, has in 1880 and 1881 a number of lion remains 1) On the skull of a very strong male lion of the present day, which the zoological collection of the Landwirthsch. Hochschule, which is under my control, also has a lower row of molars measuring 76 mm.


Page 409

 found in the eastern wall of the Thieder Gypsbruch. Finally, in April 1890, I obtained 2 well-preserved lumbar vertebrae and a calcaneus of the same species in the Thieder Gypsbruch, which had been excavated by the workers shortly before in the loess-like deposits of the east wall.  The determination of all those remains, some of which I found myself and some of which I had in my hands for examination, has been carried out by me with complete accuracy, so that there can be no doubt about the actual presence of remains of Felis spelaea near Thiede. Apart from the 3 specimens found in 1890, which I still possess, the lion remains I found there earlier are partly in the Ducal Natural History Museum in Brunswick, partly in the local Geological State Institute and can therefore be checked for the correctness of the determination.  "From Rübeland in the Harz Mountains I have become aware of a well-preserved lower jaw of Felis spelaea; it comes from the "Hermannshöhle" and is in the Herzogl. Naturhistorisches Museum in Braunschweig. (See W. Blasius, Neue Knochenfunde in den Höhlen bei Rübeland, in Sitzungsber. d. Verein f. Naturwissenschaft zu Braunschweig of November 27, 1890.) Furthermore, Mr. Struckmann has excavated a number of undoubted remains of Felis spelaea in the Einhornhöhle near Scharzfeld am Harz. [See Struc mann, die Einhornhöhle u. s. w. in Arch. f. Anthropol., vol. 15, Sep.-Abdr., p. 3]1) From the diluvial deposits of the Seweckenberg near Quedlinburg a. H., Giebel once unearthed and discussed remains of the same species. (See Giebel, Fauna d. Vorwelt, I, p. 36ff.) From the diluvial deposits of the Gypsberg near Westeregeln I know of 2 objects that undoubtedly belong to Felis spelaea, namely: 1. a well-preserved radius in the Mineralogical Museum of the local university, and 2. the fragment of an upper jaw with the canine and the nearest incisor in the collection under my control. According to Giebel, remains of Felis spelaea have been found several times near "Westeregeln.  Finally, I would like to mention a well-preserved radius that Mr. Amtsrath Dr. Struc mann in Hanover received a few years ago from a gravelly diluvial deposit in the area around Hamelin and sent to me for identification.  As far as the question of the contemporaneity of humans with Felis spelaea is concerned, I cannot but affirm this on the basis of my excavations in the Thieder Gypsbruch. In this regard, I refer to my information "on Paleolithic flint tools from the Diluvi deposits of Thiede", which are printed in the Verhandlungen unserer Gesellschaft of April 13, 1889, pp. 357-363.  The flint tools in question were found (with the exception of one piece) partly at the same level as Felis spelaea, partly even deeper; I was unable to find any valid reasons during my excavations for assuming a possible later mixing of the former with the latter.  I have provided more details on this in a forthcoming treatise entitled "Uebe die Gleichzeitigkeit des Menschen mit Hyaena spelaea". - (10) Mr. Lissauer talks about three Bronze Age finds from the district of Könitz in West Prenssen.  In the course of this year, the West Prussian Provincial Museum in Danzig came into possession of three bronze finds from the district of Könitz, which not only 1) Cf. Verhau dl. 1872. p. 254, note. p. 273, Amnerk. (Reel.)


Page 410

 are important for the prehistory of the province, but may also claim a more general interest. Thanks to the liberal concession of the director, Prof. Conwentz, it was possible to demonstrate all the finds at the meeting.  I. In the village of Bruss, the following objects were found on the field of the cartwright Mr. Lange in 1881, without any attention being paid at the time to whether there were remains of clay vessels or bones of any kind. Director Conwentz saw the find in its present form as early as 1884, but was only able to acquire it for the museum in that year.  The following pieces belong to it: 1. a dagger in 2 fragments (Fig. 1), one of which consists of the handle and the uppermost part of the blade, the other of the lower part of the same; the middle piece is missing. The surface as a whole is rough, dirty brown-red, only covered with an almost vitriol-green patina in some places; in others, where the casting has obviously suffered from air bubbles, the metal is conspicuously porous, in still others already very corroded by oxidation. It is therefore not possible to determine the exact dimensions.


Page 411

 The handle (up to the middle of the crescent-shaped attachment to the blade) is 77 mm long. The handle column is flat, of oval cross-section and completely ornamented with parallel cross-ribs, some of which have already been destroyed; at the top is a narrow, flat, originally also oval, but now irregularly shaped knob, which protrudes slightly over the edge of the handle column, while at the bottom a flat and smooth extension, which surrounds the blade in the middle in an arch and is set off in a straight line to the sides, completes the handle.  The blade shows a strong central rib on both sides and, judging by the preserved pieces, was of a "triangular" shape; the preserved part of the blade is about 73 mm long, making the dagger as a whole 15 cm long. Since the similar but completely preserved daggers of the same type (see below) show a length of 19 - 31 cm, it is likely that the length of the missing middle piece here was at least 4 cm.  The entire dagger was cast in one piece, but, as already mentioned, the casting was not done well due to the many air bubbles, as the entire work, especially on the crescent-shaped blade and pommel, testifies to a lack of skill. Nevertheless, the piece cannot be declared unfinished or not intended for actual use, as the decoration of the handle column is carefully executed.  Since the epoch-making publication of "the Pile find in Scania by Montelius", we have known that daggers such as this one from Bruss are to be regarded as Nordic replicas of those daggers originally imported from Italy, which are "triangular" in shape, with sometimes wide, sometimes narrow blades, of perfect technique and with tasteful decoration, in which the handle and blade are always specially cast and then joined together by rivets. In the first attempt to reproduce these precious foreign "weapons", the whole was cast in one piece; nevertheless, not only the crescent-shaped overlay of the blade through the handle, but often also the rivets in the form of flat bosses were molded and cast as well.  Montelius gave a complete overview of the area in which these "triangular" daggers were found and established their date: according to this, they belong to the earliest Bronze Age, a view which is now generally accepted. Such daggers are known not only from Italy, but also from Britain, France, Switzerland, the Rhine, the province of Saxony, Meklenburg, Brandenburg, West Prussia, Posen and Austria.  I have already illustrated and described a dagger of this shape from West Prussia3) , which was also cast here, namely from the tumulus of Prüssau, district of Neu stadt; the present example from Bruss is therefore the second from this province - apart from the beautiful imported pieces of Italic origin from Daber3), district of Deutsch-Krone.  These very first beginnings of an indigenous casting technique are of such great importance for our understanding of the Bronze Age that every newly discovered piece must be regarded as an important contribution to our prehistory.  - "As regards especially the specimens which are cast in one piece, 1) K.

 so far only 1 from Neuenheiligen, Prov. Saxony1) 10 from Meklenburg2) (2 from Malchin, 5 from Stubbendorf, 2 from Neu-Baudorf and 1 from an unknown location), 1 from Wildberg, Province of Brandenburg3), 1 from Jarmen in Western Pomerania3), 3 from the Province of Pcsen4) (2 from Granowo and 1 from Polnisch-Presse), finally 2 from West Prussia [1 from Prüssau5) and 1 from Bruss], - a total of 18 have thus become known, including 5 which seem to have rivets, namely 2 from Neu-Baudorf, 2 from Granowo and 1 from Prüssau. Perhaps this overview will encourage you to draw attention to other examples that are still known to me, but are certainly still in existence!  The ornamentation on the Bruss dagger was particularly popular for these indigenous pieces: identical parallel cross bands either cover the entire surface of the hilt column without interruption, as in Malchin, Stubbendorf, Wildberg and Polnisch-Presse, or arranged in groups, as in Jarmen and Granowo. But even this is only an imitation of the ornament often observed on imported Italian daggers.  If the dagger from Bruss already deserves our special interest for the reasons mentioned, this is considerably increased by the fact that, according to the chemical analysis of Mr. Helm in Gdansk, it consists almost of pure copper: at least the other components found in it are present in such small quantities that we can only regard them as accidental impurities. Mr. Helm writes to me about this: "The dagger consists almost of pure copper; those parts which were presented to me for examination were heavily oxidized, the oxide layer had in part penetrated deep into the metal, so that I was unable to remove it completely, hence the high content of oxygen, etc. I determined that 100 parts of the dagger were made of pure copper.  I determined in 100 parts of the metal  94.10 parts copper, 1.22 " silver, 0.24 " tin, 0.18 " arsenic, 0.26 " nickel, 0.26 " iron, traces of lead, 3.74 parts loss, carbonic acid, oxygen and hydrate water Prehistoric finds of copper daggers have already been made many times and compiled by Much6) , especially from Austria, Hungary, Switzerland, France, Spain, Portugal and Britain, more rarely from Italy, and from Germany only once so far from the Mündl in Baden; For northern Germany and the whole of northern Europe, the K dagger from Bruss is the first to be confirmed as such by chemical analysis7). We will come back to this in the discussion of the overall find.  1) Montelius, Om Tidsbestämning, p. 181. 2) Lisch, Mecklenburg. Jahrb. Bd. 26. p. 138 and 145. 3) R.

 2. a shaft celt of the shape of the flat axe (Fig. 2), without any elevation at the edge, thus like Montelius' type A1). The surface is covered with the same rough, green patina and the cutting edge is the same brown-red color as the copper dagger, but no analysis has yet been made of it.  The shape is slender, the blade rather thin with somewhat curved sides, the cutting edge curved, the upper edge shows a small cut-out, as is evidently produced; however, this can no longer be stated with certainty, as later damage is clearly visible there as well as on the cutting edge. The greatest length is about 13.2 cm, the greatest width (at the cutting edge) about 4 cm, the smallest about 1.5 cm, the greatest thickness about 8 mm, the weight 119 g. - Very similar in shape is a flat celt from Klanin, Kr. Putzig in West Prussia, which I have already described and illustrated earlier2) ; only this one is smaller and already shows a low rim in its upper part. - Flat axes made of copper and bronze are known to be extremely widespread throughout Europe and are classified by Montelius') as the oldest tools of the Bronze Age, and by Much3) as belonging to the "Copper Age".  3) Three fragments of smooth, simple arm rings (Fig. 3), which show the same patina and the same color on the fracture surface as the other two objects. They are up to 14 mm thick in the middle and taper towards the ends. Both the shape of the rings, as far as can be deduced from the existing pieces, and the cross-section are approximately elliptical.  We have also come across and described rings of this type from various sites in western Prussia4) , for example from Prüssau, Kr. Neustadt, from Marzdorf, Kr. But they also occur in many other places5) in northern Germany and Scandinavia together with the oldest bronzes, for example in the finds from Pile6) in Scania, from Heinrichshagen7) in Meklenburg Strelitz, from Lunow8) in Brandenburg, from Granowo9) in Posen and others, and therefore also belong to the earliest Bronze Age.  4) An amber bead (Fig. 4) in the shape of an almost round, biconvex lens. Apparently, when it was found, it was completely covered with a dirty brown rind, which was later largely chipped off, so that it now appears completely uneven and without ornamentation. It is drilled through somewhat ex centrically in such a way that the openings on both sides are not vertically above each other and the drill holes meet at an obtuse angle; the drill channel as a whole is therefore oblique and somewhat kinked (Fig. 4a), as was so often the case when drilling with flint instruments. Where the drill holes on both sides meet in the orifice, a small protruding ledge has been preserved, while the characteristic parallel hoops produced by the flint drill are still clearly visible both on the walls of the canal and around the orifices. The largest diameter of the lens is between 50 and 53 mm, the 1) Om Tidsbestämning, p. 52, pl. I, fig. 1. 2) Alterth. d. Bronzezeit, p. 8, pl.

Page 414

 The drill holes themselves are 8 -10 mm wide, the greatest thickness in the center is about 15 mm.  Amber lenses of this shape have so far been found almost exclusively at Neolithic sites. I myself have described and illustrated one of these from the Neolithic graves of Gross Morin, district of Inowraclaw1), Tischler and Klebs2) have described several from East Prussia and shown their relationship to the buttons with a V-shaped hole and to the amber disks; in Rzeszynck, district of Strelno3) such a lens was found. Strelno3) such an amber disk even lay together with 2 flat flint axes in a "cujavishen" grave; Rud. Yirchow4) also describes a similar amber ornament from a Neolithic grave near Janischewek, which v. Erckert had uncovered, Kirkor5) likewise from a Neolithic grave of Kociubince and Ossowski") from a Neolithic kurgan of Uwisla in eastern Galicia. Only in Polish-Presse'), Kr. Kosten, was an amber lens, like the present one from Bruss, found together with 3 triangular daggers and a double bronze chisel.  If we look at this find as a whole, it is clear from the previous description that it is not isolated. The combination of daggers, shaft celts and very specific jewelry, in varying numbers, is found in several parallel finds from the oldest Bronze Age, not only in Scandinavia, where they are rarer according to Montelius8) , but especially in northern Germany. They obviously represent the entire inventory of the richest people of that time, when metal began to displace stone. In Stubbendorf, as in Neu-Bauhof in Meklenburg, in Neuenheiligen and Leubingen9) in the province of Saxony, in Lunow in Brandenburg, in Granowo and Polnisch-Presse in Posen, in Prüssau and Bruss in "West-Prussia, as in Pile in Scania, we find "triangular" daggers, shaft celts or chisels, completely flat or with a low rim - only in Neu Bauhof was the celt missing - together with jewelry of the oldest forms.  Apart from the daggers, there are probably also sword staffs and once (in Leubingen) a serpentine hammer. - Among the ornaments, the simple thick rings as shown in Fig. 3, sometimes open, sometimes closed, are the most common; the only other objects found are very wide, ribbed bracelets10), loop-shaped spiral rings (also made of gold), simple needles12) and so-called "sabre needles",3) and finally amber lenses, as in Fig. 4. 1) Zeitschr. f.

 either purely Neolithic objects or bronzes of the oldest forms (apart from the few gold rings): only in Stubbendorf and Bruss does copper also occur.  As far as the chronology of this whole group of finds is concerned, it is therefore self-evident that they all belong to the "early" Bronze Age; however, the simultaneous occurrence of the copper dagger and the Neolithic amber jewelry in the Bruss find justifies us in placing the age of these even more firmly in the transitional period from the Neolithic to the metal culture.  In this respect, the Bruss find complements that of Janischewek in Cuyavia, where a small copper metal plate was discovered in a Neolithic grave, the significance of which was immediately highly valued by R. Virchow1); its use at that time for the chronology of the Metal Age is brilliantly confirmed by the present Bruss find2).  IL The second find is a bronze sword (Fig. 5), which was unearthed in Karszin-Gurki in 1884. For the most part it has a dirty yellow-brown color and is only covered with green patina in some places; the cutting edge is damaged on both sides by sharp blows and the tip is bent, - otherwise the sword is well preserved.  It consists of the short handle and the blade, the handle of the handle spike and the wider lower connecting piece; the latter meets the likewise widened upper part of the blade at an angle on the side, while slightly below this point the imprint of a transverse line stands out on the surface of the blade.  The blade is narrow, scabbard-like, and shows a fairly broad, flatly curved rib in the middle, which narrows towards the tip and is bordered on both sides by 2 blood grooves; however, the lines in the lower part become indistinct. Laterally, the blade quickly tapers to the sharp edge, which appears to be particularly hammered out. The edge is slightly curved immediately below the hilt, but it remains completely straight. The length of the blade is 57.5 cm, its greatest width is 3.7 cm at the top at the base of the handle and 2.2 cm further down under the tang, the greatest thickness is about 7 mm.  The hilt spike is short, irregularly angular, flattened at the upper end, both on the surface and on the tip (perhaps only after discovery); the cast seams on both sides are not smoothed, but completely preserved. Its length is about 4.7 cm, - that of the whole sword thus about 62.2 cm.  I am only aware of two swords of the same shape, with a sword-like blade: one in the local Royal Museum of Ethnology3) from an unknown location, which even corresponds to the present one in its main dimensions, and a second in Copenhagen'), y6 which comes from Ravnsburg Voldsted on Lolland and is somewhat 1) This Verhandl. 1880, p. 330 and 1881, p. 103. 2) I subsequently learned from Mr. Helm that the flat celt (Fig. 2) also contained only 2.04 pCt. and the ring (Fig. 3) only traces of tin.  3) Bastian and Voss, Die Bronzeschwerter u. s. w.

 is longer. A sword from Upland, which Montelius1) depicts, also has such a narrow sword-like blade and a handle spike, around which a bronze grip with antennae is placed: this alone surrounds the blade with a half-moon shaped cut-out, while the blade from Karszin clearly shows the imprint of a more straight handle attachment. - On the other hand, similar forms with various modifications occur more frequently and form a well characterized group that is widespread in the north. These modifications only affect the blade. Either the blade as a whole is somewhat curved, or it shows only a narrow central rib without any lines, or it becomes somewhat wider, or the edges are slightly curved, - but it always remains narrow in relation to its length and connects with the usually unsmoothed hilt on both sides at an "angle, while across the surface in this area there is usually an almost straight line.  The swords in this group are almost all of low quality. Not only the Royal Museum of Ethnology2) owns several swords belonging to this group (from Schwachenwalde and Pankow in Brandenburg, from Sorenbohm, Neu stettin, Anklam, Putbus in Pomerania and others), - they also occur frequently in Denmark, Meklenburg, Lübeck, Schleswig-Holstein and Hanover, as Sophus Müller3) has proven.  The hilt spike was intended to hold the actual wooden or horn hilt and was therefore not freed from the cast seams, as these were covered anyway and contributed to the greater attachment of the hilt. However, it is not uncommon to find swords that still have a special beating around the actual handle4), which ends at the bottom with a specially cast ring, like a cuff; sometimes only this ring alone is preserved, as on the sword from Stölln5) in the Kgl. Museum für Völkerkunde, from Oersberg6), Angeln, in the Museum zu Kiel, etc. Apparently, the more or less straight imprint between hilt and blade (Fig. 5) on many swords of this group also derives from such a ring-shaped fitting, which was later lost.  Those swords on which the hilt fittings have been completely preserved show that they are only Nordic imitations of models from south-eastern countries, especially Bohemia and Hungary, which do not have a hilt spike but a narrow hilt tongue, but otherwise have similar fittings and blades, as Sophus Müller7) has convincingly demonstrated.  As far as chronology is concerned, Müller, like Montelius8), rightly place these forms in the "younger" Bronze Age, Montelius specifically in his 4th period.  III The third bronze find was unearthed in Friedrichsbruch in 1886: it is visibly a bog find, to which the following 4 pieces belong: 1) Svenska Pornsaber, Stockholm 1872. p. 48, Pig. 155. 2) Bastian and Voss a. a. 0. pl.

 but the dimensions can only be approximate. A hole for a nail to fasten the shank is not visible on the preserved part.  4. a fragment of a ring or similar object, a piece of which has been filed off for analysis.  The chronology of this find from Friedrichsbruch is sufficiently determined by the sword and the hollow celt: like the sword (Fig. 5), it belongs to the "younger" Bronze Age of western Prussia and represents an important addition to our previous knowledge of this period1).  Finally, it is a pleasant duty for me to thank Mr. Director Conwentz in Danzig for his kind permission to present these finds here. - (11) Mr. A. v. Heyden shows a rosary.  This object was found in the cloister of the collegiate church in Berchte gaden. Work had been carried out on the floor of the cloister a long time ago and this ring, which I only recently acquired from a dealer, was found while clearing away debris and bone remains.  The object seems to be a very different, peculiar form of a so-called middle rosary, which usually consists of 6 X 10+3 M and 7 paternoster beads. Instead of the Marian beads, R of bone are attached to a leather strip. The paternoster beads between decades are of black glass. Rings have broken off several times. The rings of the last decade and the 3 surplus rings, which have joined the ring connecting the ends of the strap with a paternoster bead that is also missing, are constantly missing. A paternoster bead wreath is also missing.  The age of the piece is difficult to determine, but it is unlikely to date back to before the 16th century, as this division of the rosary hardly occurs earlier. In any case, this prayer cord with its almost exotic appearance is a unicum. - (12) Dr. A. F.

Forrer sends the following communication from Strasbourg i. Eis., November 4, about Roman vessels with colored lead glaze.  The question of whether the Romans were familiar with lead glaze has long been denied, but the number of finds proving the contrary has recently increased to such an extent that there can no longer be any doubt: The Romans were familiar with lead glaze and its use in ceramics, the technique was even generally known and practiced in many places. Such glazed vessels were found both in


Page 426

 Austria, as well as on the Rhine (in the museums of Wiesbaden and Worms) and in France. As far as I know, this has not yet been known for the latter country, but a find at Damery in the department of the Marne shows that glazing was also practiced in Gaul in Roman times. The evidence is a lamp and a small jug that were found there and whose shapes betray the middle Roman imperial period.  The lamp (Fig. 1) is made of light brown, finely polished clay, has a diameter of no less than 14 cm and is decorated with bunches of grapes; a potter's stamp is visible on the base. The base, side walls, handle and the ornamented rim of the lamp now show a well-preserved, albeit occasionally oxidized, green glaze, which in places also thickly covers the relief-like grape ornaments. The glaze is not evenly applied and appears to have rubbed off and flaked off several times.  The central area of the lamp cover also shows a thin layer of glaze, which is light brown in color and apparently of a different consistency than the green glaze. At the rim, the two glaze colors have mixed in some places. The green glaze in particular shows strong iridescence.  The jar (Fig. 2), 12 cm high, has the shape sketched here and a light brown clay similar to that of the lamp. The shape corresponds to some gilded Roman ash jars, but is more delicate and is enhanced in appearance by relief ornaments (bosses, rosettes and lines) pressed into the still soft clay with stamps. What is particularly interesting here, however, are the traces of a thin, yellow-colored glaze that can be detected on the handle, body and neck of the vessel.  Figure 2: We see here that the use of colored glazes has already progressed to such an extent that two Roman vessels show no less than three different glazes, and one of these vessels even shows two glazes applied. - It is striking that these glazed Roman vessels are found almost exclusively in Roman provincial territory. One could almost be tempted to think of "provincial inventors". The rare occurrence of these glazed vessels is also strange. If they had only been found in one place, for example if the Rhenish finds of green-glazed Roman vessels, such as those found in Wiesbaden and Worms, had remained unique, one might think of a local phenomenon that appeared only to disappear again soon after, unnoticed. But the very fact that, despite their great rarity, these vessels already have a large distribution area, that they have not been found only in Germany, only in France or only in Austria, gives food for thought and makes the question a particularly interesting one. - Mr. R. Virchow: The question of the glazing of clay vessels is often discussed in our society and we have never doubted the existence of the same on Roman vessels Figure 1. Figure 2.

 have been found. As regards glazing with multiple colors, I myself have cited examples of this from the museums of Trier, Worms and Dürkheim (Yerh. 1882, p. 491); of the former I said: "I will mention only one particularly surprising occurrence, namely undoubtedly Roman and equally undoubtedly glazed thong ware in green and yellow colors, as we had previously attributed almost exclusively to the Middle Ages." On an earlier occasion (Yerh. 1875, p. 232) I answered a question from Mr. y. Alten to the effect that "an actual glaze on Thongeräthen had hardly become common in northern Germany before the 13th century." Later, Mr. Friedel presented a small bowl excavated on the Silberberg near Wollin, which was characterized "by a clear green-grey glaze" (Verh. 1883, p. 112); he compared the shards found at that time with Scandinavian pottery of the 10th to 12th century. Nevertheless, the introduction of the glaze can be dated very differently depending on the different localities. For a long time, Schliemann was inclined to attribute certain glazed potsherds that he found in Mycenae to an accidental admixture of a later date, until he finally convinced himself that they must be very old. Incidentally, Landerer had already demonstrated a type of lead glaze on black vessels (Schlie mann, Mycenes, trad, par Girardin, Paris 1879. p. 144, 178). - (14) Mr. A.

P., derived in its name from "rdest" knotweed, weed, above the entrance to the coach house in a long since demolished stable building there was a board of pine wood attached to the transom (110 cm long, 24 cm wide, 6 cm thick), which had the attached form and inscription, the latter however mostly in majuscules and and 110 cm.  EVERYTHING THAT IS HIRSE9NE SOT 3V OER FRISTX% ® BEFORE UNSLVKv.

In addition, it can be attributed to the skillful craftsmanship of the object, which is of course made entirely of layers of wood (newer buildings made of bricks or in which a blessing is removed).

 The carpenter then usually applies the year of construction as well as the initials of the owner's (not the owner's) name and patronymic on both sides of the gable in thick black paint. If the same business used to be the responsibility of the carpenter, it would not be surprising if the reason for a large number of gable ornaments were also to be sought and found in the revelation of the carpenter's skill. However, as can be seen, the two-rowed saying of the blessing board reads, in a linguistic incorrectness that was certainly not observed at the time and without punctuation: Everything that is here God bless zv ieder Frist Vor Unglvk v. Schad beware frvh v. spat.  1702 As I was informed by Mr. Fritz Poltrok, son of the former owner, there was another incision on the outside of the same stable with the words: "Renovirt 1735 Wilhelm Birr", which of course came to an end at the same time as the stable. It is possible that the bearer of this name, which I also found on a sign in the town of Lauenburg in 1893, was also the builder of the entire first building.  I must also mention in passing that when I mentioned this name several times, I was always told that I also knew one or more people with the same name; however, they were all carpenters or of a similar profession (fountain makers, etc.). Although this striking fact applies to West Prussia, it would appear that the nature and manner of a trade is or can be or tends to be attached to a certain patronymic, thus testifying to the inheritance of the trade in a family.  It is obvious, however, that only the desire for perpetuation (perhaps a kind of old-fashioned recommendation card!) could have been involved in this incision.  The blessing board, however, still plays its role today, as it was nailed to a beam in today's storage room, as the holes on both sides show. The thickness of the board was therefore shortened. - (15) Mr. A. Treichel discusses the Ehlend stone.  On the site of the owner Breitenreiter in the forest of Roslasiner B Kr. Lauenburg i. P., near the Lauenburg city forest, there is an erratic reddish granite with blasted, shining orthoclase in band form and rather large extension, although several pieces of it have been blasted off several times and even now there are still two boreholes in it for the same purpose. Its height is about 2.40 m and its circumference at average height is 7.56 m, not counting what may have been blasted off. During my visit in 1893, I found three lines chiseled into the surface at intervals. I was told that the stone had been given to an owner named Ehlend in Elen in the town of Lauenburg for carving and that he was working on it, as popular legend has it, in order to complete a coffin from it while he was still alive, even though he was about 80 years old. I took a chipped Han Orthoclas for the collections of the West Prussian Provincial Museum. However, when I visited the owner, I found the matter in a completely different light, as he wanted to form pillar stones from it. The same is over


Page 429

 He is a formidable stone carver and, despite his advanced years, displays remarkable skill in this field. He also knows how to group the different rocks according to their content (limestone), hardness and color. I found there carved impregnation stones with trough-shaped hollows, also mah stones of the kind where the passage of the counterpressure is on the ceiling, s then stone tobacco tiles, one of them in an extremely successful smooth finish and in a pleasing shape with rounded, The ceiling is then topped with stone tobacco tiles, one of which has an extremely successful smooth finish and a pleasing shape with rounded, ear-shaped projections on both sides, and even, which would certainly not have been necessary given the abundance of strong wood there, a stone corner post, into the groove-like hollowed-out longitudinal wall of which the wooden slats, which are otherwise supported by wood in their central position, run. Add to this the old man with rigid facial muscles, almost as if made of stone, and you have to admit that all this behavior, as well as the silent witnesses of his skillful activity, scattered everywhere on and around the house, almost in the middle of the wide forest and obviously on a patch of earth that had only been wrested from him by clearing, had to strike me as quite strange. I felt as if I had been transported back to the doings and goings-on of the Stone Age. - (16) Mr. A. Treichel describes round marks in Mohrungen.  In 1893, on the occasion of a meeting of the Prussian Botanical Society in Mohrungtm in East Prussia, I found round marks on the now Protestant, formerly Catholic church, namely on the two corner pillars of the (east-facing) entrance door, as well as on the adjoining side wall on both sides. They can be found in almost every one of the large bricks, even in those of blackish hard fire. The fact that they are not found in a brick that has probably been completely destroyed by such marks only testifies to their early origin. I counted up to ten of them on one brick. Then they were close together and not deeply buried. But where there were fewer, about four, on one brick, they were up to 3 cm deep. I could also see inscriptions on the left corner pillar, but I couldn't quite read them. They reach up to the height of a man and almost to the height of the church door. I was not able to discover longitudinal grooves. I was told that these round marks owed their origin to possible penitential exercises in former times. - (17) Mrs. Schlemm sent me four photographs she had taken in Switzerland, two of which show the prehistoric stone cist tomb next to the Musee des Beaux Arts, which was found 18 of the pile dwellings near Auvernier.  The other two photographs show an erratic block of stone with 4 crude figures on one side, now erected in Geneva on de des Bastions. This stone was found in the N and is known as Pierre aux fees or Pierr. It is popularly said to be a "druid stone" and people probably think it is a sacrificial stone. The origin and meaning of the sculptures attached to it have not yet been determined. -

 (18) Mr. M. Bartels presents a photograph of the so-called monkey girl Krao, which is now being shown again in the Passage-Panopticum. It is known that during her earlier presence in Germany in 1884, she was claimed to be the representative of a hairy, wild people that had been discovered in the jungles of Laos. A family living in Mandalay had been known from Laos for many years (cf. Zeitschr. f. Ethn. 1873, Y. p.243), which was afflicted with abnormal hair, hypertrichosis universalis, in a similar way to the Krao. All these people were supposed to belong to the above-mentioned wild hair-people, who supposedly represented a transitional link from apes to humans. It was soon proven that the young girl was not Laotian at all, but that she was born in Bangkok to Siamese parents (see Verhandl. 1884, pp. 112 and 113).  The photograph did not turn out well, but it is the best available.  Perhaps it will be possible to persuade the Krao to allow better photographs to be taken of her. - (19) Mr. Franz Boas sends the continuation (cf. p. 265) of his collection of legends of the Indians in Northwest America.  XIX Legends of the Nak'o'mg-yilisala.  1. the K-'ä'nigyilak' saga.  1. k'ä'nigyilak' and NEmö'k'ois (= the one who is alone) were K'ants'ö'ump's (= our father) sons. A long, long time ago he sent them both down to earth, where they were reborn by a woman named Tsatsaquitela'k-a (= the Olach woman). The twins grew up quickly. At that time there were no fish swimming in the rivers and seas and K"'ä'nigyilak' longed to see the waters alive with salmon and other fish. Tsatsaquitela'k-a, however, kept all the fish in her mantle. K''ä'nigyilak' asked her to lend it to him. When he had received it, he boarded the boat with his brother and they first went up the river, then returned and rowed out to sea. As they found no fish anywhere, K'Vnigyilak' dipped a corner of his mother's cloak into the sea, and lo and behold, two salmon jumped out and swam merrily away. They quickly multiplied and soon the river and sea were full of fish. But Tsatsaquitela'lra became angry when she saw that K-'ä'nigyilak' had freed the fish. She left her children and went to the land of the salmon.  2 But K-'ä'nigyilak' and NEmö'k'ois went up the river in search of adventure. When they had traveled for a while, they saw a house. There lived the heron and his wife, the woodpecker, who were still human at the time.  The brothers went ashore and K-'ä'nigyilak' said to the man: "I will teach you to build a salmon weir." He showed him how to do it, and the heron was happy to have such an easy way of obtaining food. As a reward, he took K-'ä'nigyilak' and NEmö'k'ois in as his children.  In the morning he said to them: "I will now go to the salmon pond with my wife and see if there is anything in it. You stay here. I will watch down by the water to see if anyone comes here. If I see one of the wicked people who live near here coming, I will call out. Dan


Page 431

 Hide in the forest so that he doesn't catch you." Then the two old men left. But the wife was greedy and stingy and did not want to give the children anything, so she said to her husband, "If we find fish in the weir, you should shout before we return. The children will then run away and we can eat the salmon alone." And behold, they found a fish in the weir. They took it, went home, and then the man screamed at the top of his lungs. When K*'ä'nigyilak' and Ni'.nio'k'ois heard this, they hurriedly hid in the forest. But the woman cut up the fish, cooked it and they both enjoyed it. When the children came out again in the evening, the man said: "It's a good thing you ran away. When I shouted this morning, I saw two of our enemies coming towards our house. If I call you again tomorrow, just hide quickly." But the woman said nothing and kept eating.  The next morning, the two old men went back down to the river to see if any salmon had been caught. And lo and behold, they found four fish.  They carried them home, and when they were close enough, the man shouted again. Then K-'ä'nigyilak' said to his brother, "Let us see who these wicked people really are. Come, let's hide here, near the house, and not go into the forest." They did as K*'ä'nigyilak' had advised, and then they saw that only the old man and his wife had come, and that they were carrying four heavy salmon into the house. They heard the wife say to her husband, "Now make a fire quickly, we want to eat before the children come back." The man obeyed, and then they cooked the fish and began to eat. Then K-'ä'nigyilak' became angry. He took his bow and shot first the man, then the woman. Then he took their bodies and threw them up in the air, saying, "Now fly away as birds." Then the man was turned into a heron and the woman into a woodpecker.  (3) And K'änigyilak' and NEmö'k ois left the place and wandered forbass.  When they came to Tsä'mö (near Newette Bar), they saw a wonderfully beautiful fish swimming about in the river, its body shining like light. K-'änigyilak' took a stick and struck it. Then the fish turned into a Si'siutl (the fabulous, two-headed snake), which he slew. He pulled it ashore, cut it open and pulled off its skin, from which he made himself a belt. And he took out his eyes, which he carefully guarded.  (4) And the brothers went on their way. Soon they came to Guäne (near Cap Scott). There K-'ä'nigyilak' saw a mighty whale swimming in the sea, which he wanted to kill. He asked. NEmö'lrois to lend him his sling. He placed one of Si'siutl's eyes in the sling as a slingstone, and when the whale resurfaced to breathe, he swung the sling, the stone flew away in a whirl and hit the whale, which immediately died. In this way, K-'ä'nigyilak' killed four whales that drifted ashore in Pä'tsis the next morning. He gave the sling back to NEmö'k'ois, went down to the sea and picked up the whales by their tails. This is how he carried them up to land. Their backs and breathing holes can still be seen there today.  5 K-'ä'nigyilak' now went into the forest, where he fetched a heap of small sticks from which he built two small houses. Then he took some water in his mouth and spat on the houses, which suddenly expanded enormously. And he called one house K-'oä'k-oakyiutelas (= it is so big that the people on the opposite side seem small [??]), the other one


Page 432

 Yuibä'lagyilis (= where the wind blows in on all sides [??]). He gave the latter to his brother. And he said to him: "I want to go now, wander the world and get to know all the people. You stay here. If you are hungry, eat from the whales. That will be enough until I return to you."  6 So they parted. When K-'ä'nigyilak' had wandered for some time, he came to a village and was astonished to see that smoke was not rising from any of the houses. He went into every single house, but saw no one.  Finally, in the last house, he found a man named Nau'etsä and his granddaughter, a little girl, the only inhabitants of the village. He asked: "Where are all your compatriots?" "The monster Ts'e'k'is, which lives in that lake, has killed everyone. As soon as someone went down to fetch water, it came and devoured him. We are the only survivors." He stayed in the house with Nau'etsä and his granddaughter. One day he said to the child: "Go down to the lake and fetch me some water." But the old man strongly opposed this and would not tolerate it. He shouted: "No, she should not and must not go! Ts'e'k'is must not snatch the last of my children away from me, and he will certainly eat her if she goes." But K-'ä nigyilak' tried to calm him down. He gave the bucket to the child, tied the belt made from Si'siutl's skin around her and told her to go. He followed her and saw the Ts'e'k'is appear and devour the poor child. Then K"'ä'nigyilak' grabbed a stick and, beating a beat on a stone, he sang: "Si'siutl! come to life and kill him; wake up and kill him!" No sooner had he sung out than the monster came up from the depths and writhed in agony. It spat out the bones of all the people it had devoured. Then K-'ä'nigyilak' shot it with his arrows. He reassembled the bones and sprinkled them with the water of life. Then they got up and rubbed their eyes as if they had been asleep. They left the place of misfortune and became the ancestors of K-'ä'mö.  7 And K-'ä'nigyilak went forbass. When he had walked for some time, he came to He'likiligyala (= the healer of the sick) [p. 258], who wore a neck-ring of red-colored cedar bast. He lived with his sister Lötlemä'k'a (NötlEmä'k'a?) in the same house. When K-'änigyilak' arrived, they were both dancing.  He'likiligyala carried a stick between his hands folded flat.  When he blew on it, it flew through the house towards his sister, who caught it. When K-'ä'nigyilak' saw this, he was afraid and crept secretly around the house before He'likiligyala had seen him.  ' 8 And he went on and came to Tsetsek'lä'sis (on Hope Island). There lived NömasE'nQilis (= the oldest on earth). He had a son named Tleqyä'ligyila and a daughter named Aikyä'öek'a (= the shining one) [p. 259].  NömasE'nQilis knew that K-'ä'nigyilak' would come and said to his son: "Soon K-'ä'nigyilak1 will come, but be calm, he will fear you.  You go to Qu'spalis (Newette Bar) and wait for him. I will stay here." When K''ä'nigyilak' saw the NömasE'nqilis, he turned him into a large stone, which still lies on the shore today. His hair was transformed into grass and earth, which cover the upper part of the rock. Aikyä'öek-a had a house in Tsetsek'lä'sis, in front of which stood a heraldic pole. Two constantly screaming eagles sat on it. K-'ä'nigyilak' tore it out and threw it into the sea. 9. He went on and came to QütsEqstä'e (the burial place of Newette). There he met Ö'meätl (p. 242). When the latter saw him coming, he stretched out


Page 433

 The man only extended his index finger towards him and pierced K-'ä'nigyilak's head.  Then he stretched out his index finger towards Ö'meätl and pierced his head. Then they both feared each other and separated. 10. And K-'änigyilak' came to Quspalis, where Tleqyä'Iigyila was waiting for him.  He saw that the latter was dancing Tsetsä'ek'a (= the secrets) with his sister Naqnaisilaö'k'oa (= the one who always illuminates the earth). So he was afraid and passed by.  11. and he met Nö'mas (= the old man) [p. 240], the progenitor of the Tlau'itsis (= the irascible). He was the first to make fishing lines from seaweed in order to catch halibut. Therefore, the Tlau'itsis were also the first to use such lines. K"'ä'nigyilak' made friends with him and filled the rivers of his country with salmon.  (12) He went on and met Kue'qagyila (= the murderer) [p. 255], whose house stood on the summit of Mount Qusela. He saw him dancing in the mask of the gray bear Nöntlum. Then he knew that he was strong and mighty.  13 And he went to Kwäkiü'tis (the region of Fort Rupert), where he found Haialikyä'we (p. 238), who lived in TlElä't (Hardy Bay). He had the Sl'siütl as his coat of arms and wore the Hai'alikyamtl mask and an ermine headdress when dancing. They wanted to test their strength on each other. First K-'ä'nigyilak' let the water rise so that it covered the whole house. When it had fallen again, he saw that Haialikyä'we was safe and sound in the house. So he let it rise and fall again.  Haialalikyä'we, however, only snorted and shook himself. The water could not harm him. Then K''ä'nigyi]ak' tried to burn him and his house.  He heaped a large pile of logs in the middle of the house, lit it and threw Haialikyä'we into it. He immediately sank and reappeared not far from the fire. The house did not burn either, because the Sl'siütl protected it.  Then K''ä'nigyilak' saw that he was dealing with a powerful opponent and decided to make friends with him. He filled the river of TlElä't with salmon, took him by the hand and said: "All this land shall be yours.  You are a mighty wizard. Continue to dance your marvelous dance. Your descendants shall inherit your art and your dancing tools."  And they called each other brothers. 14 K'ä'nigyilak' went on and came to Tlalä'ete. There he met a large yogel. When he saw him coming, he took off his bird's clothing and said: "Behold, I am Mä'tagyila" (ancestor of the Maa'mtagyila family of the Kue'tela tribe). Then K'Vnigyilak' called him brother and created salmon for him in the river Ts'E'lqot (near the southern end of Hardy Bay). Later Mä'ta gyila moved to K'oä'tse and built a house there.  15. and K-'ä'nigyilak' visited the mighty K-'e'qtlala and made friends with him. He met Hä'natlenoq (= the archer, ancestor of a lineage of the K-'ö'möyue), who almost shot him with his arrows, TsVnQk'aiö (ancestor of the Walaskwakiutl lineage of the same name), who lived in Tä'ek'otl, and Lä'laqsEnt'aio (ancestor of the Kue'tela family of the same name), as well as Sß'ntlae, the son of the sun (ancestor of the Si'sEntlae family of the Kue'tela).  (16) He went on and came to E'lis (Cormorant Island), where he visited Qutsetsä'lis and iHa'k ame (Mission of Alert Bay).  17 Then he went over to QulkH (at the mouth of the Nimkish River).  There lived Guanä'lalis (see Yerhandl. 1892, p. 388), who had four beautiful daughters.  Verhandl. der Berl. Aiithropol. Society 1893. 28


Page 434

 When K-'ä'nigyilak' arrived, the girls were swimming in the river. Then K-'ä'nigyilak' turned into an old man. When the girls saw him, they called out: "0, stay here and wait until we come out of the water, then you shall wash our backs." He obeyed. When the eldest of the sisters got out of the water, he washed her back from top to bottom and then stuck his index finger into her vagina. "Hoo!" she screamed, "what are you doing!"  She then went to her sisters and said: "Let Book wash her back too, you should see how nicely the old man does it!" The second and third did so, and K-'ä'nigyilak' did the same with them. But the youngest refused and would not let the old man touch her. Then K-'ä'nigyilak' took on his true form. When the girls saw this, the youngest called out, "See, what did I tell you! If only you hadn't let the old man wash you." But he took the youngest as his wife.  The older sisters went into the house to their father and said, "Father! Your youngest daughter has had a husband! Cleanse your house to receive him." Then Guanä'lalis cleaned his whole house and invited K'Vni gyilak' to come in. He assigned him a chamber where he slept with his young wife*1. The older sisters, however, slept in their chambers. The next morning, all four women found that they were pregnant. K-'ä'nigyilak's wife gave birth to a boy who grew up quickly.  Guanä'lalis, however, was angry with his son-in-law because he had seduced all his daughters and decided to kill him. One day he said to him: "Come, let's go and split planks to make a new house. I have chosen a cedar tree, but I can't cut it down by myself." They took their hammers and wedges and went into the forest. They joined forces to fell the mighty cedar tree and when they had finished, they began to split the tree. They had already driven their wedges deep into it and spread the split half of the tree wide apart when Guanä'lalis deliberately drove his hammer, which fell deep into the gaping crevice. "0," he shouted, "I've lost my hammer! Won't you get it back for me?" K'ä'nigyilak' willingly crawled into the gap. Then Guanä'lalis knocked the supporting wedges out of the tree, which immediately collapsed with great force. But the old man called out: "So it serves you right, K-'ä'nigyilak'! This is the reward for seducing my daughters!" But no sooner had he spoken than he heard someone behind him say: "Here, Guanä'lalis, is your hammer." Startled, he turned around and saw K-'ä'nigyilak' standing unharmed behind him. But he quickly composed himself and said: "0, friend, I am so sad; the wedges flew out of the tree and I thought for sure you were slain. My heart is glad that you escaped unhurt." K-'ä'nigyilak' did not answer at all, and they both returned home. On the way, K-'ä'nigyilak' picked two berries and when they arrived home, he threw each one into a bowl. His wife asked him, "Where did you find the berries?" He replied: "Where we felled the cedar tree." He gave one bowl to his father-in-law and the other to his wife, and lo and behold, both were full of berries. The ones he gave to Guanä'lalis were so enchanted that a tree grew out of his body after he had eaten them. Later, however, he restored him to health.  After he had lived there for some time, he became sad and depressed. He lay down and stayed in bed for four days. Guanä'lalis tried to cheer him up, but he would not listen. His wife asked him to get up and asked him if he was ill. At last he said: "I am not


Page 435

 sick, but my heart longs for my brother. Stay here, my wife, I will return to you."  18 After long wanderings, K-'ä'nigyilak' returned to Guä'ne, where he had once left his brother. He saw no one outside. He entered the house and saw him lying in bed. He called him, but NEmö'k'ois heard him. He wanted to shake him and saw that he had been dead for a long time. Nu bleached bones lay under the blankets. Then K-'ä'nigyilak sprinkled the water of life on him and the dead man stood up, rubbed his eyes and said: "0, how long have I been asleep!" K-ä'nigyilak' replied: "You did not sleep! You were dead and I have awakened you again. 19 Then he carved four men out of cedar wood and called them T'öqtoua' Kapk-ap'ä'lis, Kn'etok'ä'lis and Bebekumlisi'la. After two days they came to life.  20. in the far west lived Hä'nitsum, who had a beautiful daughter named AiHtsumä'letlilok. She wished to have K-'ä'nigyilak' as her wife. He boarded his boat KökvVmalis. After long wanderings, he arrived at Hä'nitsum's home and found his house. There he married AiHtsumä'letlilok (= with many earrings made of haliotis shells) and returned with her to Guä'ne. After some time she gave birth to a boy. He was given the name Hä'neus and became a powerful chieftain.  21 K-'ä'nigyilak' wandered on. On his wanderings he met Mä'le lek'ala, who was ill all over. K-'ä'nigyilak' ran his hand over his body and healed him. Then he gave him a pole and a house and filled the Pluss Wekyau'ayaas with salmon for him.  22 And K-'ä'nigyilak' went on his way. At last he came to Comox. When he saw a boat approaching there, he turned back into an old man and awaited the arrival of the strangers. They spotted him and rowed ashore. The chief asked: "Who are you and where do you come from?" "0," said K-'ä'nigyilak', "I am a poor slave who has run away from his cruel master." "So come with me to my house, I will be your master from now on." K-'ä'nigyilak' got into the boat, they sailed home and he became the chief's slave. Throughout the winter he stayed in the house with the other slaves, but when it became warm again and the chief had invited all the neighboring tribes to a great feast, he sent his slaves and many men from his tribe to fetch wood. The old slave that K*'ä'nigyilak' had turned into was too weak to help cut down trees and carry wood. So the chief had him draw the water from the boat. He was so weak that five men had to pick him up and carry him into the boat.  Then they rowed away. When they came to the mouth of a river, they landed, and the twenty men who made up the company went into the forest to cut wood, while the old slave stayed by the boat to guard it.  When they were all out of sight, K-'änigyilak' went to the shore, shook himself, stretched his limbs and thus regained his true form.  With a heave, he pulled the boat ashore. It was a clear day and the sun was shining hotly down on the earth. To protect the boat from the harmful effects of the sun, he threw a tree trunk into the water so that it was splashed all over with water and called in the branches of a tree to shade it. These obeyed his command and shielded the boat from the scorching rays. Then he lay down to sleep.  28*


Page 436

 After a while, one of the young men came back to see if the old slave was guarding the boat properly. When he saw the strong man in the old man's place and found the boat pulled ashore, he was astonished and realized that K''ä'nigyilak had approached them in such a pitiful form.  Soon the other men arrived, having felled a tree, which they now laboriously carried on their shoulders to the boat. They often had to rest, as the trunk weighed heavily on their shoulders. When K"'ä'nigyilak' saw them, he called out: "Have you finally finished? I thought you would never come back." He moved his hand and the branches of the shady tree sprang back into their original position and he pushed the boat back into the river. Then all those who had teased and mocked him earlier were afraid of his weakness. He went into the forest and met the people who had just laid the log down to rest. He said, "Let me see the trunk before you pick it up again," and then called to it, "Straighten up and follow me." And lo and behold, the tree did as he told it. When K-'ä'nigyilak and the tree came to the shore, he ordered it to break into logs and pile itself into the boat. When the twenty men then saw the tree fall with a crash and saw how it broke into a thousand logs, which then piled up by themselves, they were very frightened.  The boat was now heavily loaded and they returned home. When the boat had reached the shore, K-'ä'nigyilak ordered the wood to go ashore and pile up in the chief's house. It obeyed him and soon the logs were piled up to the roof. And he continued: "You shall avenge me for all the mistreatment I have suffered here. Burn the house and all its inhabitants!"  When the chief gave the plague and everyone was sitting at the feast, the wood began to burn of its own accord. Now the chief begged him: "0, K-'ä'nigyilak', spare us. Don't let the fire consume my house and I will give you my daughter as a wife." At this K-'ä'nigyilak's heart was glad, he moved his hand downwards and behold, the fire was extinguished. For four days he stayed with his wife, then he returned to Guä'ne.  (23) And K-'ä'nigyilak' wandered on. Once he met an old man named Tle'qekyötl who was sharpening two shells on a whetstone. K-'ä'ni gyilak' approached him and asked him what he was doing. He turned around gruffly and replied: "Hm! If K-'ä'nigyilak' comes here, I want to hit him on the head with it and kill him." He did not recognize him. Then K-'ä'nigyilak' said: "0, that's right! Let me see your shells for once!" Tlä'qekyötl first gave him one, and when K-'änigyilak' asked for it, the other shell as well. Then he hit him in the head with one on the right and the other on the left, smeared his backside with dirt and shouted: "Now become a deer and run into the forest." And so it happened. The shells were turned into antlers and the stags are still black at the back today.  24 K-'ä nigyilak' went on and met a man who was busy painting a stick carefully with black rings. He stepped next to him and asked, "What are you doing?" The man turned around and said, "If K-'ä'nigyilak' comes here, I will kill him with this stick." He did not recognize him either. K'a'nigyilak' replied: "Well, I don't know the man, but it will certainly serve him right. Let me see your stick for once!" The man gave it to him, then K-'ä'nigyilak' let him stand up,


Page 437

 and suddenly he thrust the stick into his backside. Then he painted his mouth and back black and said: "From now on be a raccoon and live on the mountains."  25 K-'ä'nigyilak' continued his wanderings and came to Ts'ä'lo (Sey mour Narrows). There he saw a man named K'oä'k'oa standing with his salmon harpoon and ashes. K-'ä'nigyilak' turned back before the man had seen him and thought about how he could steal the harpoon from him. At last he had devised a means of achieving this goal. He created a man whom he ordered to stand on a rock and watch what he would do. He transformed himself into a salmon and asked him: "Do I look just like a salmon?" "No," he replied, "try again." And K-'ä'nigyilak' changed again and had now completely taken on the form of a salmon swimming up the river in spring. He now swam to Ts'ä'lo, where K'oä'k'oa stood and held the harpoon in readiness to stab the first salmon that came near him. K-'ä'nigyilak' swam to him and played quietly in the water very close to him. K'oä'k'oa was delighted, threw the harpoon into his side and wanted to pull him ashore. But the salmon braced itself against a stone and when the man pulled in the harpoon line with all his strength, the tip broke off and the salmon swam away with it. Thus K-'ä'nigyilak' had achieved his intention.  But K'oä'k'oa was sad, went home and lay down. Meanwhile, K'ä'nigvilak' took on his true form again. He happily looked at the harpoon tip and hung it on his ear as an ornament. Then he got back into his boat1 Kök'ö'malis, made himself a helmsman and went to the place where K'oä'k'oa's house stood. As they approached, K'oä'k'oa's son, who was playing in front of the house, saw the boat and drew his father's attention to it, who told him to invite the new arrivals. The boy went down to the beach and called out: "Our chief invites you to come to his house, he wants to give you a feast." K-'ä'nigyilak' accepted the invitation; he landed and went into the house. There K'oä'k'oa showed him a place by the fire, and K'ä'ni gyilak' sat down. He was vain of his ear ornaments and turned his head back and forth so that he could be seen. When K'oä'k'oa saw the harpoons pointing in the stranger's ears, he called out, "Where did you get your ear ornaments?" "O," replied K-'ä'nigyilak', "I've been wearing them for a long, long time." But K'oä'k'oa shook his head and said hesitantly: "I don't know, I've lost something that looks just like your ear ornaments." He was convinced that he had stolen it from him and became very angry. He took a bone, split it into thin needles and stuck them into a salmon, which he put in front of K-'ä'nigyilak'. When he started to eat, the sharp splinters got stuck in his throat. He tried to spit them out, but was unable to do so; they only lodged themselves more firmly in his gullet and blood gushed out of his mouth. Then he said, "Why are you deceiving me like this?  You promised to give me a good meal and now you are making me ill!  If you free me from the bone splinters, I will also give you my ear ornaments." The crane was delighted. He shook K''änigyilak' and the bones fell out of his neck. K''änigyilak' then took the harpoon tips out of his ears and pressed them to K'oä'k'oa's nose: "So," he shouted, "they shall sit there forever," and he grabbed him and threw him into the air. Then he flew away as a crane. He turned his wife into a woodpecker.


Page 438

 26 And he walked on. After a while he came across a man and a woman sitting opposite each other, holding their arms up and nodding their heads. He wanted to see what they were doing, went closer and saw that their genitals were sitting on their foreheads and that they were cohabiting.  Then he said, "I must fix you up," and he made them look like other people. "This," he said, "is how you shall produce children in future."  27 As he went on, he heard the noise of many people. At first he saw no one, but when he came to a point of land, he discovered a man who was rolling about on the ground, then jumping into the water, and then coming back to the shore. His body was covered all over with mouths, all laughing and shouting at the same time. K-'ä'nigyilak' asked: "What are you doing there?"  But the other did not answer, but kept on laughing and shouting so that K-'ä'nigyilak' had to cover his ears. At last it became too much for him and he stroked the man's whole body with his hand. Then all the countless mouths disappeared and he became a real man. K-'ä'nigyilak1 gave him the name Yä'k-'EntEmaks. 28 He went on and came to a place. There he found a house whose door stood open, and inside he saw four blind girls sitting around a fire in which they were heating a stone to boil four roots lying in a wooden pot. As he came closer, the eldest said: "I smell K-'ä'ni gyilak', he can't be far from us." But he crept secretly into the house and took the four roots away unnoticed. When the girls wanted to throw the glowing stone into the water, they found that their roots were gone and they said to each other, "Where have our roots gone?" Then K'ä'ni gyilak' came to them and said, "How is it that you are all blind? I will heal you," and he took each of them by the hand and led them outside.  He took some resin in his mouth, chewed it and then spat on their eyes. This gave them sight. And he took the girls by the legs and threw them into the air. Then they were turned into ducks.  29 And K''ä'nigyilak' went on his way. After some time he came across a boat. A man and a woman were sitting in it, rowing with all their might. However, they were not holding the oars in their hands, but the man had his arms crossed over his back, the woman over her chest, and they had the oars tucked under their arms. Then K-'ä'nigyilak' instructed them and showed them how to row.  30 On his further wanderings he came to Tsaue'te. There he met a young man named Ts'ä'tsö (a bird), who had a small, pretty lance. K-'ä'nigyilak' made a bet with him as to who could hit a target best with the lance and throw it the furthest. The prize was Tsatsaquitelä'k-a's cloak, his mother's, in which the salmon were hidden. Ts'ä'tsö won the bet and, full of joy, he danced around in K-'ä'nigyilak's coat and sang: "Mother, now you don't have to look for "Mücheln" anymore.  From now on we will always have plenty of fish." Sr dipped a corner of the cloak into the water and countless fish of all kinds jumped out of it.  Then K-'ä'nigyilak' said: "From now on there will always be plenty of fish here." Thus was born the fish wealth of Tsaue'te.  31 K-'ä'nigyilak's foot can still be seen imprinted in the stone in Guä'ne today. It is two spans long and one span wide. With one step he could step from there to the island of He'tlas. His eyes are also petrified there. They look like the eyes of a salmon. If you put dirt in


Page 439

 If you throw something into these eyes, it becomes stormy and you must therefore be careful not to touch them. If you throw something into the right eye, an east wind is created, if into the left, a west wind. Furthermore, there is a large hole in Guä'ne into which K-'ä'nigyilak1 once threw many people. That is why it still spews blood today. Many people did not believe that this hole existed. To convince himself, a man once threw a cradle into it, into which he had carved many faces to recognize it. After some time it was found again in Awl'ky'enoq.  2 Le'laqa.  Two eagles and their young flew down from the sky to Qü'mqate (Cap Scott). There they took off their feathers and became human beings. The father was called Nä'laqötau, the mother Ank-ä'layukoa, the son Le'laqa. They built themselves a house in Qü'mqate and lived there. One day, Le'laqa went out in his boat to catch seals and saw some lying on a cliff. He carefully rowed closer and hit one with a safe throw of the harpoon. The seal immediately jumped into the water and pulled the boat far out to sea. Then it turned into a huge octopus, which pulled the boat into the depths and killed Le'laqa. But he came back to life, resurfaced and flew up to the sky as an eagle.  As he did not return, his parents mourned him, for they believed he was dead. They killed two slaves and smeared the pillars of the house with their blood. They tied two others in front of the house. Suddenly they saw an eagle soaring down from the sun towards their house, and they recognized their son. He carried a small box in his talons, which he shook. They heard all sorts of objects rattling inside, and a ring of red-colored cedar bast hung around his neck. Then he turned back into a human being, and his parents' hearts were glad. They lit a big fire and he began to dance. From the box he took out many flutes with which he imitated the voices of eagles; and he wore the large double mask Naqnakyak'umtl (the inner mask represented a man, the outer mask an eagle). After the dance he entertained all the people. He had a large bowl which represented an octopus. This always filled itself with fish oil without anyone pouring anything into it. Le'laqa had a son, who was given the name Kak'ä'lis. He was the progenitor of the Nee'nsna family (= dirty teeth).  3. nemök'otsä'lis.  One morning, as Nemök-otsä'lis was sitting in front of his house, he saw a beautiful white diver swimming around near the coast. Then he said to K-'e'qtlala, Ma'qmalakis and Woqsemä'qala: "Shoot that bird!" K''e'qtlala grabbed his bow, shot and hit it straight in the back. Then he called his brothers and told them to get into the boat with him to pursue the bird, which swam away in a hurry. As they came closer, he shot a second arrow at it and hit it again in the back. As the third arrow did not kill it either, Ma'qmalakis advised his brother to tie a line to the arrow in order to pull it towards the boat. K"'e'qtlala followed the advice, he hit the bird and now it pulled the boat away with it. When they saw the land disappearing into the distance, Ma'qmalakis said to his brother: "You'd better cut the line, we can't catch the bird." K-'e'qtlala tried,


Page 440

 They tried to do so, but the line only fell a little lower and immediately got stuck to the boat again. They tried to cut the line four times, but were unable to get away from the bird.  They had long since lost sight of their home. They now saw a dark stripe appearing in the distance. At first they thought it was land, but soon they saw dense masses of black rock floating on the water like charcoal. They thought the boat could not penetrate the crowded masses, but lo and behold, they opened and closed again after the yogel had pulled them through. Then they came to a place where driftwood covered the sea in dense masses. A road also opened up through this. Now they saw themselves close to a flat coast. They were already looking forward to reaching land, but soon found that it was only pine needles.  Then they reached land where many seals were sunbathing. Woqse mä'qala, who was at the helm, jumped ashore, and lo and behold, it immediately disappeared and he sank into the depths. At last they reached the shore. Here the diver turned into a man and led the two brothers to Kunkunquli'kya's house. He said to him: "I have brought these brothers here to you so that you may give one of them your daughter in marriage." And Kunkunquli'kya gave K-'e'qtlala his daughter Kökökua'k's in marriage.  When some time had passed, K"'e'qtlala longed to return to his father.  He said to his wife: "Oh, I think my father is dead. I want to return to my home." The woman asked her father to go with K"'e'qtlala to his home, and he allowed her to do so. He ordered the wind to carry his daughter and brothers back. When they had traveled for a while, they came to the home of the gray bear, a powerful chief.  He invited them to come to his house and treated them to salmon. The woman, however, carried a basket containing a piece of whale meat which Kun kunquli'kya had given her. Before they left the bear, she put a piece of salmon in the basket. They traveled on, following the course of the sun, and came to the house of K 'e'Hustäel, the deer. He gave them fat to eat, and she put a piece of it in her basket. They traveled on and came to the house of Tle'selagyila the Mink. He gave them mussels to eat, of which Kökökua'k put one in her basket. Then they came to the house of the otter, Amaqama'kitla'seli (= the one sitting on top of the house[??]).  They went inside and saw many otters in the house. The chief invited them to sit by the fire and then showed them his trap, which he had had built by his slaves. He asked K-'e'qtlala to crawl in to try it out. But he was afraid. Then his wife whispered to him: "Just go in; I'll blow on the trap and it won't harm you." K'Y/qtlala went into the trap. As his wife blew on it with her cupped hand, she could not hit it. But no sooner had he jumped out again, and no sooner had his wife stopped blowing, than she struck with great force. K-'e'qtlala now called his brother and his wife to set the trap again and then they let the otter go in.  As soon as he was inside, the trap slammed shut and killed him. They took his skin and put it in the basket.  They traveled on and finally came to a lake where the monster Ts'e'k'is (see p. 432) lived. The brothers did not know how to get past, for the monster was sitting by the path and its mouth was constantly opening and closing. Kökökua'k's got past happily, for she could not see the


Page 441

 The monster could not harm her. Then she called out to the brothers: "As soon as I shout, run forward quickly, because then Ts'e'k-is can't harm you." Just as he had opened his mouth wide, she called out and he was unable to close it again. So the brothers happily got through 'his wide-open mouth.  At last they arrived at their destination in Guä'ne. There the thunderbird had built a house for his daughter, with many eagles sitting on the roof to guard it. At night, the wife said to her husband: "You must not sleep now, for my father is coming to bring you whale meat." In the morning, when the man came to the door of the house, he saw a large whale lying there, which the thunderbird had brought overnight. He became a great chief and from then on his slaves worked for him while he did nothing. He invited all his neighbors, his wife took the whale meat, the salmon, the deer fat and the mussels from the basket, and there were so many of them that he could feed them all. His slaves scooped out the blubber from the whale and filled the thran into boxes. K-'e'qtlala threw one of them into the fire so that it flared up brightly. He poured ten of them into the house so that the people swam in them.  (4) Ya'qstatl. The inhabitants of Qöyä'les and Gyyig'e'tlßm (near Dean Inlet) were bitter enemies. The former once attacked the village of Gyigy'e'tlEm near Kimskuitq and killed all the inhabitants with the exception of Tleö'leqmut and his three sons. The eldest of these was called Ya'qstatl. The father wanted to make his sons strong so that they could resist their enemies and half dragged them behind his boat, around an island, so that their backs were mauled by the sharp shells. None of them could stand it, only Ya'qstatl passed the test and Tleö'leqmut took him back into the boat after dragging him around the island. They then traveled to Qöyä'les to take revenge on their enemies. In Ta'tsolis, however, a wolf came into their camp while they were sleeping, threw Ya'qstatl on his back and ran off with him. He lay him down to feel whether he was still breathing. When he was sure he was, he threw him back on his back and ran on.  At last he reached the land of the wolves. He threw Ya'qstatl down in front of the chief's door, took on the form of a man and whistled. Then all the people came out of their houses to see what he had brought. But they took Ya'qstatl for a sea otter, seized him by the arms and legs and carried him into the house, where they threw him on a bench. They began to cut him open lengthwise, but when they had reached his belly, Ya'qstatl stood up and said, "Will you help me take revenge on the men of Qöyä'les?" They promised him their help and asked: "What do you want from us? Do you want this wedge? With it you can build boats to reach them." Ya'qstatl answered nothing, but only thought that he did not want the wedge. Witlak ä'latit, the chief of the wolves, guessed his thoughts. He then asked: "Do you want this spear, you can kill four boats full of sea dogs with it." Ya'qstatl thought again that he did not want the spear and Witlak'ä'latit heard his thoughts. Then the wolves offered him the Water of Life and the Deathbringer Halai'ü. He thought, "Yes, I would like to have those." The chief gave him both and then ordered the wolves to devour Ya'qstatl. He was torn apart in an instant. The wolves spat out the devoured


Page 442

 Witlak-ä'latit sprinkled it with the water of life.  Then Ya'qstatl stood up healthy and whole again and had become very strong.  The wolves all brought him home and he stood on the back of the largest of them. He now went on together with his father and his brothers to kill the people of Qöyä'les. On the way he tried the Halai'ü. He moved it towards a forest and it immediately caught fire.  They drove on. When they were close to Qöyä'les, they saw the people approaching in many boats and Tleö'leqmut now said to Ya'qstatl: "Aim your halai'ü at them, but don't kill them straight away, just scorch their hair."  Ya'qstatl did as he was told. He moved the halai'ü against them while his father and brothers sang and beat time. Then their enemies jumped into the water in terror; their boats were burnt and they were turned into stones.  Ya'qstatl now wanted to fight with the Kwä'kiutl. When he arrived at Qumta'spe, the Halai'ü wanted to destroy the houses of this village by force, whose inhabitants were Ya'qstatl's friends. So he hurled it onto Hope Island and there have been many wolves there ever since. 5. Kuni'Qua (KunkunQuli'kya).  Once Kuni'Qua and the seagull played hoops to see who could catch the best. The seagull's hoop was mist, but Kuni'Qua's was fire; therefore, he could never catch the seagull's hoop, while it hit his every time. After being defeated by the seagull four times, he was so ashamed that he flew away and hid in the forest. Once K'Vtoq (a bird) went into the forest and met Kuni'Qua there. When he looked at him with his fire-spraying eyes, his eyes turned red.  Kuni'Qua wanted to have the red-eyed Tlä'tsem as his wife. He sat down on a tree near her house and thought: "Oh, if only Tlä'tsem would go and do her needful deeds." No sooner had he thought it than she came out of the house.  He immediately threw himself down on her and carried her away to his house.  But she called out: "0, save me! Save me!" Immediately a large meeting was called in the village to discuss what to do. On the advice of the quail, they decided to kidnap Tlä'tsem again if she picked berries.  Tle'selagyila (the mink) was sent ahead to inform the woman that all her friends were hiding in the forest to kidnap her. He met her in the forest gathering berries, and out of joy she forgot to fill her basket and bring berries to her husband. He sent her out again the next day to look for berries, and the animals kidnapped her.  Kuni'Qua was now very sad. He flew after his wife, sat down in a tree near the house and thought: "0, if only Tlä'tsem would go out to fetch water." She immediately took a bucket and went to the water. Then she grabbed Kuni'Qua and flew away with her. Again her friends advised her what to do, and on the quail's advice they turned into trout and swam around in front of Kuni'Qua's house. He immediately caught one of the trout, namely Tlä'tsem's husband, who then managed to bring his wife back.  Kuni'Qua flew after her again, sat down in a tree near the house and thought: "0, if only Tlä'tsem would come out of the house to look for berries."  No sooner had he thought it than she came and he carried her off for the third time. Tlä'tsem's husband was saddened. He lay down in bed and stayed there for four days.  Then he got up, called all the animals together and had them carve a whale


Page 443

 (and so on, see p. 450). The four children of the thunderbird are called here: Mae'mus k-umnek'o'laps, Mosk'umnek'o'laps, Yutlusumnek'o'laps, Matsemnek'olaps and he himself, when he tries to lift the whale, is called Nmsk'umnelcolaps.  Every time a bird grabs the whale, the mouse gnaws its foot in two, the raccoon urinates in its eyes, the bear breaks its wings and the deer Bekue'mas kills it. 6. Nä'k'oaye and Hi'qulatlit.  Once the men of Tlö'puqsEm went out to catch halibut. When they were near Yü'tle, a violent storm arose and all the boats, with the exception of two, overturned. In these were Nä'k'oaye and Hi'qulatlit.  They saw four bird feathers floating on the water, and while the sea was wildly agitated everywhere, for a distance of five fathoms behind the boats the water was as smooth as if there had been no wind. The feathers always swam ahead of them and brought them happily to Cap Scott. Nä'k'oaye's house was on Yü'tle, and he returned there when the weather became good again. Then a raven flew down from the sun and settled on Nä'k-oaye's head.  Once Hi'qulatlit invited all the people to dinner. In truth, however, he had nothing to eat. He just wanted to see Nä'k'oaye dance. All the guests now sat along the steps that ran around the house and beat the beat while Nä'k'oaye danced. A big fire was burning in the middle of the house and Nä'k oaye danced around it. Suddenly his mouth became full of the oil that the raven had given him and he poured it into the fire, causing it to flare up brightly. But he found that it was rancid. So he told the people to beat the beat again and continued dancing. Now he had fresh oil in his mouth. He first poured it into the fire and then filled a large box. Then he said: "Go to the beach tomorrow and see if there isn't a dead whale lying there." They went down and found the whale. The raven had given it to them.  Now Nä'k-oaye asked Hi'qulatlit to dance. He had a bowl full of sea water given to him, put some feathers on it and placed it in his room. That day it stormed and rained so that no one could go out to fish and hunt. So Hi'qulatlit told everyone to go to sleep and when they woke up, the weather was beautiful. He sent them all out to catch halibut, and in no time all the boats were filled to the brim. They brought the fish to shore and went out again to catch more. And in no time at all they had filled their boats again.  Then they found another whale that Nä'k'oaye had killed for them. They cooked the blubber and now had a plentiful supply of fish and thran. The following day, Hi'qulatlit let the weather turn bad again, but they no longer cared, for they now had plenty of food.  Nä'koaye now returned to Yu'tie. After two moons, a chieftain invited him to Qumta'spe. He also danced there and spit fat into the fire.  Before he returned to Yü'tle, he promised that there would be a whale on the beach the following morning. The inhabitants of Qumta'spe looked for the whale the next morning and, not finding it, sailed along the coast. At Cap Scott they met Nä'k'oaye. When they accused him of deceiving them, he told them to go with him to Yü'tle and said: "We will certainly find the whale there. But if it is not there, you shall tie a rope around my neck and kill me." They went to the island of Yü'tle, and in


Page 444

 In fact, they found the whale there, which they dismembered. The men of Qumtaspe left the Thran and returned to their home.  XX Legends of the Awi'ky'enoq.  1. the legend of the ravens.  1. once R'ants'ö'ump (= our father; the deity) sent Kya'lk'F.mkyasö down to earth. He came to the mountain K-'oä'mu and descended into the valley of the river, which was rich in salmon. He sent four women into the forest to fetch cedar bark and taught the people to make nets. When the net was ready, he got into a boat with the people and they began to catch salmon. But at that time there was no sun; only the moon shone in the sky.  The raven He'meskyas (= the true chief) or Kuekuaqä'oe (= the main inventor) knew that the chief Mß'nis had the sun in his possession and decided to steal it. He turned himself into a pine needle and fell into the well from which ME'nis' eldest daughter, named Latäk'ai'yuk'oa, used to fetch water every day. She drew water and the raven slipped into her bucket as a needle; but when she drank, she blew the needle aside. As this trick had failed, the raven turned into shiny berries and the girl saw them reflected in the water. She wanted to eat them; she picked them and ate them. After four days she gave birth to a son, He'meskyas. He grew up quickly and was able to speak on the very first day. He played on the floor of the house and soon began to scream and shout and would not be calmed. His grandfather asked him: "What do you want?" "Make me a salmon weir, I want salmon." The grandfather granted the boy's wish, but he screamed and cried and wanted a bow and arrows. The grandfather fulfilled this wish too and made him a bow and four arrows. The boy calmed down. On the second day he was able to walk and ran down to the water.  On the third day he began to cry again and did not calm down until his grandfather had made him an oar as he wished. He went down to the water with it, but soon came back screaming and wanted to sail on the water. Then his mother asked Mii'nis to build him a boat. The grandfather fulfilled her request and made a boat out of sea lion skin. He'meskyas was delighted, boarded the boat and played with it on the water. But he soon came back and shouted: "I want to play with that little box there."  It was hanging from a beam in the roof of the house and the grandfather kept the daylight in it. Then his mother scolded him and said, "You bad boy, you're not like other children; you want everything. You won't get this box." The boy screamed even more and couldn't calm down. Finally, the grandfather allowed his daughter to lower the box a little so that the grandson could see it. But the grandson was not yet satisfied and finally got permission to play with the box. He took it into the boat and drove it around on the water. But he soon returned home. The next day he cried again until he had the box. He put it in the bosom of the boat and took it far out to sea. There he opened it a little. When the mother, who had been watching him, saw this, she called out to Mn'nis: "0, see what wickedness he is up to." When he opened the box even more, the sun came out and illuminated the earth. (Narrated by a young woman.)


Page 445

 la. Once it was constantly dark; the sun did not show itself and the people, who did not know the cause, began to be afraid. They asked Kue'kuaqä'oe for advice and he told them that the chief Nä'lak'amälis was holding the sun captive. So the people asked him to go and free them. Kuekuaqä'oe set off with his sister Ai'Hts'umk'a (see p. 446) and reached Nä'lak'amälis' house. He told his sister to hide and turned into a berry. He wanted to be swallowed by Nä'lak'amälis' daughter, who was called Nä'la-itl (= daylight in the house), but she did not notice him. Then he turned into a pine needle and let himself fall into the water. (The previous story then follows. Ai'Hts'umk cuts the rope with which the boat is tied to the land. Both escape and Kuekuaqä'oe then breaks the crate). [In the beginning there were no springs and streams, but the water flowed inaccessibly under the roots of the trees. But an old man had a bucket full of clear water, and the raven flew to steal it. He tucked a piece of cedar bast under his wing and asked the old man for a drink of water. The old man allowed him to drink, but said: "Don't drink too much, I only have a little water myself." The raven drank. When the old man called out to him to stop, he secretly wiped his tongue with cedar bast and said, "Look, my tongue is still quite dry; I haven't had any." Then the old man allowed him to drink more. Four times he deceived him in this way, then the bucket was completely empty and the raven flew away. But he let drops fall everywhere, and from these the lakes and rivers arose. (Told by a young woman.) 3. Kuekuaqä'oe came to Nö'qunts (where he is also said to have reached the earth first when he came down from heaven). At that time there were no salmon in the lake and rivers, and Kuekuaqä'oe wished to have them. He went to the forest spirit Mä'kyagyü, who was good at carving and carpentry, and asked him for salmon. He then carved four fish (Quitlä'la) out of cedar wood for him. Kuekuaqä'oe threw them into the river and Mä'kyagyü made them swim upstream. Kuekuaqä'oe then caught them in a fish trap.  Since Mäkyagyü had carved them from cedar wood, their fur and bones were very hard and Kuekuaqä'oe was not satisfied.  (4) So he went to the graves and asked the dead: "Are there no twins buried here?" Then he heard a voice from a grave saying, "I used to be a salmon." He opened the grave and found the body of a woman inside. He washed it with the water of life, and the woman got up and rubbed her eyes as if she had been asleep. Kuekuaqä'oe led her home. He said to her: "There are no salmon here. Can't you get them here?" So the woman had a mat and seagull feathers given to her and swam around in the river. Everywhere she touched the water there were salmon. The woman was given the name Ömagyl'ek'a (- the main salmon woman). Kuekuaqä'oe now caught many salmon in his nets and placed them on the drying frames in the house. He then carried firewood into the house and piled it up under the salmon to make a good fire. As he did so, he bumped into the drying scaffolding and the salmon got caught in his hair. He got angry, threw the wood down and shouted: "Why do you always tug at my 1) The Kwakiutl and Awiky'enoq believe that twins were salmon before birth and that they can become salmon again.


Page 446

 Hair?" Omagyl'ek'a asked: "What are you saying?" Kuekuaqä'oe said: "0, nothing of importance;" but she knew at once that he had scolded the salmon, and immediately became a withered corpse again.  5 Then Kuekuaqä'oe was sad, for with Omagyl'ek'a all the salmon had disappeared. He went into the forest early in the morning, pulled cedar bast from the tree and returned home. He had four sisters: Gy'ä'nauek'a, AiHts'umk'a (= the shining or Haliotis woman), Yä'lameHume'k'a and Ru'skus (= the blue jay), and a brother Na'noak'aoe (= the ore wise man). He had his sisters make mats to serve as a base for salmon and made a net for himself. When everything was ready, he put the mats and net in the boat and went out into the open sea with Aints'umk'a, further and further to the "west. Their boat had the ability to reach any place, no matter how far it was, in a day. After traveling for a day, they saw a black coast and found that they had reached the land of the salmon. The chief Mä'isila (= where there are many salmon) invited them to come to his house.  Before they accepted the invitation, Kuekuaqä'oe said to his sister: "After a little while, walk along the beach and act as if you wanted to look at the boats. Then drill holes in all the boats." The sister carried out this instruction. Mä'isila then let his four daughters swim in the sea, and after a short time they came back, each with a salmon in her hand, which had been standing as they swam. Mä'isila's wife cooked them and the chief served them to his guests, but ordered them to eat all the fish and not to throw anything into the fire. Suddenly the nose of one of the girls began to bleed, and they knew immediately that Kuekuaqä'oe had hidden a bone. They found the salmon's nose bone on the roof of Kuekua qä'oe's mouth and took it away. The girl's nose immediately stopped bleeding. But he pretended to be very angry, pushed his boat into the water and wanted to leave. He had deliberately left one of his pretty mats behind, and Mä'isila sent down to him to tell him not to forget the mat. But Kuekuaqä'oe did not want to return and so the chief sent his daughter down with the mat. The boat was already so far into the water that the girl had to wade into the sea up to her knees.  As she stood next to the boat, Kuekuaqä'oe grabbed her, pulled her into the boat and sailed away. When Mä'isila saw this, he wanted to pursue the robber, but most of the boats sank as soon as they were pushed into the water because Aints'umk'a had drilled holes in them. Some, however, pursued them and almost reached the fugitives. Then Kuekuaqä'oe threw the mats which his sisters had made, and which the salmon liked very much, into the water.  The salmon fished them up and quarrelled over who should have them.  Meanwhile he reached his home. The salmon made one more attempt to bring it back, but they were unsuccessful. Since then there have been many salmon in Wa'nuk (a place in Rivers Inlet = with a river).  6 After some time Kuekuaqä'oe gave the girl as a wife to the son of a chief of the Heista-itq (one of the northernmost tribes of the Kwakiutl, near the Skeena River). After some time, he had his sisters collect berries to give to the young woman as a gift. When they had collected many crates full, they loaded his boat and sailed to the land of the Heista-itq. Kuekuaqä'oe became greedy on the way and wanted to eat the berries.  (Follow the story, Sagas of Bilqula, No. 6. He lets his excrement cry out: "Many people are coming and want to fight with you." He then smears himself


Page 447

 He was covered all over with the red juice of the berries to make his sisters believe that he was wounded. But they soon discovered that no one was there and that he had eaten the berries).  7) Kuekuaqä'oe married a widow who had a beautiful daughter.  He built himself a house on the island of Wl'k'etse (outside Rivers Inlet). The raven wanted to take control of the girl and devised a ruse.  He made her take a bath. (Follows the story, Tales of Bilqula, No. 5. He takes wood from the yellow cedar, which she burns. He then advises her to go into the forest and look for the remedy Le'iilakis [= penis in the forest]. She then sits on it, and when she discovers what has happened, she runs away).  (8) Kuekuaqä'oe then took a pair of conch shells, carefully collected the secretion of the girl's yagina and put it inside. He placed the shells under a tree. From time to time he checked the shell and soon found a little boy inside. He grew up in four days. Kuekuaqä'oe gave him the name Ky'Iö'tl and took him home with him. There he showed him to the girl and said, "Behold, this is your brother." He then built a boat in the forest. When it was finished and he was ready to push it into the water, Ky'iö'tl asked to go with him. When they got there, they found a hat in the middle of the boat, and Kuekuaqä'oe knew that it was very dangerous to touch it. So he warned his son, but he did not obey and put on the hat, which immediately carried him up. Then Kuekuaqä'oe sat down on the shore near his house and wept for four days Suddenly he heard someone behind him say: "I am Ky'iö'tl, I have returned to you." He turned around, but did not recognize the speaker and he retorted: "You are not Ky'iö'tl, you have no hair, while his was very long. Your face is also very different." He replied: "But I am.  There is always a strong wind up there, and it has changed me so much. Take me in! Believe me, I am your son." He asked him four times in this way, but Kuekuaqä'oe did not believe him. Then he said: "Since you do not want to recognize me, I must fly back to heaven and can never return.  From now on, people will die and will never be able to return." He flew up into the sky and only then did Kuekuaqä'oe recognize him. But now he wished him back in vain and stretched out his arms towards heaven (see p. 469).  9 Kuekuaqä'oe concluded from what had happened that K'Elesiltsä'e, a great eagle, had brought the hat to steal Ky'iö'tl. He therefore decided to take revenge. He went to Mä'kyagyü (see p. 445) and asked him to carve a large one. Mä'kyagyü fulfilled his request. When the whale was ready, Kuekuaqä'oe covered it with resin and threw it into the water. He himself, the halibut, beaver and sea otters went into the whale and he made it swim to Sä'l (an island north of Malcolm Island, in Queen Charlotte Sound) where K'Elesiltsä'e lived. He was sitting in front of his house and when he saw the whale swimming towards him, he sent his youngest son NätlEmsk'EmEnkolä'k'amä (= the one who catches one) to catch the whale. The whale threw itself at him. But the whale was too heavy for him. It could not release its fangs from the resin and was drowned. Then the eagle sent his next youngest son Mae'matsEmEnkolä'k'amäe (= catching the two?) He was also drowned, although he lifted the whale a little? Then the eagle's next son, Yü'tuqsEmEnkolä'k-amäe (= the three-catching one) au met the same fate. Finally, the eldest son of K'Elesiltsäe, musk'EmEnkolä'k-amäe (= the four-catching one) flew out. The old man called out to him: "G


Page 448

 the whale by the head, not in the middle." He followed the advice and grabbed the "whale by the breathing holes and picked it up. A stubborn struggle ensued, and when the eagle grew tired, his yater came over to help him. They almost won, but the whale finally gained the upper hand and descended into the depths with such force that it became stuck on the seabed. The beaver and the sea otters had to get out and dig it free again. Then they returned to Kuekuaqä'oe's home.  10. once Kuekuaqä'oe asked the deer Tlek'EkwIlak': "When are you at your fattest?" He replied: "In summer, when there are many berries." When summer came, Kuekuaqä'oe said: "Come, let's cry together!" They went out, sat down at the edge of a precipice, and Kuekuaqä'oe began: "A long time ago, my father gave away as many blankets as there are tree stumps in the whole world." Then Tlek'EkwIlak sang: "A long time ago, my father gave away as many blankets as there are leaves on the trees and shells on the beach." Then Kuekuaqä'oe shouted: "You want me for the best! Your father never did that!" and pushed him into the abyss.  Then he carried him home and ate him.  11 Stskin's older brothers went into the forest to hunt. But they returned without any prey and were very sad because they had nothing to eat.  So Stskin took his bow and arrows and went into the forest. He soon spotted a gray bear. He sat down on a branch in front of him and mocked him by shouting, "0, how big is your nose!" The bear became angry and devoured him. But Stskin flew back out to the bear unharmed, sat down on a branch again and mocked him. The bear swallowed him a second time, but Stskin flew out the back again.  The bear swallowed him for the third and fourth time. Then Stskin broke his bow in the bear's stomach and turned it into a firebrand. He used his raincoat as tinder and lit a big fire in the bear's stomach. Then he flew out the back again. At first the bear had to cough as the rising smoke irritated his throat. Then the flames burst out of all his natural openings and he burned miserably. Stskin flew home and said to his mother, "Call all the people and let them go into the forest with me, I have killed a big bear. His mother didn't believe him, but said, "You're not going to lie to me that you've caught something when your older brothers have come back empty-handed, are you?" So Stskin took a knife, flew into the forest and cut off the bear's nose. He brought it to his mother, and she knew that little Stskin had killed the bear.  Many men went with him into the forest to fetch the bear, including the raven. They cut up the bear and found that it was very fat. The greedy raven wanted to have all the fat for himself. He thought: "Oh, if only they would give me the fat to carry." No sooner had he thought this than the men said, "Let the raven carry the fat," and they tied it on his back. Soon he was left behind and the men had to wait for him.  When they asked him why, he said that the fat was rattling off his back.  So they tied it up again. But soon he was left behind again. The men became impatient and told him to follow them alone. But he had only wanted to, and now he ate all the fat. Then he hit his leg with a stone so that he hurt himself a little and flew home. "0", he said, "I almost died. I climbed a steep mountain


Page 449

 fell down." But they did not believe him, for they knew his tricks and pranks. But the raven had eaten too much and often had to go and relieve himself. The boy Matsilq, K*atsitä'la's son, followed him and saw that he was not excrementing but fat. But he kept calling out: "0, I feel so sick! A hair has come out of my anus." Then Matsilq shouted: "He's lying; it's only bear fat that's coming out." Then the people knew that the raven had stolen all the fat. But he also wanted the meat, which was cooked in large cauldrons. He went out, did his business and said to his excrement: "Call out right now: 0, o, many boats are coming." They obeyed and all the men ran out into the street to look for the boats. Meanwhile, the raven ate all the meat.  2 Nöak'aua (= the wise man) and Masmasaläniq.  After the raven had freed the sun, Nöak'aua and Masmasa läniq descended from the sky to make everything beautiful and good.  Nöak'aua thought: "0, if only Masmasalä'niq would divide the land and the water;" and Masmasalä'niq divided the land from the water. And again Nöak'aua thought: "0, if only Masmasalä'niq would create the olach;" and Masmasalä'niq created the oily fish. Then Nöak'aua thought: "0, let Masmasalä'niq make a path leading up that mountain;" and Masmasalä'niq did so.  And further Nöak'aua thought: "0, Masmasalä'niq made a cave in this mountain and he created many berries on the summit. 0, he carved people out of cedar wood, men and women, and he made them boats and oars." And Masmasalä'niq carried out all of Nöak'aua's thoughts. Nöak'aua thought further: "0, Masmasalä'niq made a box with four compartments for the dancing flutes."  And so Masmasaläniq did. He made a box with four compartments. He put the flute of Hä'mat'sa in the compartment at the front left, the Tsä'ek'a or Tlök'oa'la flutes at the front right, the Tlöola'qa dance flutes at the back left and the Me'itla flutes at the back right. Then Nöak'aua thought: "0, Masmasalä'niq made a five-part flute," and Masmasalä'niq made a flute with the voices of the k'ö'itsa, t'e'iqtlala, kuai'ik a (ducks), ä'qaqöne and the mouse. And further Nöak'aua thought: "0, Masmasalä'niq made the dancing stick; o, he went into the AVald and looked for the cedar; o, he made the stone axe to cut down the cedar; o, he made the box to keep dried salmon. 0, he made the grater lighter so that the people would have fire, and he looked for yellow cedar wood that had lain in the water for a long time to ignite it by rubbing; o, he made the bast beater and beat the cedar bast soft to make tinder."  And Masmasalä'niq carried out all of Nöak'aua's thoughts. Nöak'aua thought further: "0, Masmasalä'niq made a net in which people could catch fish."  Masmasalä'niq tried, but he did not succeed. So he went to the spider and asked it to make a net for him. She complied with his request. She also made the neck ring from red cedar bast for the winter dance, and the basket, and taught Masmasalä'niq how to peel the cedars. And Nöak'aua thought: "0, if only Masmasalä'niq would sharpen a bone and give it to the spider to split the bast with." And Masmasalä'niq sharpened the bone and the spider made bast threads. Then Nöak'aua thought: "0, Masmasalä'niq made the edible roots, houses, paintings, carvings and masks;" and Mas masalä'niq did so. When everything was finished, Nöak'aua and Masmasalä'niq made a great noise in the sky and the people came to life. Then Nöak'aua told the people to marry and said to them: "If you don't eat berries, the Berl. Anthropol. Society 1893. 29


Page 450

 If you find more at the foot of the mountain, use the path we have made; go up and you will find plenty of berries." The people obeyed.  Many young men had not been given wives. Nöak'aua told them to go up the mountain through the cave and steal the berry-seeking women at the top.  The young people now ran up the mountain through the cave. The cave was so low in many places, however, that those who ran too impetuously hit their heads on the ceiling and lost their lives. The others suddenly appeared at the top of the mountain, robbed the women looking for berries and then hurried back through the cave. Those who did not escape quickly enough were killed by the men who were defending their wives.  Then Nöakaua thought: "0, Masmasaläniq taught the people to make traps in which they could catch the raccoon." And Masmasalä'niq taught them to catch bears and make coats from their skins. He sent four men into the forest, who were the first to catch bears.  And Nöak-aua thought further: "0, let Masmasalä'niq get the fire."  But Masmasalä'niq could not. So he first sent the ermine to the house of the man who was guarding the fire. It secretly took the fire in its mouth and wanted to run away. Then the man asked: "Where are you going?" But the ermine could not answer, because it had the fire in its mouth. So he slapped him hard in the face and the fire fell to the ground. As the stoat had been unsuccessful, Nöak'aua sent the stag. He first went to Masmasaläniq to have his legs made slim and fast.  And Nöak-aua thought: "If only Masmasalä'niq wanted to put spruce wood on the deer's tail." And Masmasalä'niq put spruce wood on the deer's tail. Quick-footed, he ran away. He came to the house where the fire was and danced around it, singing: "I want to find the light!" And suddenly he turned his back against the flames, so that the wood caught fire at his tail, and he ran away. But fire fell to the ground everywhere, which the people carefully guarded. The stag called out to the wood standing by the path: "Hide the fire!" It caught fire and has been combustible ever since.  And further Nöak aua thought: "0, if only Masmasalä'niq made a whale out of wood and coated it with resin;" and Masmasalä'niq did so. On a distant mountain lived the bird K-ani'sltsua, which used to rob people. Nöak aua wanted to catch it. He let all the people go into the whale, Masmasalä'niq then closed the whale and let it into the water. He swam to K'ani'sltsua's house. He sent his three sons Memensk'amF.'nk'oa, MaimasemE'nk'oa and YaiutqsEmE'nk'oa in turn to lift the whale, but they all stuck to the resin; the whale was too heavy for them and pulled them down. Then K'ani'sltsua sent out his youngest son M mosk-amE'nk-oa (the names mean: the one, two, three, four lifter) He rejoiced, put on his eagle's clothes and flew down to catch the whale. But he too clung to it, the whale pulled him down and he lay on the water with broken wings. K-ani'sltsua also finally lost his life.  And Nöak'aua thought: "When we are old, we want to die."  But Masmasalä'niq always wanted to stay alive. But the little bird K"'oe'qtsa very much wanted Nöak'aua and Masmasalä'niq to die. He said: "Where shall I live if you stay alive forever? I will build my nest in your grave and warm myself." Nöak-aua did not know what to do


Page 451

 and said to the bird: "All right, we will die, but we will rise again after four days." But the bird was not satisfied with this, it wanted them to die completely. So Noak aua and Masmasalä'niq decided to die and then return as children. They died and went up to the sky to see if people were mourning them. There they saw that all the people were wailing, and then they turned into droplets of blood that blew down to earth with the wind. In their sleep, the women inhaled them, and as a result, all of them gave birth to children. Thus Nöalraua and Masmasalä'niq returned to earth.  3. the mink.  1) Once Mink said to his mother: "I am hungry and want to eat shellfish. I want to fight with Yä'eqöek'oa (see p. 469) so that he will let the tide go out." This was a mighty chief who lived at the bottom of the water. The mother let the mink go. He swam out and attacked Yä'eqöek'oa. At last he succeeded in mastering him and held him under water until he began to lose his breath. Then he called out: "Let me go, I will also let the water recede so that you can collect shells." Mink was happy with this, let go of him and swam back home. The sea receded a little and he found a shell. When he returned home, his mother asked: "Well, what did you find?" He showed her the shell and immediately swam back out to fight Yä'eqöek'oa again. He defeated him again and the latter let the water recede a little further and stay out longer. Mink then found six shells under the stones and brought them to his mother. But he was not yet satisfied. Only after he had defeated the water spirit four times did he make the sea recede long enough and far enough for him to get a basket full of shells. Satisfied, he let his mother taste the mussels and they both ate their fill. Then he patted his stomach with pleasure.  2) Once Mink played hoops with the ducks (Kual'ik'a) and won the game. Then they shot arrows at a stick to see who could shoot best. He won this too. Then they all attacked him and broke his bow. But he fought back and bit the ducks. Then they said to him to insult him: "You have no father at all." Tle'selagyila (= the sun maker), the mink, was saddened by this and ran crying to his mother to ask her if he really had no father.  She comforted her son and said: "Let her cry, your father is up in heaven. His name is Toatusela'kilis and he makes the sun shine."  Then Mink decided to visit him. He went to his uncle Hanatliaqtä'o (i.e. the archer) and had a new bow made. When he got it, he shot an arrow at the sky and it stuck there. The second arrow stopped in the first, and continuing in this way, he made a chain that reached down from the sky to the earth. Tle'selagyila climbed up this chain and finally reached the sky. There he met Toatusela'kilis' wife - for his father had remarried. - When she recognized Tle'selagyila, she said: "Your father will be very happy to see you. You can now lead the sun instead of him." In the evening, when it was getting dark, the father came home. The woman said to him: "Your son has come and wants to stay with you. Now let him lead the sun instead of you." Toatusela'kilis was very happy, and early in the morning he woke his son. 29*


Page 452

 He gave him his clothes and told him to climb slowly behind the mountains and warned him not to go too fast, otherwise everything would burn. Mink took his father's clothes and slowly ascended as he had been instructed. But when it was almost noon, he became impatient and began to run, setting the whole earth on fire. The inhabitants of the earth jumped into the "water to escape the flames and were transformed into real people (whereas before they had been half-animals). But the woman in heaven called her husband and told him to throw Tle'selagyila down to the earth, otherwise everything would burn. Toatusela'kilis rushed over, tore off his clothes and threw him down to the earth, saying: "If you had walked properly, you would always have been allowed to lead the sun." Mink fell into the sea among many floating tree trunks. There the people found him and carried him home.  4. the moon.  1 Gyä'löyak'ame (= the very first) lived with his father K-'ö'muk-'ömgyila.  One day he decided to go out in his boat. He pushed the boat into the water and went out into the wide sea. There he met K'ömö'k'oa, who tried to catch the boat and the skipper. Then Gyä'löyak'ame ordered the boat to rise into the air, and behold, it flew away like a bird. It soared higher and higher and finally reached the sky. There he found a loc stuck his head through it and asked: ""Don't people live up here?" he heard someone answer: "Yes, we live here, the Wa'qsk'Em (- face both sides), but we are not happy, because we have our mouths on our necks." Then Gyä'löyak'ame said: "If I have a child one day, it shall be called like you." And he sailed on in his boat. After some time, he saw a house below him. The boat first circled above it, and then sank lower and lower until it finally landed in front of the house. Tlä'k'oagyila (the copper plate maker) lived in the house. His wife was cradling her ki, which was constantly crying. To quiet it, she said: "Don't cry, Gyä'löyak'ame will come for you." The child fell asleep, the woman lay down, and when everyone was asleep, Gyä'löyak'ame crept into the house and stole the child from the cradle. After a while, the woman woke up and, as she continued to move the cradle, she realized that it was empty. Then she shouted: "Tlä'k gyila! Someone has stolen our child" and wept very much. But Gyä'löyak'ame immediately came in and said to them: "Stop crying, here is Eu's child, I just wanted to know his name." The father was delighted and said: "His name is Tlä'tlak'oasila (= the one who counts copper). When your sister has a child, let her give this name to her eldest son. The second child, a girl, should be called Tläk'oagyilaiöö'k'oa (= the one who makes copper), the third, a boy, Sekyök'oa'la (= the sounding copper), and the last, a girl, Tlä'k oitl (= copper in the house). Now go on to AiHts'umgyila (= the one who works the halio shells)." Gyä'löyak'ame got into his boat and flew on. Ba he found AiHts'umgyila's house; again the boat circled over it and slowly descended. Then Gyä'löyak'ame also stole the child from him to find out his name. When he brought it back, AiHts'umgy said, "When your sister has children, she shall name the eldest, a boy, after our son AiHts'umk-'ä'naq (= the one who cleans shells). The next, a girl, shall be called Aiiits'umk'a (= the shining one); the third, a boy, shall be called AiHts'umalitl (= haliotis in the house) and the youngest, a girl, Aints'umk anlitl (= box full of haliotis shells)." Gyälöyakame returns


Page 453

 Then he returned to earth and told his sisters what he had experienced. Then he went up into the sky and became the moon.  2) A young girl waited for her brother while their mother had gone out to catch Olachen. As the Kuabe kept crying, she wrapped him in her coat, carried him around the street and gave him a small bucket to play in. As he wouldn't shut up, she threatened him that the moon would come and get him. And when he still wouldn't stop, she threatened him a second, third and fourth time. Then the moon heard her. It descended to the earth, and as it came down, it became huge. He took the boy with him up to the moon. Even today you can see the boy with the bucket in his hand in the moon.  3) A young man named Me'itla went up to the sky ten times in one year. The first time he found a seagull up there and brought it down with him. The second time he went up, he found a bird with a red beak, the third time the "Salmonberries", then the diver and the bird Qe'qeqe. The sixth time he brought down the bird AtE'mkuli.  But when he went up for the tenth time, he found the moon Nüsnü'selis and did not return. Then his mother Tleelaiak's and his father R-'ömqtö'is wept and lamented. Finally they fell asleep. In her dream, the mother saw a beautiful house in front of her, and when she woke up, she realized that it was not a dream, but really stood before her. She saw her son Me'itla playing in front of the house and woke her husband so that he could see him too. When the father woke up, he also saw the house and the boy and shouted: "There's our lost son!" They jumped up and ran towards the house. But it seemed to shrink away from them and finally they realized that it was actually far away, up in the sky. Then they sat down and wept and sang: "0, our son is playing up there at Nüsnü'selis. He is in a foreign land and will not return to us." As they were singing, their niece passed by and they told her that they had seen Me'itla playing in heaven above. Then she said: "We want your son to appear again in the dance." The parents agreed. They made their niece, whose name was K,'ök,öme'tsemk,a, dance in the guise of Me'itla and gave her his name.  5th Me'maotlEme.  One hot summer day, four brothers went out into the sea to bathe. They found a tree trunk on the shore on which they lay down to sleep. While they were resting there, the trunk began to drift, and when they woke up, there was no land to be seen around them. For a long time they drifted here and there. At last they saw a black stripe on the horizon. They came closer and saw a black coast. The youngest brother jumped from the tree trunk onto the shore, but lo and behold, the land disappeared and he drowned. After a while they reached a similar land; the second youngest jumped off the trunk and he too drowned. For a long time the two survivors drifted about on the trunk. At last the second brother became so tired that he could no longer hold on, and he too drowned. Only the eldest remained, and after a long journey he finally reached the land of the chief ME'nis (see p. 444). Here he found a river flowing out of a lake. He went up and sat down on the shore of the lake. In the evening, Lalalr'aiyulroa, ME'nis' daughter, came out of the house to draw water. When she saw the man


Page 454

 she asked him where he came from, and Me'maotlEme, for that was his name, he counted his fortunes. Then she invited him to come to her Yater's house.  He followed her, and inside she offered him food from a large box. She took out something he did not recognize, mixed it with water and "crabapples" and set it before him. When Me'maotlEme wanted to start eating, he saw that it was human eyes, and he refused to eat such food. After some time, ME'nis happened to go into a room in his house, and when he opened the door, Me'maotlEme saw seals lying inside, and he said to Lalak' aiyuk'oa: "Cook me some of this, it's what we used to eat in our country."  The girl told her father of her guest's wish, and he took a stick and beat a seal to death. The daughter then cut it up and cooked it. But she was very disgusted that Me'maotlEme wanted to eat such food, because the seals were her dogs.  ME'nis, however, gave his daughter to the guest as his wife. Not far from the house was a fish weir, and close to it a pole was erected on which an eagle sat, which cried out every time the weir was full of fish. Early in the morning, when Me'maotlEme was still in bed, the eagle cried out. Then Lalak-'aiyuk-oa nudged her husband and said: "Why don't you go down to the weir and take out the salmon?" Me'maotlEme went down and found the bodies of his brothers in the weir.  One of them had had his eye pecked out by a raven. Then he wept. When his wife heard him weeping, she got up, went to him and asked about the cause of his grief. When he showed her the corpses of his brothers, she said: "Don't be sad, my father will raise them again." She fetched her father and he carried the bodies into the house. He took an eye out of the box and put it in one of the brothers instead of the one that had been hacked out; he shook them and they came back to life.  One day one of the brothers was playing with a piece of cedar wood and Lä lak,'aiyuk'oa told him that the wood was very valuable and that her father had to pay a very high price for it. The man was amazed at this and counted how many cedars grew in his homeland. When ME'nis heard about this through his daughter, he asked the brothers to visit their relatives and bring him lots of cedar wood. But they had no boat. So ME'nis gave them his fur boat and told them to leave. But they were afraid to cross the sea in the fur boat. ME'nis encouraged them. He gave them one of each of the animals he kept as dogs in the many rooms of his house, including a porcupine, and told them to set off.  Lalak 'aiyuk'oa went with them and said: "Always steer towards the rising sun and keep the setting sun behind you, then you will reach your home."  They obeyed and reached their home village after a long journey.  No one had seen the boat coming. The youngest brother jumped ashore and went to greet his father. But he did not recognize him at first.  Then he had his house cleaned and threw a big party. The sons gave him all kinds of animals, the gift of the chief ME'nis. Then they asked all the people to go into the forest and fetch cedar bark, which they wanted to bring to Mfi'nis as a gift. They loaded a boat made from a cedar tree and returned. Lalalc'aiyuk'oa told them to sail towards the setting sun and keep the rising sun at their backs. They obeyed, and after passing the two deceptive black islands, they arrived happily at Mfi'nis. The daughter went to her father and told him,


Page 455

 that they had been well catered for and given rich gifts. And Mß'ni's heart was glad when he saw the cedar bark, the boat and all the things he had never seen before. And he decided to copy everything.  6 R-'ömk-'ö'mgyila.  R-'ömk-'ö'mgyila, a chief of the Nö'quntsitq, had the daughter of the chief of the north as his wife. She was called Tläkoagyilaö'koa (= the copper made), Tlä'k-uitl (= plucker in the house), R-'ak-'anqp'ä'lak-a (= copper smell) and Tlii' k-oetlk-'e'naq. Their father's name was Tlä'k-oagyila (= the one who makes copper), and the land in which he lived was D'a'k'ö. They had a pair of twin daughters and lived quietly in Nö'quntsitq for a number of years. But then K'ömk-'ö'mgyila wanted to visit the chiefs of the other directions and get to know their countries. The chief of the east is Alagyilak-Emäe (= the first of the fur coats). He decided to visit him first. When they boarded the boat, his daughters refused to go with him. He asked: "What will you live on when we are gone?" They replied: "We are salmon. If we swim in the water, many fish will come1)." R-'ömk-'ö'mgyila finally left his daughters behind and traveled east with his wife and four slaves. They traveled up the Nö'qunt River, as far as it was navigable, and then walked eastward on foot. Finally, after a long hike, they came to four lakes and saw a large hole in the ground from which the sun always emerged in the morning.  His wife told him that they had now arrived in the land of Alagyilak'Emäe.  As they saw no one, R-'ömk-'ö'mgyila called out: "Does no one live here in this hole?" As no one answered, he called out again and again, but it was only after he had called out four times that Älagyilak-Emäe appeared. He had a face in front and behind and only a strip of hair in the middle of his head: "What do you want here?" he said. K-'ömk-'ö'mgyila replied: "I want to marry your daughter." The chief said, "What do you want to do with her? You can't marry her." He replied, "Yes, I can marry her as well as any other woman." Älagyilak'Emäe then went into the hole to fetch his daughter. Her name was Ä'lagyilayük'oa (= the fur coat made) and Alagyimitl (= fur coat in the house). When he brought her, K-'ömk-'ö'mgyila saw that she was a very small cow, but Alagyilak'emäe forced him to marry her and gave him many fur blankets and the water of life. After some time, R-'ömk-'ö'mgyila traveled back to his homeland. Then the chief said: "If you have children, name them after my daughter and after me." When the traveler arrived home, he saw smoke rising from the roof and found his daughters well supplied with fish. Then he decided to look for his father-in-law Tlä'k-oagyila, the chief in the north. He loaded his boat with many ceder bast nets and dancing equipment. Then they set off. At last they came to a mountain that blocked their way, and R-'ömk-'ö'mgyila did not know how to proceed. But his wife knew the way. She covered the whole boat with fur coats so that no water could splash into it. Then she stopped the boat in front of a steep rock and waited until the water was low. Then a large cave became visible that led through the whole mountain. They drove through it 1) The Kwakiutl believe that twins are transformed salmon and that they have power over fish (see p. 445, Anraerk.).


Page 456

 and saw Tlä'k'oagyila's house on the other side. When the people saw them, they shouted to each other: "They must be mighty strangers who have come through the mountain." They did not know that it was the boat of their chief's daughter. But when they reached the shore, her father recognized them. He led them into the house and set a box of human eyes in front of them to eat. But the daughter said: "My husband won't eat that, give him seal meat!" So the people killed seals and gave them to him to eat. K''öm k''ömgyila gave his father-in-law the nets and the dance jewelry he had brought with him. After some time, they returned to their home. Tlä' k'oagyila kept his son-in-law's boat and gave him a copper boat instead, which was shaped like a box and had a hole at each end.  He filled the boat with copper plates and named it Tlä'k'oagyila for his children.  He did not visit the chief Gyö'gwisiläkEmäe (= the first of the conch shells) of the south and AiHts'umgylla (= haliotis maker, or the one who makes it shiny) of the west.  7. k'ek'tsumuskyä'na.  Once upon a time there was a man called Apö'tl. One day he was invited to a feast, and when the meal was over, he had a boy carry home a bowl of the leftover food for his wife and four sons. The boy obeyed, and when Apö'tl's sons, who had been lying in their beds on the side boards above the platform, saw the large bowl full of meat and berries, they got up and jumped down to eat. But the mother said, "This is not for you; Apö'tl has sent the food for me. If you want something, go to K'ek'tsumu skyä'na and get it there." But K'ek'tsumuskyä'na was a human eater who lived in a distant land. The sons became sad and defiant. They went back to bed and stayed there for four days without eating or drinking. On the fourth day, the villagers saw a beautiful bird (a swan?) swimming around near the houses. The children tried to catch it, but could not get hold of it. When Apö'tl's sons heard about this, they got up, took their bows and arrows in a wooden box and got into their boat. When they got close to the bird, they shot it. The arrow hit, but did not kill the bird.  It swam away and the boys chased after it. They often came close to it and then shot it with their arrows. But no matter how often they shot, they were unable to kill the bird. So the bird lured them far out to sea. Finally, however, they managed to catch it.  Then they wanted to return home, but lo and behold, all around them there was nothing but sky and water, and even the peaks of the highest mountains had disappeared. The boys did not know where to turn.  But not enough; soon after they had caught the bird, an icy wind began to blow and they now knew that the bird was the master of the wind. The sea began to freeze and with great difficulty they had to find their way through densely packed blocks of ice. After they had sailed around for a while without knowing where to go, one of the brothers' oars broke. He became tired, fell asleep and finally died of cold and hunger. After a short time, the second brother's oar broke. He also froze to death. Then the two survivors took the


Page 457

 They wrapped themselves in their brothers' coats. But the third finally died of hunger and cold. When the eldest saw himself all alone, he hid himself in the cloaks and wept bitterly. After a short time he began to slumber. Suddenly, however, he woke up, for he felt that the boat had come ashore. He pushed his oar into the water and felt the bottom. There was not a soul to be seen on the shore and so he was afraid to get out.  At last, however, he saw some footprints, and now he took heart, wrapped himself in his cloak and followed the tracks after pulling the boat to shore. He had not gone far when he came to a village. He went into the first house and found two boys there. As they did not notice him, he tapped them on the shoulder. They turned and asked: "Where are you from?" When he had told them his fate, they said: "This is K'ek'tsuniHskyä'na's land. If you have courage and strength enough, kill her and take her daughter as your wife." Then the boy replied: "Yes, I have courage and will go through with the adventure." The boys told him that many men had already come to marry the girl, but that K-ektsumHskyä'na had killed them all. They asked: "Can you jump and run well? Otherwise she will surely kill you." He replied that he could jump well. In the meantime, the men who had been out hunting had returned and he was given something to eat. But his heart was sad as he thought of his dead brothers lying outside in the boat. But an old woman comforted him by saying, "Be of good cheer, if you have killed K'ek'tsumHskyä'na, we will raise them up again." And they asked him if he was brave. He replied that he had only wanted to kill them for a long time. Then the two boys he had met first asked him to show them whether he could jump and run. He stepped outside the door of the house and jumped as far as the house was wide in one leap.  Before he went away, however, he had four little girls make a deep pit near the fire, and he told the boys to cook poison and keep it ready to use at the right time. Then he went to Kek'tsumuskyä'na's house. At the door he found the bird K'ak'a'nis standing guard. The bird wanted to make noise, but the young man won him over by handing him a fish. Then he opened the door and found the bird T'ästumä'kua standing guard inside, to which he also handed a fish and thus won him over. He entered and saw the old woman lying on her bed sleeping right next to the door. And he noticed that the sides of her hands were as sharp as knives. She used to use them to kill anyone who approached her. But K'ek'tsumHskyäW's daughter was sitting by the fire. The young man approached her and asked her: "Will you be my wife, and is it right for you if I kill your wicked mother?" She replied: "Yes, I have long wanted to marry her, but she kills all my suitors. Now you kill her." She had quickly grown fond of the young man and asked anxiously, "But are you strong enough?" When he encouraged her, she said: "So kill her now while she is still asleep; when she is awake, you will surely succumb." Then the young man leapt at the woman and held her tightly in his arms. She woke up and shouted: "hr! hr! hr! hr!" as she struck out with her sharp hands. But when she tried to hit him, he nimbly jumped to the side. He finally tied her up and carried her into the house where the villagers were anxiously awaiting the end of the fight. There he threw her into the pit and poured the poison on her so that she died.


Page 458

 The next day he said to the people: "Now go down into the pit and get the body out!" But they were all afraid and did not dare to go down. So he had a rope of cedar bast wrapped around his body, went down himself and took the body out. Then he cut off her hands, chopped up the rest of the body and threw the pieces to the winds. These were transformed into K ak atsumalä's forest flower. He kept his hands, however, as they were powerful magic tools. With his left hand he could harm his enemies, with his right he could heal the sick and raise the dead. He made a cut in the latter, and let the watery liquid that dripped out instead of blood drip onto his dead brothers. Then they woke up, rubbed their eyes as if they had slept for a long time, and went into the house. all the people saw that he had awakened his brothers. And there lived a chief whose son had been killed by K'ek'tsumuskyä'na. He said to the young man: "0, awaken my son too!" and all those whose sons and brothers had been killed by K-elrtsurnHskyä'na asked him to awaken them. So he went to their house and found the bones lying around, like a heap of shells. He sprinkled them all with the liquid dripping from his right hand, and all those whose bones still had a little flesh on them revived. He could not call the others back to life, so the young man became a great chief and took K'ek'tsumHskyä'na's daughter as his wife.  After some time, his heart yearned for his homeland. He loaded his boat with all his possessions and his wife put her boxes full of blankets and meat in it. It was so heavily laden that the brothers doubted whether it could carry everything. When they wanted to leave, they did not know which way their home lay. Then the woman said, "Close your eyes and the boat will go by itself." And they did as she had told them.  When it became dark, the boat struck land, and when they opened their eyes, they saw that they had arrived at their home. But there was no light in their parents' house, as if no one lived there. So the eldest brother sent the younger ones up and told his mother to clean her house and make it ready to receive her sons and daughter-in-law.  They obeyed. They went up and, when they opened the door, saw their father and mother sitting by a small fire. Then they nudged them with their feet and said, "Get up and clean your house. Your children have returned and your eldest son has taken K'ek'tsumiiskyäW's daughter as his wife." But the old man did not recognize her and replied, "Why do you speak such words to us? We have lost our sons." They said, "Don't you recognize us, we are your children and have now returned." Then Apö'tl stood up to greet his children. But he was weak and it was difficult for him. He went to his brother's house and told him that his children had returned; he broke wood for a fire and soon all the villagers knew that the brothers had returned.  They went down to the boat and said sadly to the eldest brother: "0, you will not recognize our parents, they have grown so old."  The brothers had been away for years, although it seemed like only days to them. When the house had been cleaned, three men and a woman spread mats from the door to the beach, escorted the new arrivals to the house and carried their things out of the boat. Then they all saw the young woman.  She was very beautiful. Her hair was long and fell over both her shoulders. Soon


Page 459

 the whole load was carried into the house except for a small crate that no one could lift. When the young woman heard this, she sent the four brothers in turn to the beach to fetch the crate. But none of them could lift it. She laughed and said, "How come no one can lift my box? It's so small and light!" She then went down to the boat herself, picked it up and carried it up to the house as if there was nothing inside.  And she opened the box, and, lo and behold, it contained everything the heart could wish for: Fat mountain goats, seals and whales; and she gave them to all the people. However much she took out of the box, it always remained full. But the brothers remained sad because their parents were so old and weak. So the woman went to the beach and drew some water in her little bucket. Then she undressed the old men and washed their whole bodies. Then they became as beautiful as they had been when they were young.  8 Baqbakuälanusi'uae (= the one who always ate human flesh at the mouth of the river).  A man named Noak'au'a had four sons. They once wanted to go hunting mountain goats. Before they set off, their father warned them and said, "If you see a house from which reddish smoke is rising, do not go in, because Baqbakuälanusi'uae, a bad person, lives there." The sons promised to follow his warning and went into the mountains. After some time, they saw a house from which black smoke was rising. The black bear lived there. When they had gone a little further, they came to a house from which white smoke was rising. The mountain goat lived here. At last she came to the house her father had warned her about, from which reddish smoke was rising. They stopped and said to each other: "We don't want to have found this house for nothing. Come along! Let us go in and see who is inside." So they did, and met a woman cradling her child; opposite her sat a boy with a monstrously thick head. The four brothers approached the fire and sat down on a box. The eldest bumped against a stick so that blood oozed from his lower leg. The boy with the big head looked at his mother and said, "0, Mutt would like to lick the blood." But the mother told him not to. The boy turned his head and then began to lick the blood off with his fingers. Then the eldest brother nudged the youngest and said: "We should have followed our father." Meanwhile, the boy began to lick up the blood more greedily. Then the eldest brother grabbed his bow and shot an arrow out of the door. Then the youngest brother ordered him to fetch the arrow again. He went out, did not return, but ran as fast as he could towards his home. Then the eldest took a second arrow, shot it out of the door and told his second brother to fetch it again. The latter also fled. When he shot the third arrow out of the door, the third brother fled. Then the boy began to be afraid. The woman asked, "Aren't your brothers coming back?" and he replied, "They only went to get my arrows back." Then he shot a fourth arrow, went out himself and ran after his brothers. When the woman realized that her guests had not returned, she stepped outside the door and called out: "Baqbakuälanusi'ue, come home. I let our good food run away." Baqbakuälanusi'uae heard her, even though he was far away. He chased after them and shouted: "Harn, ham, ham!" (Eat, eat, eat!) The four


Page 460

 The brothers heard him approaching and ran as fast as their legs would carry them. The eldest brother was carrying a "whetstone, a comb and fish oil, which he used as hair oil. Baqbakuälanusl'uae had already come very close to them when he put the whetstone down behind him and lo and behold, it turned into a mountain, forcing the pursuer to take a long detour. But he soon came close to them again. Then the young man poured out the hair oil behind him and it turned into a large lake. When Baqbakuälanusl'uae had come close to them again, he stuck the comb into the ground behind him and it turned into a dense thicket of young trees, which the pursuer also had to bypass. In the meantime, the young men had happily reached home. They knocked on the door and asked their father to open it quickly, as the man he had warned them about was following them. Nöak'aua had barely let them in and closed the door again when Baqbakuälanusl'uae arrived and demanded to be let in. Nöak'aua now took a dog, cut it up and let the blood run into a bowl. Then he had Baqba kuälanusl'uae come to a small opening in the wall, handed him the bowl and said: "This is the blood of my sons. Take it and carry it to your wife." The latter took it. Then Tsö'enä, Nöak-aua's wife, dug a deep pit near the fire and let it flare up. Then she placed stones in it, which quickly became red-hot. But they covered the hole with a stretched-out fur. Soon Baqbakuälanusl'uae arrived in his boat with his wife and three children to visit Nöak'aua. He left the youngest child by the boat as a guard, while the others went into the house with him. Tsö'enä had them sit down close to the fire so that their backs were turned towards the stretched-out fur that hid the pit. Then Baq bakuälanusl'uae said to Nöak'aua: "You know how it all started. Tell me about it." Nöak'aua replied: "I will tell you this: "What will I tell you now about ancient times, grandsons? A long time ago there was a cloud on that mountain. Soon you will sleep."  When he had sung this saying twice, Baqbakuälanusl'uae and his whole family fell asleep; and when he had sung it four times, they were fast asleep. Nöak'aua and Tsö'enä now pulled the back of their seat away and they all fell into the hole. Then they threw the glowing stones into the pit. Baq bakuälanusl'uae shouted twice more: "Ham, ham!" then he was dead. After some time, they pulled the bodies out with a rope. Nöak'aua then cut them into many pieces, scattered them over the earth and sang: "One day, Baqbakuälanusl'uae, you will persecute the people." Then they were transformed into mosquitoes.  9) The Ts'ilkigyila or Atsi.  A number of children once roasted salmon between heated stones.  When they were done, they ate and then ran into the forest to play.  Among them was a girl called Tsumriqsta (the mouthless). She ran ahead and the other children called out to each other: "Which one of us will catch Tsunmqsta first?" They had not been running for long when they came across Ts'ilkigyila, who was carrying a large basket on her back. She grabbed TsumHqsta first and put her in it, and then put all the other children on top. But the girl happened to have a knife in her hand.  She used it to cut a slit in the basket and all the children fell out.  But Ts'ilkigyila didn't notice, she just said, "I think pine needles


Page 461

 fall to the ground." Only one little boy could not jump out of the hole as he was stuck in the basket. So Ts'ilkigyila carried him home. She put the basket on the ground and was very surprised to find only the boy. She took him out of the basket and set him down. Then he saw that there were many boxes full of mountain goat fat in the house. Ts'ilkigyila now made the boy her slave. When she went out again, the boy looked around the house and now saw an old slave girl; her names were K-'ö'koikya and Tlö'k'opak'titl. Ts'ilkigyila had once robbed her in her basket just as she had now robbed the boy. The slave girl called the latter to her and said to him: "If Ts'ilkigyila wants to give you something to eat, don't take it, otherwise it will happen to you as it happened to me. Behold, I ate of her mountain goat fat, and there I became attached to the earth." She then showed him that a rope grew out of her buttocks and branched out into the earth like a root. She continued: "Hide the food under your cloak and act as if you were eating." When Ts'il kigyila returned, she offered the boy mountain goat fat, but he followed the slave girl's advice and only pretended to eat. In "truth, he hid the fat under his coat.  Ts'ilkigyila now went out again to catch slaves. Then the woman called the boy to her again and told him to go to the other side of the bay, which stretched out in front of the house, and collect mussels. The boy listened. He brought the shells and then the slave girl told him to cook them.  After he had cleaned and chopped the shells, he put the baleen on his fingertips like finger cots. When they heard Ts'ilkigyila coming back, the boy went outside the house and stretched out his fingers towards her. Then she said, "What is that on your fingers? I have never seen anything like it and I am afraid." K'Vk'oikya called out to him: "B move your fingers towards her and shout: _Ai a tsai!" The boy obeyed. Then Ts'ilkigyila was very afraid and when he had moved his hands against her four times, she fell down dead. K-'ö'k-oikya then ordered him to cut off her breasts and cook them. She said: "When Ts'ilkigyila's four sons come home from hunting, serve them this dish. They will die from it."  They soon came home. They asked about their mother and K''ö'k'oikya replied: "She will probably come soon. She has gone out with her basket to catch slaves. We have cooked for you in the meantime, here is your food." The boy took the pot in which the breasts were cooked and placed it in front of the boys. He took a spoonful and gave it to the eldest.  The latter said, "This tastes just like our mother's milk." Then he gave a spoonful to the second. The latter tasted it and said, "You're right. It tastes just like our mother's milk," and the two youngest said the same when they had tasted it. But the old slave girl told them to be quiet and eat. They obeyed, but when they had finished eating, they all fell down dead. Now the boy wanted to free the slave girl, but as soon as he pulled a little on the rope that bound her to the ground, she felt terrible pain. All day long he tried in vain to untie her. When it became dark, he said: "I will go to my home and fetch my friends to help me free you." But he was afraid that he would not find Ts'ilkigyila's house again, so the old slave girl tied a ribbon around his waist and then let him go1). He finally reached his parents.  1) It remained doubtful to me whether she did not tie the ribbon to force him to return.


Page 462

 They had already mourned him for dead and were very happy when their son returned in good health and told them that all the Ts'ilkigyila were now dead. And he continued: "But the slave girl K'ö'koikya still lies in their house. She is pinned to the ground and cannot leave. Come with me and help me free her." They went after the boy, who followed the rope. They all took hold of the rope with which the slave girl was stuck. But when they pulled hard and broke it, the woman died. The rope was like a vein and blood gushed out of it, which could not be stopped. Then the people cut Ts'ilki gyila's body into small pieces and scattered them in all directions.  Then they were turned into frogs1).  10 La'lqemitl (cf. legends of the Tsims'hian).  One day many women from Tsakoalo went into the forest to look for berries. They scattered here and there, busily filling their baskets. One of these women was called La'lqemitl. As she was picking berries, looking only at the bushes and not at the ground, it happened that she stepped four times in a row into the lot of a gray bear. She became impatient and exclaimed: "Ugh! It's disgusting how dirty the whole country is!"  Suddenly, not far away, she saw a handsome young man wearing a bearskin coat. He came up to La'lqemitl and said to her: "You're scolding the bears' excrement, now let's see what you're doing." La'lqemitl obeyed and sat down. Secretly, however, she reached under her coat into her hair and pulled out a copper needle, which she placed underneath her. Then she stood up and said to the man: "See, I always do this!" But Gya'lk'Em, for this was the man's name, would not believe her and made her sit down once more. The same thing happened again and La'lqemitl knew how to deceive him four times. Then he believed her. He liked it and took her home as his wife. Then he turned into a bear and the woman now knew that she had a bear for a husband. A great fire was burning at home and when the bear went out to catch salmon, he told his wife to fetch wood. La'lqemitl obeyed and fetched good dry wood for the fire. She threw the logs on the flames and soon her fire was blazing brightly. In the evening, when her husband returned, he shook out his fur, which was full of water, against the fire. So much water flowed out that the fire went out. He became angry and said to La'lqem, "You always act as if you know and can do everything. He then went out himself to fetch wood and collected damp wood that had been lying at the bottom of the stream for a long time. He also fetched a stone with which to make a fire. Then he made a big fire and said to his wife, "You see, you must take wood like this if you want to make a fire." When he shook out his wet cloak against the fire, it flared up. On the evening of the first day that La'lqemitl spent with the bear, she gave birth to a son, who was named Gyä'p'as (= dry wood). On the evening of the second day she gave birth to a girl, who was named Gya'lk'Emk after her father. On the evening of the third day she gave birth to a son, who 1) The Ts'ilkigyila (the Tsonö'k-oa of the Kwakiutl, the Sncne'ik' of the Bilqula) performs the dance Tloolä'qa (the Sisäü'kH of the Bilqula). She carries a basket on her back into which she puts the children. A face is painted in each hand. When she opens her eye, light shines out of it.


Page 463

 Ts'e'mos (= wet wood), and finally, on the evening of the fourth day, a daughter Gya'lka. But the four days had actually been four years.  Then La'lqemitl thought: "Oh, if only I were back with my parents and could see how they were doing." Gya'lk Em soon guessed her thoughts and said: "If you want to go and see your relatives, I will not refuse you. Go and take your children with you." Before she left, he gave her his house and everything in it. They soon came to the river where she had once met the bear. The children, who were in the shape of bears, saw salmon swimming about in the water and said to each other, "0, let us go down to the river and catch salmon!" The children went down to the river while their mother hid under the flowers growing on the bank.  At the same time, La'lqemitl's brothers came to the river to catch salmon. When their wives saw the bears playing by the river, they were afraid. They fled and told the brothers that there were four bears by the river.  They immediately prepared to hunt them. They went up the river, but before they could get close to the bears, La'lqemitl emerged from the flowers and said: "Don't hurt the bears, they are your nephews." And she told them everything she had experienced since the bear had stolen her. Lie's brothers invited the young bears to go with them. But they were afraid and ran into the forest. La'lqemitl followed them and took the bearskins from them. Then they were transformed into humans. Only the youngest daughter, Gya'lk'a, did not want to have her skin removed and said to her mother: "0, mother, let me pick berries first." But she ran off into the forest and did not return. La'lqemitl now came down to the stream with her three children and asked her brothers about their parents' well-being. They replied, "0, our parents have grown old and weak," and when they saw La'lqemitl's children, they wept. They took the children into their boat and went home. Only La'lqemitl stayed behind to fetch the bear's house out of the forest and put it next to her father's house. When the boat arrived, the children got out and went up to their grandparents' house. There they stopped in front of the door and said to each other, "How bad it smells in our grandparents' house." They did not yet know that their daughter La'lqemitl had returned. Then the eldest of the brothers, Poetsit, came to them and told them how they had found La'lqemitl and her children, and that they had brought the children with them in the boat and that La'lqemitl would soon be coming too. The mother tried to get up and clean the house to receive the new arrivals, but she was so weak that she could not get up. The neighbors helped her to put the house in order.  When La'lqemitl returned and saw how weak her parents were, she was very sad. She had them come to the bear's house, which now stood close to the old people's house. There she took a small cup of water, undressed her parents and washed their whole bodies. Then they became young and beautiful again. And she rejuvenated all the old people in this way.  But in the house there were many boxes filled with many good things: Skins, salmon and mountain goat fat. She told her brother Poe'tsit to call all the people together and gave them many gifts. But no matter how much Poe'tsit took from the boxes, they were never empty.

 11 The thunderbird.  A chief had twelve slaves who always had to cut firewood for him. Since he mistreated them cruelly, they conspired against him. Once, when he wanted to whip one of the slaves, they tied him with ceder bast ropes, carried him to a lonely island and abandoned him there. There the chief wrapped himself in his cloak, covered his face and wanted to die. He had not been sitting like that for long when he felt someone tugging at him. He did not dare to get up, but only peeked through a small hole in his coat.  Then he saw a mouse sitting in front of him and tugging at his coat. He straightened up and asked: "What do you want from me?" The mouse replied: "My chief, Kunkunquli'kya, has told you to come to him!  Follow me, but make sure you jump through the door quickly enough, otherwise it will kill you." They walked away together and soon came to Kunkunquli'kya's house. The chief remembered the mouse's warning and quickly jumped through the door, but it slammed shut so quickly that it hit the skin on his heel. Kunkunquli'kya and his four daughters were sitting by the fire. Then the old man asked him: "Where have you come from and what do you want here?" The chief then told him how he had whipped his slaves and they had then abandoned him. And he asked him for his help to get back home. Kunkunquli'kya promised to fulfill his request. At night, when everyone was asleep, the chief crept up to the youngest of the daughters and wanted her as his wife. The old man heard talking in the daughter's chamber and made a fire to see what was going on. He saw strangers with his daughter, and she told her yater that she wanted a wife. Kunkunquli'kya told her to tolerate him until the next day. In the morning he gave the chief the kunqumtl (i.e. the mask and dress of Kuni'qua or Kunkunquli'kya, the thunderbird) and ordered him to fly. The latter obeyed, but at the first attempt he fell to Bo Kunkunquli'kya told him to try again. Then he managed to fly halfway around the house. On the third attempt he managed to fly a little further and on the fourth time he was able to fly as well as Kunkunquli'kya himself, who said to him: "Now you can fly all over the world and I will give you my daughter as a wife." One morning, the woman said to him, "Come on, let's catch a whale!" They put on their wings and flew out. When they saw a whale, the woman called out to him: "Grab its head, I'll grab its tail." So they caught the whale and carried it to the shore. Then the woman made a hundred small baskets and put whale meat, copper and the transparent stone Que'la (= mountain crystal, used by shamans to hurt their enemies) in each one. When all the baskets were full, they flew to Awlky'enoq and sat down on an emblem pole. There the chief discovered that during his absence another man had married his wife. He became angry, flew down and killed him. Then the birds took off their feathers and went into the house. He shook the baskets and immediately a large whale lay on the shore. There were many coppers in the house and many stones (Que'la). Then the people knew that their chief had returned 12 Häntl'ekunas.  Once upon a time there was a strong, skilled hunter who could see very clearly. He knew how to hunt mountain goats and harpoon seals. When he caught game


Page 465

 he used to cut it open with shell knives. The blood always splashed on his face. He didn't pay any attention to it, but eventually he went blind as a result. He became very poor and had nothing for his wife and children to eat. He made them dig roots and they lived off them.  One morning, his wife saw a large bear across the river. She told her husband, gave him a bow and arrows and aimed the arrow for him.  Then she told him to shoot, and he hit the bear and killed it. But his wife said, "You missed." She wanted the meat for herself. She then went over, pulled the bear off and roasted it unnoticed.  She gave it to her children, but forbade them to give anything to her Yater.  She gave each child four pieces. But one of the children, a boy, hid three pieces under his arm and brought them to his father. He said, "This is from what you killed. Take and eat!" The old man asked: "So I did kill him, didn't I?" "Yes, and mother and my brothers are eating now," said the boy. Then Häntl'ekunas became very sad. He said to his son, "If you have courage enough, take me to the mountain where they used to make the blind see." The boy took his father by the hand and led him up. The old man also carried a stick with which he felt his way along the ground so as not to miss the path. There was a lake at the top of the mountain. They stopped there and Häntl'ekunas sent his son back home and told him to expect him after four days. He then swam in the lake and prayed to the goose (Qä'oe): "I am unhappy. I am blind and my relatives have no pity on me. Have mercy on me!" Then he heard the goose approaching. She said: "Come! I want to make you happy. Sit on my back! I will dive with you and you will regain your sight. We have to stay down for a long time, otherwise you won't get well. So try to hold out for a long time. When you can no longer hold your breath, scratch me and I will surface again."  With that, she dived. After a short time, Häntl'ekunas ran out of breath and scratched the goose. She said: "You must be able to endure it longer! Press your mouth firmly into my feathers, then you will be able to endure it longer."  They dived again. After a while, Häntl'ekunas scratched the goose, and when it emerged, he could see a faint glimmer of light. They dived a third time. When they reappeared, his eyes were as good as before. The goose asked him: "Can you see properly now?" He replied: "Not quite as good as before," because he wished he could see even better. So the goose dived with him again, and now his eyes were even better than they had ever been. He now went home.  His wife had just gone out. Then he saw the skin of the bear he had shot stretched out to dry in front of the door. He was furious and shot his wife and sons, except the youngest, who had brought him meat when they came home.  He then left his home and wandered into the land of the Heiltsuk*.  There he met many people. One girl, who had many brothers, became very fond of him and he lived with her without marrying her. Her brothers were angry about this and decided to kill him. One day, they asked him to go sea lion hunting with them. They sailed together to a cliff far out at sea, which was difficult to access as the seabed around it was covered in seaweed. The boats could not get very close. So they jumped into the water and swam to the island of Berl. Authropol. Society 1893. 30


Page 466

 and killed the sea lions with clubs. They then cut them up and began to load the boat by swimming from the island to the boat and carrying the meat into it. When Häntl'ekunas was busy on the island preparing a load of meat, the brothers left and left him alone. Only the youngest took pity on him and threw him a fur coat. Then Häntl'ekunas was saddened and thought he had no choice but to die. He sat down on the highest point of the cliff and wrapped himself in his blanket. Then he heard a delicate voice calling his name. He looked up but saw no one. He heard the same voice four times and on the fourth time he saw a little man. He then said: "My chief asks you to come to him." Häntl'ekunas asked for the name of the chief, who was called Amä'gyitläsela (= bird excrement). He followed the little one, who led him into a cave where there was a house. Häntl'ekunas now knew that he was with the chief of the sea lions. He felt cold and sat down close to the fire. The chief entertained him and promised to send him back to his homeland. He sent to Seagull to borrow their boat, but the people said it was too slow. He sent to Yogel Mä'tsene, but the people said: "His boat hits the rocks too often and breaks;" and he sent to Goose, but the people said her boat went too deep. Finally he sent to the sea lion NE'mslramisila (= the very first) and borrowed his boat: a sea lion skin. They tied Häntl'ekunas into it and summoned the west wind, which quickly carried him home. When he came ashore, he untied the sack, climbed out and hid it in the forest. In the evening he went to his beloved.  She now had a child and was always crying for him. Nobody cared about her except her youngest brother. So Häntl'ekunas killed all her brothers.  He only spared the youngest. Then he fled with his wife. The Heiltsuk' pursued him. But he hid unnoticed in the forest and his pursuers passed him by without finding him. Then he went to Ts'ä'koala (in Rivers Inlet), where he stayed for a few days. On the second day of his stay, he took his dog into the boat and went to a steep mountain. He climbed up and found many mountain goats in a cave that was right next to a precipice. He set fire to his cedar bast cloak and threw it into the cave to drive the goats out. As soon as they came out of the cave, he pushed them into the abyss. Then he went back home and said to the people: "Let's go and dig roots!" He did not say that he had killed many mountain goats. He led the people to the chasm where all the mountain goats were lying. On the way they found two in the sea, and the people in the boats were arguing about who should have them. Then he said: "Stop arguing. We'll soon find lots of mountain goats." They then loaded the boats with his booty and took them home.  13 The thread game.  Once upon a time there were many children who played at making figures out of threads on their fingers. The moon man saw this. He came down to them and said, "It is not good that you should do nothing but play the thread game. Better go and catch fish!" Then he sang, "Many fish are here," and immediately shoals of herring came swimming up and caught the children.  14th Häok'häok".  A young man named K-'ö'mkJlikya once went into the forest to fetch cedar bark. There the spirit Häok'häok' scented him. He realized that the


Page 467

 young man was pure and good, and therefore rushed at him to rob him.  When K-'ö'mkTlikya heard the spirit approaching in the shape of a huge crane, he almost lost his breath with fear. He hoped to overcome his fear by smoking a pipe, but it was in vain. He lost consciousness and lay there as if dead. The Hä'k'häok- approached and while the young man lay there unconscious, he instilled his spirit into him.  When K-'ö'mkilikya did not return, his friends went into the forest to look for him. At last they found him lying there as if dead. They poured water on his face, but he did not wake up. So they carried him to the village and took him to his Yater. When he saw him lying dead, his heart was very sad. Soon, however, he realized that there was still a little breath left in him, and he summoned the sick man and asked him to restore his son. He comforted the Yater and ordered him to clean his house and sprinkle it with sand so that the former ground would no longer be walked on. He took the young man out into the forest and stayed there for four days. Then he returned. After another four days, K-'ö'mkTlikya also returned. However, the shaman had now given him the name K'oätlk'oä'oe.  He now sang of the Hä'ok'häok' and suddenly jumped up to eat his father, who was sitting on the other side of the fire. He had the Hä'mats'a's Cederbastring on his head. It slipped off and fell straight over his mouth, so that instead of biting his yater, he bit a piece out of the ring. The people did not know what to do to calm him down. Then his grandfather took a large black coat and wrapped it around his head. He also tore it with his teeth. Then the people tied a rope around his mouth, but in vain! he tore it. Then his father called all the neighbors to help, but no one could restrain him. Everyone fled from the house in fear. They heard him singing inside and peered through the cracks and knotholes in the walls to see what he was up to. Then they saw him climb up the posts of the house and open the roof. He wanted to chase the people. So they put two men on guard at the door and others held the roof so that he could not escape. Then they went inside and threw a bearskin over him. Under it he crawled around on the ground and was so slippery that no one could catch him. In the evening he became quiet and lay so still that people didn't know whether he was awake or asleep.  They made a jacket out of cedar bast in order to catch him in it and get hold of him. But when they tried to put it on him, he jumped out of it and was as wild as before. On the island of Nalkuitqoi'oas (Mackyol Island), women were busy cutting up salmon. He caught a whiff of them and in his rage jumped into the water to eat them. But the women jumped into their boat and went out to sea when they saw him coming.  At last K'oätlkoä'oe came to himself again and said to his father, "If I fall into a rage again, don't put up a fight and I won't harm you." After a short time, he fell into a frenzy again. He lay flat on the ground, his face turned downwards. The neighbors threw a net of cedar bast over him to catch him, and sometimes they managed to put their foot on his neck, but again and again he eluded them. They held him by his long hair, which they twisted around their hands, but he still escaped and no one knew where he had gone. He wandered around the forest and the village and bit anyone he came across. When he was 30*


Page 468

 When he regained consciousness, he asked his father to boil Olachen oil and pour it into him if he had another seizure. Then he would come to. Once, when he fell into one of his raptures again, he sensed a boat that had collected shells but was still far away. He ran to the beach and when the boat landed, he devoured all the shells in it. Then he became calm again.  (This legend is depicted in the dance Tsä'elca. A woman dances the Häok' häok', the son of a powerful chieftain the K-'o'mkilikya. The dance belongs to the Hämats'a customs).  XXI Legends of the Heiltsuk-.  1. the legend of the ravens.  (1) We find here the same legend of the liberation of the sun by the raven which is found among the more northern peoples. The name of the chief's daughter is Ky'e'tetl.  2. long ago an old chief possessed the fresh water. The raven decided to steal it. He tied a tube of sea lion intestines around his neck and hid it under his cloak. He flew to the chief's house and took on the form of an old man. He entered and asked the chief and his wife for food and drink, pretending to be half-starved and thirsty. The chief granted his request and told his wife to give him fish and berries. After the guest had eaten, he let him go to the bucket in which he kept the water and drink. The raven put the bucket on. But instead of drinking, he poured the water into the hose. As he did not stop drinking, the chief called out: "What are you doing?  Where are you leaving all the water?" But the raven did not stop until he had emptied the bucket completely. Then he took on his true form and flew away, shouting: "K ä, k'ä!" Then the woman called out: "So the raven has come and stolen our water!" The raven flew over the whole world and dropped water everywhere, a lot in one place and a little in another. That is why there are big and small rivers.  3) Yäeqoe'ok'oa is a giant fish that lives in the depths of the ocean and guards the waters of the sea. When it approaches the land, the water rises.  4) Once Yäeqoe'ok'oa caused the sea to recede and for four days the seabed was dry. The raven went to the sea with his sister HalHa' (name jackdaw as human) and they gathered fish. The raven collected all kinds of beautiful-looking fish, but Haina' only caught "black cod", although her brother advised her not to pick up such ugly fish. When the water returned after four days, they went ashore and cooked their fish. When the raven tried his fish, he found that they were very dry, while his sister's were dripping with fat. So he began to eat Haliia's fish, although she forbade him and told him to eat his own fish. At last he ate everything his sister had caught and flew away. Then she wept. 5 The raven had a child, named Kyl'ötl, who had shining white skin and beautiful long hair (p. 447). One day the two went out together to gather wood on an island. The raven went into the forest to collect wood while Kyi'ötl stayed in the boat. Suddenly the eagle Kani'sltsua swooped down


Page 469

 When the raven returned and could no longer find his child, he was very sad and began to cry. He asked the oarsmen and rowers: "Don't you know where my child is?" They could not answer. He asked all the parts of the boat, and at last the beak said, "Kani'sltsua has stolen her."  He went for four days looking for his daughter and cried constantly. Then suddenly Kyl'ötl came back. She stepped behind her father and called him. He turned around, but did not recognize her, for her hair had fallen out. He said: "Don't hold me for the best. I know that my child is dead. Your face is not my daughter's face; your hair is not long like my daughter's." She replied: "Yes, it is me, father! I was so changed up there in heaven. There is always a strong wind there, and it has changed me so much.  If you don't recognize me now and take me home, I will return to heaven and never come back." The raven did not answer.  Then Kyi'ötl flew back to heaven and only then did the raven recognize her. For four days, his daughter had begged him in vain to recognize her.  Since then, people have not returned to earth once they have died.  6 In the beginning, people did not know how to build boats. The raven was the first to practise the art. When he was busy building his boat, all the people came to watch him. Once the deer came too. The raven said: "Come closer, friend! Sit close to me so that you can see what I'm doing." He then asked: "Tell me at what time of year you have the most fat?" The stag replied: "When the grass is long, I am at my fattest. I am fattest now." So the raven beat him to death with his hammer. Then he made a big fire just under the branches of a fallen tree next to which he was sitting, threw stones into it and cooked the deer. He then speared pieces of fat on a stick, leaned back comfortably and began to eat. He said to the tree: "Look, you're not getting any of the deer I'm eating here." He soon became tired and fell asleep. As he lay there, the tree rolled onto the deer so that its branches caught hold of it and ate it. When the raven woke up, the whole stag had disappeared.  (7) The raven once gave a feast and made Mahai'us (the raccoon's human name) dance and sing at the feast. As he sang, the raven called out, "Make your song longer! Make it longer!" Mahai'us became angry at this. The raven then took ashes and smeared them on his forehead. That is why the raccoon is gray. 8) The squirrel once gave a feast. He defecated in a bowl and turned the excrement into berries with which he fed his guests. He sent two men to the chief, the raven, to invite him too. The raven replied: "I'll be right there. I just want to relieve myself at that headland first." He went and defecated on a plank. Then he said to his excrement: "After a short time, shout: 'Ho, ho! Your enemies are coming and want to kill you." Then he went into the squirrel's house, where they were already eating. After a short time, one of the guests went outside and heard a voice shouting: "Hark, hark, your enemies are coming to kill you." He quickly ran back into the house and called everyone out. They came and while the house was empty, the raven ate all the berries. But an old woman had stayed in the house without him knowing, and she called the squirrel: "Come, come! The raven has all your berries


Page 470

 eaten." The raven said to her: "Be quiet, I will give you plenty to eat too." But as she continued to scream, he flew away.  9) The raven was once sitting on the top of a mountain on the Bella Coola River and saw many half-humans (i.e. half-animals, half-humans) in the valley. Among them he saw a woman he liked. Her name was Hai'atlilak's. So he flew down and married her. They lived together for a while, but as she had no children, he left her again. He moved to the land of the Heiltsuk' and married Ts'ö'mk lak s'), with whom he fathered many children. Their eldest son was Ia'kis. He painted some rocks near G'alts (Bella Bella) with red paint and said: "When food is plentiful, the color should always be bright red; when scarcity threatens, it should appear dull." And even today you can see from the color whether the year will be good or bad.  10 The raven sat on the "top of a tree at the mouth of the Skeena, the eagle Kyä'loyak'ame (= the very first) a little below him. One day the latter flew up and sat above the raven. The raven became angry and flew away. He finally came to Ky'itnEqk' in the land of Bilqula, where Wekyöyö'is and his wife AeqeläVa lived, who always prayed to the raven.  He settled there.  2. the mink.  Gyälastä'kome was a boy who lived alone with his mother in a cottage. One day he asked his mother if he had no father. She said that his father was far away. Then Gyälastä'kome began to cry and shout: "I want to find my father." A woman who heard him crying gave him two stone axes and he hid them in the arm pits. A man, Nam Hantle'k' (= the archer), gave him a bow and arrows. Gyälastä'kome shot an arrow into the sky. It got stuck in the vault of heaven. He shot a second one, which hit the notch of the first, and so he continued until a chain was formed that reached down from heaven to earth. He shook it and found that it was strong enough to carry him. Then he climbed up. when he reached heaven, he met his stepmother at the door of her house and said, "Have you come at last?" "Yes," replied Gyälastä'kome, "I s my father." "Good, then wait here," she replied, "he will return today. He may no longer carry the light of day. You take his place!" In the evening the sun came home, Gyälastä'kome's father was happy to see his son and told him to carry the sun in his place. He gave him his clothes and his ornaments and told him not to go too fast the next morning, otherwise the light would burn and the sea would dry up. But Gyälastä'kome was disobedient. He became impatient, began to run, and it became so hot on earth that the rocks burst and the sea began to dry up. The shells at the bottom of the sea turned black. Then his father seized him and brought him down to earth, shouting: "You are good for nothing, become a mink. Henceforth men shall hunt you."  3. wä'walis.  Close to G'alts (Bella Bella) are two bays on a small island, called Wä'walitsös and Qune's, separated only by a headland. An 1) Many songs refer to the raven and this woman.


Page 471

 A chief named Wa'walis lived in the first, and Mak'oa'ns lived in the second. Wa'walis used to go out with his slave to hunt seals, and he was a very successful hunter. Once, when he was hunting, Mak'oa'ns' son seduced his wife, and from that moment on he felt that his luck had run out. He suspected that his wife was unfaithful to him, but wanted to make sure that his suspicions were well-founded, so he returned home in the evening. He crept unnoticed into the house and into his wife's room. There he listened at the wall and heard that his wife was talking to a man. He crept out again, sharpened his knife and returned at midnight. He knocked carefully on the wall to make sure they were asleep, but he heard the wife say, "There's a mouse." After a while, he knocked on the wall again, but nothing stirred. Then he crept into the house and into the room, felt for the man's head, seized it by the skull and cut it off. Then he ran to the beach, jumped into his boat and hurried away.  After a short time, the woman felt that her bed was wet. She said to her mother: "My child has wet the bed. Take it a little." But when she looked around, she noticed that her bed was full of blood and that her son's head had been cut off. She cried out in horror. Mak'oa'n's son used to sit on a smooth rock at night and look towards the east when the sun rose. He always sat there wrapped in his cloak, his headless hat on his head. The woman carried the headless corpse to the rock, wrapped it in his coat and put his hat on so that it looked as if he was sleeping there.  The next morning, Mäk-oa'ns' wife was surprised that her son had not come to breakfast. When noon came and he had not yet arrived, she sent her youngest son to the rock to wake him up. The boy went there and shook his brother four times: "Get up! We've been eating for a long time!"  When he didn't move, he ran back to his mother and said, "I can't wake my brother." The mother replied: "If he doesn't want to get up, take his hat off." The little boy ran back, took off his hat and saw that his brother had no head. He cried out loudly, ran down to the beach and shouted: "My brother has lost his head." When the people heard this, they stopped him and said, "Don't say such things!" and sent two men out to see what was the matter. They found the body and carried it back to the house.  After some time, Wa'walis returned from the hunt as if nothing had happened. He headed for the headland. People called out to him from afar: "Wa'walis! Don't lift your oars high into the air, for our chief's son has been killed." Wa'walis acted as if he heard nothing. His wife was very fond of mountain goat fat and seal heads. He brought her a basket full of heads in the boat, went up to the house and said to her: "Go down to the boat and take from the basket what you like so much." Prau brought the basket into the house, took out a seal's head and asked: "Is this it?" "No," Wa'walis replied, "it's at the bottom." Then she found the head of her boar. She screamed out in horror. But Wa'walis took the head and hit her with it, saying: "Take it! Why are you afraid of him? You love him so much!" He beat her to death. Then he cut open her belly and took out her kidneys, which he hung outside the door. Every time the new moon came, they bled; that's why women menstruate.


Page 472

 Wä'walis had three sisters who were married to some people in Mäk'oaW village. One day, he gave them some rich yorrahs and went to eat there with his three cousins. As they were eating, they were suddenly attacked and killed by Mäk-oa'ns' people. The murderers threw their bodies on the beach. His three sisters wept. They left their husbands, went down to the beach and mourned the dead. They dug a hole to bury the bodies, and when they were tired of digging, they sat down again and wept. When night fell, the sisters lay down to sleep beside the dead. But the youngest, who was very beautiful, could not sleep and only closed her eyes. Once, when she blinked a little, she saw a man from the moon coming straight down to her. He had very white skin and snow-white hair. He was the son of the moon.  He stepped up to her and nudged her: "Get up!" he said. She obeyed. "What are you doing here? Why are you crying?" he continued. Then the young woman said, "We are very unhappy. People have killed our brother and our friends. We want to be dead with them." "I know it," replied the son of the moon. "I have seen that you are unhappy. Now stop crying and wipe the blood from your face"').  He stroked her face with his hand, which immediately became beautiful and white.  He carried a bucket filled with water of life in his right hand, the bringer of death (iäHs'oä'm) in his left. He woke her sisters and had them dig the corpses out of the ground again. Then he poured some of the water of life into the mouths of the dead and blew on them four times. Then they arose and were alive again. He said: "I am now going back to my father, the moon. Give me your youngest sister. She shall stay with me for four days, then I will send her back to you." And he gave Wä'walis a small box, no longer than a finger, full of the Water of Life and the Death Bringer and taught him how to use them. If he poured the water of life into the mouth of a sick person, he would be healed. If he opened the box containing the bringer of death against his enemies, they would die. But he warned him not to look into the box himself. Then he said: "When you pray to the moon, do not look at it, but look down to the earth." -He then placed the youngest sister on his feet and flew with her towards the sky, circling higher and higher like an eagle. Then Wä'walis, his cousins and his sisters prayed to the moon, looking down to the earth.  Mäk'oans wanted to kill all of Wä'walis' relatives. He summoned all the animals and waged war on him. Then Wä'walis opened the box that contained the Deathbringer, and all his enemies died. But he revived his friends who had fallen in battle with the water of life. Mäkoa'ns now summoned the giant fish Yaeqoe'ok'oa (p. 468) to make the sea rise. So Wä'walis dug a trench around his house, sharpened his knife and coated it with poison. When the water rose to the edge of the ditch, he cut along the edge with his knife and immediately Yaeqoe'ok-oa had to retreat from the shore and the water fell again. Yaeqoe'koa tried to drown him six times, but he could not defeat Wä'walis. Then Mäk-oa'ns gave up his attempts to kill him.  1) When a close relative dies, the women cut their foreheads.

 The sister, whom the moon man had taken with him to heaven, stayed away for four years, which only seemed like days to her. She once sat on her bed and thought of her siblings. Then her husband said, "Why are you sad? Do you think your sisters are so far away? Look down, they are very close." So he pulled the pillow aside and made her look down. She now saw the whole world. Her husband prepared a ship (not a boat), let her board it and sent her back to her home. One morning, the siblings heard a great noise and saw a ship coming in which their sister was sitting. She had become very beautiful. Her skin was snow-white, and her hair was long and white, like that of the moon man. They unloaded the ship, which was full of riches. The moon man had also given her a drum. Wä'walis was delighted. He gave a great feast, during which his sister told him about the land in the moon. It never gets dark there, and the people learned that the dead live there.  Mäk'oa'ns was so ashamed that he left for Awiky'enoq. He took his son's body with him, which was turned into a rock in the shape of a crouching man without a head. The head is not far away. It is a stone the size of a hut.  4 Masmasalä'niq.  A long time ago, two brothers and their sister lived in Rivers Inlet. They had a dog. At that time there were no fish and people were always in need. The brothers made a small fish trap and put it in a small stream where their house stood. A small fish came and caught itself in it. The brothers saw it and took it out of the trap. The girl then cut it open, dried it and put it in a box. The following morning, a larger fish was caught in the trap, which the girl also prepared. On the third day came an even bigger fish and on the fourth, finally, a salmon. One night the dog barked and the siblings could not sleep. The girl hit the dog with a stick and said: "What do you want? You'd better make the river bigger so that we can catch more fish."  The dog ran out of the house, and when they went outside the next morning, they saw a large river, which they called Ky'e'tet. They made big salmon weirs and caught so many fish that their house was completely full. The girl hung them on the rafters to dry. When the eldest brother went to check on the fish in the morning, he found that they had all disappeared. But he didn't know who the thief was. On three consecutive days, he found his fish missing each time. So he said to his brothers and sisters: "Go to sleep! I want to keep watch over the fish today." He took his bow and arrows and hid. At midnight he saw Masmasalä'niq coming, a large man without a head whose eyes were on either side of his chest. He shot him four times, but he nevertheless took the salmon and ran away.  The young man pursued him over three mountains and through three valleys. At last he saw Masmasalä'niq's house standing on a plain by a lake. Masmas lä'niq ran inside. The young man had shot him many times on the way, but had not been able to kill him.  He sat down on the shore of the lake and soon heard rattling and drumming in the house. Masmasalä'niq felt very ill and wanted to lie down, but could not because his body was full of arrows. No one knew what was wrong with him, however, because the arrows were invisible to him and his people. There


Page 474

 they had summoned all of the necromancers together to heal him. But none of them succeeded. After some time, a man came out of the house and, when he saw the stranger sitting on the bank, he asked him: "Are you a necromancer?"  When the man replied in the affirmative, he asked him: "0 come and heal our chief."  He went into the house and Masmasaläniq promised him his daughter as a reward. The young man saw her sitting upstairs in the house and he liked her very much. So he put on his summoner's jewelry and pulled the arrows out of Masma salä'niqs' body unnoticed. He pulled them twice and removed them all. Then Masma salä'niqs' daughter was given to him in marriage. The chief invited him to stay for four days. But the four days were actually four years. They had children together and at the end of the time the woman said: "Now let us go to your homeland. Go to that mountain! There are big cedars there. Cut one down and build a boat." He obeyed. Sometimes he thought: "How will the boat get down to the sea? There's no water here." Finally, he asked his wife. She said: "Don't worry about it. You'll find out when the boat is ready." When the boat was ready, she took a small box and asked her friends to bring her food. So they did and she put everything in the little box. She put enough food to fill a whole house in it. Then she and her husband went to the boat. She sat down in the front part, made her husband sit down in the back part and looked at the mountain top. Then she began to urinate, and her urine became a great river. Then she allowed her husband to turn around. She showed him the river and said, "We will go this way." Then he had to pull his cloak over his head, as he was not supposed to see them go ahead. The woman clapped her hands on the outside of the boat. Then the painting began to row. They soon reached his home and she had her husband take the blanket off his face again. He went to the shore and saw that a pair of beams were all that was left of his house, and that his brothers and sisters were dead. He began to weep, but his wife said, "Don't cry! Take my box and my mat. Collect the bones of your brothers and sisters and your dog and cover them with the mat." When he had done her bidding, she took her comb and scratched the mat four times. Then the siblings and the dog got up, stretched and rubbed their eyes as if they had been asleep. When they left Masmasalä'niqs' land, the wife warned her husband: "Don't ever scold our child, otherwise I will get angry and do something very bad for us." They lived happily and in peace for many years.  Once, however, the child disturbed the man at work and he scolded him. As soon as the woman heard this, she took the child, jumped into the boat with him, folded her hands on the outside of the boat and it carried her away.  5 K ömö'k'oa (= the rich man).  Four young men went out in a boat to hunt seals. They stayed out overnight and dropped anchor at the foot of a mountain. The stone fell straight onto the roof of K-ömö k'oa's house. He sent his slave, the shark, to see who was there. He climbed up the anchor rope and made a noise near the boat to scare the people away.  The four men were kept awake by the noise. So they caught the shark, cut off its fins and threw it back into the water. He screamed, swam back to K-ömö'k-oa and shouted: "Four people are up there and have mutilated me like this." K-ömö'k-oa said, "We want to get them down when


Page 475

 They slept soundly, and he did as he had said. Soon one of the men woke up and immediately realized that he was in an unknown land. He thought he was dreaming and bit his hand to wake up. Then he woke the others and they soon discovered that they were just outside Körnö'k'oa's house. He invited them to come in. He sat them down next to him and said, "You shall stay with me for four days and you shall become my brothers." Then he invited all the people to a great feast. But an old woman, the mouse, warned the young people not to eat what K'ömö'k'oa gave them, otherwise they would never return to the upper world. And she warned them about the sea monster Hä'nak'atse. Then two of the men went out and coated their boat with a magic substance so that Hä'nak'atse could not swallow it up. K'ömö'k'oa asked his guests, "Don't you have any mountain goat fat? " They gave him a little. K'ömö'k'oa divided it into four pieces and threw it into the four corners of the house, which were immediately filled with mountain goat fat. Then they heard the noise of the coming guests. All the fish came and also the chief Yäeqoe'ok'oa, who makes the tides, and the house filled with water. A great whirl arose which almost overturned the boat, and the door to K'ö mök-oa's room opened and closed like a maw, and all the water slurped in. When the boat approached the door, the men threw poison into the water and so they escaped happily. The door was the monster Hä'nak'atse.  At last the men fell asleep, and when they awoke, they found themselves back on the surface of the water. K'ömö'k'oa had had them brought back by three fin whales who filled their boat with seals. They thought they had only been with K'ömö'k'oa for four days, but it had actually been four years.  Their anchor stone and anchor rope were completely overgrown with seaweed. They took it with them to the shore and that is where all the seaweed came from. 6 The mountain lion.  Once upon a time there was a man from the tribe of K'ök'aitq. He lived with his wife and his brother. He was a good mountain goat hunter. His wife always fasted while he was hunting and only chewed resin, so he was always lucky. Once the brothers went hunting and stayed away for five days. There was a tree near the house from which the wife always took her resin.  She went there again. But the mountain lion lay in wait for her there and killed her. He then put on her skin and went into the house in the form of the woman. When the man returned home, his wife had eaten everything he had brought home. The man was very surprised that his wife had suddenly become so voracious. They went to sleep, but at midnight the mountain lion slipped out of the woman's skin and ran away. Then the man knew what had happened. He followed the mountain lion and found his wife's bones under the tree. He killed the mountain lion and then wept over the bones. Then an old woman, the mouse, who had been watching him, said: "Don't cry any more! I will bring her back to life." She went to the hot springs of Ek'a and washed the bones with the water. The woman came back to life. The man was now very happy. He went hunting again. One day, however, he stayed away and his wife waited in vain for him to return. So she sent her brother-in-law out to look for him. He did not return either. The wife could no longer sleep from fear and excitement and finally went out herself to look for her husband. She took two pieces of wood coated with poison with her. As she climbed up the mountain, she came across a fallen tree.


Page 476

 tree. She was about to bend down to crawl under it when she saw a house. In it, her husband and brother-in-law were sitting with a woman. She was delighted and asked: "Why don't you come back to me?" They replied: "This woman and her yater are keeping us here by force." She hid herself until it got dark. She saw how the chief offered the men human eyes to eat, but that they only pretended to eat, while in reality they hid their eyes under their cloaks. The mouse had advised them to do this. After the meal, the chief went to sleep. "When he slept, his head always fell off. The woman grabbed him and applied poison to his neck four times. The head and body could not grow back together and the chief died. The mountain lion had been the slave of this chief.  7 K'ömä nukula') and G"'ä'g-'apala'qsEm-).  The first people in G"'äpa, a village of the K'ök'aitq, were K'ömänu kula and his sister G-'ä'g-'apala'qsEm. They descended from heaven and with them came two houses full of riches and many pipes to Tse tsäek-a3). A pole decorated with an eagle's face stood in front of the house and a large roof, which always made noise, covered the chimney. The inside of the house was decorated with representations of the bird äqaqone'. The room doors depicted the sea monster Hä'nak-atse, which always devoured boats.  Game and fish came to K'omä'nukula of their own accord, and many logs of driftwood swam up by themselves. When they reached the shore, they stood up and became human beings. Even today the chiefs of the K'ök'aitq in G''äpa use the same carvings with which K'ömänukula's house was decorated.  G,'ä/g-'apa]a'qsEm had a daughter. She gave her the dance Tle'Htem'is for the Tsetsä'ek'a. Then the girl had to stay hidden in her room for a long time, which was partitioned off for this purpose. No one knew what happened inside. G''ä'g'apala'qsEm made her a fire in it, and the girl lay down and slept. Then she saw two beings, consisting only of heads, standing up next to the fire. They were called Qä'uk'umä'las. Then she began to tremble at the sight of the spirits, who made her Tlökoa'la4) and gave her the dance K'i'nlrla'tla.  8 Baqbakuälanosl'uae (= the one who always ate human flesh at the mouth of the river). A man named Nöak'au'a (= the wise) had two sons. They used to go hunting mountain goats. One day they saw a house on a mountain from which beautiful smoke was rising. They went inside and met a woman and her child. They told her to wait until her husband returned, and when they sat down, one of the brothers hurt his foot. The boy licked the blood eagerly. The brothers were now afraid and fled. Then the woman called her husband Baqbakuälanusl'oae: "Two men were here and escaped.  They are good fodder." The fugitives heard a great noise and many whistles 1) The rich man.  2) The G-'ä'pa woman.  3) The winter dance; literally: the secrets.  4) The word Tlök'oa'la is hard to translate. It means both to find something unexpected and to gain supernatural power through contact with spirits.


Page 477

 behind them and saw* that BaqbakuälanusT'oae was hot on their heels. So they threw a stone they were carrying behind them, struck the beat and sang, and it was turned into a mountain. When BaqbakuälanusT'uae had gone around the mountain and was approaching again, they broke their arrows and threw them behind them. They were transformed into a dense forest. When their pursuer approached again, they threw their comb behind them and turned it into a "crabapple" thicket. At last they poured out water behind them, which turned into a lake. They reached their father's house. They called out to their father from afar: "Open the door! Baqbakuälanusl uae is hot on our heels and wants to eat us." Noak'aua let them in and made a large hole, poured water into it and laid planks over it. When the man-eater came, he invited him to sit down and showed him a place just above the pit. He promised him the meat of his sons. Suddenly he had the planks pulled away. Baqbakuälanusl uae fell into the pit, they threw red-hot stones into it and cooked him. They burned him to ashes, blew them into the air and turned them into mosquitoes. (See a more complete form of the legend in the previous section.) - A chief had two wives. One of them once became angry, threw all her things out of the house and ran into the mountains. The chief and his other wife went after her. When they got tired, they sat down and were all turned into stones there. You can still see the man, the women and all their boxes and things today.  - Tlä'tla is a woman who carries a basket on her back in which she steals children. (See legends of the Awiky'enoq.) - The stag was called Tlek'k'ume' and Asanöiste'sela (= torch [anö'J träger), because he stole the fire by means of wood tied to his tail. - (20) Hr. Hermann Graf v. Schweinitz und Krain discusses his experiences with the Wanyamwesi, Wassukuma, Wasiba and Wakara, presenting numerous ethnographic objects.  I have the honor of presenting to the Society a number of decorative objects, basketry and woodwork, mainly from the East African peoples of the Wanyamwesi, Wassukuma, Wasiba and Wakara.  I do not include the Wassukuma among the Wanyamwesi peoples, as is usually done on the maps of East Africa; the two ethnic groups are too different and the Wassukuma do not call themselves Wanyamwesi.  The Wanyamwesi people live in the area south of Lake Victoria, east of Lake Tanganika, but without touching either of these two lakes. It consists of a large number of mostly powerful sultanates, the most important of which is Unianjembe. They also include the well-known Urambo and P Reicherd's sultanate of Igunda.  The Wanyamwesi people have changed extraordinarily in the last few decades since the invasion of the Arabs. The sedentary people have become a largely migratory carrier and trading people, whose old Negro culture, if I may be so bold as to use the word culture in this sense


Page 478

 The Wanyamwesi, who had learned to use their own culture, suffered greatly in the encounter with the Arab culture, but without the Arab culture having penetrated. The Wanyamwesi only learned luxury and the pursuit of profit from the Arabs, and that was enough to put the people on the slippery slope they are on today.  While our first travelers to Africa from the Wanyamwesi country brought us not insignificant products of local industry, today there is hardly anything of note to be found in that country. Thus the old tool industry, which the Wanyamwesi, like the Waganda, used to operate, has disappeared and even in the objects of daily use one can immediately recognize the decline when comparing those collected by the older travellers to Africa with those available today.  The Mnyamwesi has seen too many foreign things, he looks down on his own products with contempt and therefore no longer takes the same care in the manufacture of his products.  The bracelets that I collected in Unyamwesi (see Fig. 1 and '2) characterize the current position of the people in the manner described. Figure 1. figure 2. copper and brass clasps, Unyanvwesi. */> ('er natural size. consist of metal - mostly the imported metal, i.e. their money - are of the greatest simplicity and often without any trace of ornamentation. In many cases they are merely a showy display of money without any aesthetic purpose.  It is often surprising to see the different ways in which African peoples develop. The Wanyamwesi and Wassukuma peoples are two nations that have developed so differently despite their proximity. In the case of these two, the reason is obvious: after all, it was only the influence of vegetation conditions on their character. The Unyamwesi country is covered with thick forests and the soil is relatively fertile.  The easily obtainable wood made it possible for the Wanyamwesi to build dwellings of great strength. The great sultans of the country have built fortress-like residences that can be considered impregnable against their native neighbors. These fortified places gave the people great security and, as the country provided them with everything they needed for their lives in abundance, they were able to enjoy a comfortable rest. They had no need to be suspicious of strangers and always welcomed them in a friendly manner.  When the Arabs moved their trading base of operations from the coast to the interior, no more favorable territory could have been found for them than Unyam wesi; in the most powerful of the Wanyamwesi sultanates - Unianjembe - they were warmly welcomed and founded Tabora. In their constantly peaceful dealings with the natives, they soon gained influence over these peoples.


Page 479

 Ussukuma Land, which borders Unyamwesi Land to the north and touches Lake Victoria on the eastern shore of the Ukumbi Gulf and the Speke Gulf, does not have the mighty forests of Unyamwesi. On the contrary! Here you can walk for days without seeing a tree or even a bush. It was therefore quite impossible for the Wassukuma to build such permanent places as the Wanyam wesi. With a few poles, often brought from far away, they built scanty huts whose only protection was provided by euphorbia (spurge) hedges.  What these dwellings lost in solidity, the people had to replace with their personal qualities. They had to be constantly on their guard against their neighbors and could not rest in peace. Thus they became or remained a warlike and suspicious people who did not like strangers. This was therefore the place where even in the peaceful times before the beginning of European rule, wars often had to be waged by the old travelers to Africa. However, the natives knew how to resist the influx of foreigners, especially the Arabs. Their old Negro culture did not encounter any foreign culture and therefore did not suffer.  Beautiful industrial products can still be found here today. Almost all the baskets and wooden vessels (see Figs. 3-12) shown here were collected in this country.  Figure 3. '/, Figure 4. V12 Figure B. "/, Waterproof, woven vessels from Ussuktima, yellow and black patterned.  The wickerwork, which is also used to store the native beer and is therefore watertight, shows that this branch of their industry is by no means on a low level, and the richness of form and the abundance of beautiful ornamentation indicate a sense of beauty that has not yet been corrupted. This can also be seen in the decorative objects, which must naturally be quite different from those of the Wanyamwesi. There is little trade here, so there are no bracelets made of imported metal. Here I present bracelets made of ivory and other animal teeth (cf. Fig. 12) woven like calyxes. It is precisely in the case of the most worthless bracelets that one sees the most work done on decorations from üssuküma.  The hard battles that the Wassukuma were forced to wage not only at the whim of their sultans, but also to eke out their own existence, were also experienced in other respects, however, in that they gave them a figure (i. 7e Cup woven from Ussuküma.


Page 480

 This, however, caused a reduction in the sultans' powers. However, this caused a reduction in the sultan's powers and so here one finds the peculiar phenomenon that Figure 7. Figure 8.

V4 Bracelet made of a leather strap with a pierced and decorated tooth of Phacochoerus; Ufisuktima, a people who have remained far removed from European influence, show strong democratic tendencies, whereas these usually only become apparent where European politics have brought about a disregard for the reputation of the native rulers. This strongly developed individual consciousness also made the people unsuitable for use as slaves, for example. While among the Arabs one finds members of the most diverse tribes among the slaves, one would hardly want to see Wassukuma among them.  Just as no African people will be able to resist the foreign onslaught in the long run, the Wassukuma people are also in the process of losing their old character where their conditions of existence are less harsh and the foreign onslaught is permanent. This has taken place in the areas bordering the Ukumbi Gulf. Greed has taken hold here. Large masses of porters


Page 481

 are already serving themselves here, and it will probably not be too long before the peculiarity has completely disappeared.  However, the Was sukuma carriers from the Ukumbi Gulf are still very different from the Wanyamwesi carriers. The Mnyamwesi move to the coast with their wives and children every year, often leaving whole clans, even whole villages, only to return after % to 3/t years. However, the people regard this march as an integral part of their lives, so they want to spend it comfortably. Wanyamwesi caravans therefore march very slowly and shy away from any discomfort. But what effort should they make? They can't go to the coast more than once a year. For theWassukuma, on the other hand, such a march to the coast is still a risk. He does not like to go alone, preferring to join European caravans. However, it is usually the young, adventurous people who take the risk; they usually leave their wives and children at home. For the Wassukuma, the march is an unpleasant interruption to his usual life, but he undergoes it out of greed so that he can then measure his homeland all the more. It is not uncommon for the Wassukuma bearer to feel homesick; sometimes he is so overcome by homesickness that he abandons all his earnings close to home and hurries to his own. - The Wasiba people live on the west coast of the German part of Lake Victoria. This has been described in detail by Dr. Stuhlmann and I therefore need not go into more detail. Here it was not Arab or European culture that influenced the Wasiba culture, but that of another indigenous tribe, namely the Waganda. The Wasiba have borrowed all state institutions from them and these small sultans often imitate the ruler of mighty Uganda in a ridiculous manner. But it cannot be said of Arab culture that Waganda culture has brought about a change in Wasiba culture, even if there has been no progress. In terms of industrial products, there has been no amalgamation. Even today, primitive Wasiba products can be found alongside Waganda products made in the country itself, but mostly by Waganda. Armament and clothing show the simple Wasiba culture. The spear consists of a simple pole without an iron tip and the simplicity of the shields borders on the unsc. The grass clothing, although practical, is also very simple. In contrast, I present here bracelets (Fig. 13 and 14) that are made in Usibalande and resemble the elaborate Waganda bracelets. The Wasiba have hardly learned to make such objects, even though sultans have employed Waganda workers for decades.  A peculiar piece is the tower-like belt shown in Fig. 15. It represents a lid for the pombe (beer) vessel of a U sultan, but for decorative reasons it has been given a shape that makes it almost unusable for its original purpose. Because the lid on the bottle-like vessel with an enlarged head does not find a hold in the tower-like form, the wickerwork, carried by a pagin to the sultan, looks beautiful, and that is enough. - The most interesting people I have met are the Wakar. This tribe lives on a small island in Lake Victoria north of Ukerewe and has so far managed to isolate itself completely from its surroundings.  Even the Waganda had not been able to enter the island. Dr. Baumann was the first European to land there, but was unable to negotiate the Bcrl. Anthropol. Society 1893. 81

 into circulation. I succeeded in doing so a few weeks later. I present two unnoticed photographs (Fig. 16). Even the appearance of these people shows their wild character, which does not inspire confidence, and which they also Figure 13. Figure 14.

Figure 16: Manu from Ukara with the customary small fur apron, sketch after a photograph.


Page 483

 could not deny it to me. There is no iron on the island, weapons and farming tools are made of wood. Their clothing consists of a small pell (see Fig. 16) and almost the only ornaments are woven grass rings which, when worn around the waist, also serve to fasten the hide (Fig. 17).  Figure 17: Loin cord woven from grass to fasten the fur apron.  It is interesting to note that the culture of these people, who have seen virtually nothing of the outside world, has reached a not insignificant level. Every corner of the island is utilized, there is no fallow land to be seen anywhere.  Wide paths lined with cacti criss-cross the land and artificial irrigation systems increase the carrying capacity of the soil. The presence of tree nurseries is astonishing. The Wakara grow the trees in order to multiply cattle fodder from their leaves. In East Africa, there would hardly be a Negro people who would have made it this far on their own.  In Africa, Europeans and Arabs will generally describe those peoples who are most accessible to their influences as the most developed; the others appear to them to be on such a lower level that they cannot understand the foreign culture.  However, as we have seen with these four peoples, the situation is just the opposite with regard to the indigenous culture; this is most developed where foreign influence has been least able to assert itself, and it is in decline where foreign influences have penetrated the most. - The Chairman congratulated the young researcher, who had returned home from Africa in such good health despite being seriously wounded, and thanked him for the objective and genuinely scientific way in which he had taken the opportunity offered to him to make observations and collections. It is the first time that one of our East African travelers has brought back such a large number of measurement tables and skulls - material about the actual nature of which more will be communicated immediately, but only those who have themselves been busy filling the slide boxes of domestic science in faraway places can have a full judgment of the arduous process of obtaining and securing it. Count Schweinitz, who voluntarily gave his 31*

 may rest assured that his activities in the lake region will remain unforgotten. -- The director of the ethnological museum also expresses his appreciation and thanks for the many gifts that the traveler has made to the royal collection. - (21) Mr. Virchow discusses the head measurements carried out by Count von Schweinitz on East Africans, especially in the lake region.  Count Schweinitz had already begun the first measurements in Bagamoyo in January 1892; I presented them in the meeting of March 19 of last year (Verhandl. 1892, p. 191). Since then, the conscientious traveler did not stop measuring until he was wounded. Everywhere he has gone, he has been able to overcome the resistance of the people, setting an excellent example for those helpless travelers who do not know how to convince the natives to perform such a simple operation. Porters and warriors, farmers and shepherds, even sultans and members of their families have finally allowed themselves to be measured. Thus, in the period from April 5 to September 3, 1892, a total of 79 recordings took place, of which a brief overview will be provided below.  The first 13 were made in Maharara in Ugogo, the following (nos. 14-15) in Tabora, mostly in July to the beginning of August, the others (nos. 51-61) 1 Consecutive number (number of measurement 1 leaves) fiesdilecht Age in years Head, skullthcil Face g Largest § Length g Largest i Width To 1 o mm % ES CSJ 3 '3 ~ 1 § § i-1 ^ CÖ Siz; o mm Horizontal circumference mm ; a Height A 1 (hair edge) Height B (nose root) mm g Midface § (height) 1 W a go go.  1.

Of these, 2 belonged to a tribe of the Wanyema, the Wakussu, which is notorious for its savagery and suspected of still practising man-eating; 2 others were Wangoni warriors, belonging to a Zulu tribe, which has only recently migrated from the south and is now settled between the Victoria Nyanza and the Tanganyka.  Finally, the fifth was a Mnyamwesi from Urambu.  All in all, the number of dolichocephali and hyperdolichocephali is by far predominant: 34 + 7=41 compared to 30 mesocephali. The following table gives a more detailed picture:

On the other hand, there are no chamae cephali at all in the Was inj a and Wasiba, and hypsicephaly dominates among all classes in the Wagogo.  If leptoprosopia is counted from 90.0, about a quarter of the measured East Africans are calculated as belonging to this class. Leptoprosopia dominates in the Wagogo (8 against 5) and the Watusi (3 against 1), but is completely absent in the Wanyema and Wanyamwesi. Chamaeprosopia prevails throughout the tribes described by Tom Grafen Y. Schweinitz. I give the list together with that for the nasal indices:

Paris 1885. p. 303) has classified the noses of the living races. It is thus immediately evident that the statement of this learned anthropologist, that all negroes with their nasal indices are in the group 108.9 - 89.1, is not correct. The Wangoni, for example, if one calculates a common number for the whole group (16 individuals), have a mean index of 90.5, quite apart from the fact that one of them shows 100, a second 102.3 and a third 108.8, but there are also individuals among them with 69 and 81. Indeed, for the Wagogo we only obtain a mean index of 82.4, although this includes the giant platyrrhine of an 18-year-old woman of 137.4. After all, an index of 82.4 is probably enough to make a Negro race acceptable.  It is not without interest to see how the nasal indices of the inhabitants of the Victoria Nyanza nevertheless show the otherwise recognizable convergence towards tribes with more elongated noses. Just compare the last 3 categories, which concern the tribes described by Count von Schweinitz. Of the 28 individuals measured, 9, i.e. a third, had mesorrhine noses, in stark contrast to the Wangoni, where 16 individuals had 14 platyrrhine noses.  Some details will be returned to shortly. - (22) Mr. Rud. Virchow discusses a number of Wanyamwesi and Maasai skulls.  On January 29, Count von Schweinitz wrote to me from Zanzibar as follows: "I have succeeded in collecting 8 Wanyamwesi and 19 Maasai skulls and will send them to you after my things arrive in Hamburg.


Page 496

 "I had marked the skulls with the following inscriptions:  No. 2-9, Sultanate of Massali, tribe of Wanyamwesi, about 3° 40' south lat. and 33° 30' east long. v. Gr. 1890 slain by Wangoni.

"I collected Nos. 2-9 on the battlefield. I was assured by various sources that none of the victorious Wangoni had fallen in the battle. But if one had fallen, the victors would hardly have left the body behind. The skulls would therefore almost certainly have been identified.  "Nos. 10 and 11 were hanging on poles in front of a village and people claimed that they were Maasai skulls. Even if this statement has a lot going for it, it cannot be ruled out that the people have pinned up some skulls as renown skulls, but now claim that they come from their greatest enemies - the Maasai.  "Nos. 13-22 can again be regarded as certain. They were collected on the battlefield. According to various accounts, the Maasai had set up camp there and were then attacked and beaten to death by the inhabitants of the country. They had then stuck their heads on poles and sharpened branches. However, a few Wassukuma are also said to have fallen. Even if it cannot be assumed that people put the heads of their own dead on the trees, it is still possible that one or two skulls will turn out to be Wassukuma skulls."  The skulls have since come into my hands, with the exception of Nos. 1 and 14. As I am currently busy working on the anthropological part of Mr. Stuhlmann's major new work, I will confine myself today to giving a few clear details and presenting a few skulls for illustration.  There is no need for me to explain how valuable the possession of 8 Wanyamwesi and 13 Maasai skulls is compared to the paucity of anthropological material we have suffered from up to now. For me personally, and I hope also for science, this is doubly useful at the present time, when Stuhlmann's collections from the west bank of the Victoria Nyanza and deep into the Congo region enable me to make precise comparisons.  In this regard, I will first provide some information about the volume of the skulls. While examining the dwarf skulls brought back by Stuhlmann from the upper Ituri, I came across the surprising fact that among 6 identifiable skulls of the species, only 2 were nannocephalic, while 3 gave a capacity of Ii60-1280, a sixth even of 1305 cm. Even more surprising was the discovery that among the 8 Wanyamwesi skulls of Count v. Schweinitz, 4, i.e. half, were nannocephalic. Among the Maasai, the frequency increased slowly, but then decreased again rapidly, as the following table shows:

The ear-height index of the 5 lmal hypsicephalic, while the same number of cases was orthocephalic, as I wanted to wait these numbers of observers from the fact that such a large between the heads of eastern neighbors does not exist, so form of the same an ethnic diagno well to show that the notion subjectivity, which the theory can be turned ahead.  In this respect, some other observations relating to certain so-called pithecoid characteristics may be of particular importance.  Foremost among these are the anomalies of the temporal region, namely the 3 main categories of these which I have repeatedly discussed, namely the frontal process of the temporal scales, the epiptericum and the simple stenocrotapia. All three are present in great frequency and diversity in the Africans with which we are concerned here. As I reserve a more detailed discussion for the work of Stuhlmann, I give here only a small statistic of the anomalous skull findings: Verhandl. der lierl. Authropol. Society 1893, 32

 has a distinctly orthodolichocephalic type (L.-Br.-I. 68.7, L.-H.-I. 73.2).  Its former bearer must therefore be described as a cephalonic Negro. There can be no question of a pithelcoid atavism when the overall proportions are taken into account. - Figure 1 Figure 2 Finally, I would like to add that Count v. Schweinitz also brought me a hair sample. It comes from a Msinje boy (No. 70 on the list). It is a pair of splendid spiral coils, 2 cm long and shiny black in color. On microscopic examination, the individual hairs appear fine, dark gray-brown, somewhat blotchy; the medullary stripe narrow, very dark and often interrupted; the ground substance light, with strongly brown spindles. - The question whether of the skulls collected by Count v. Schweinitz those listed under Nos. 2-9 belonged to the Wanyamwesi and the others to the Maasai is, according to the traveler's statements, not clear on the basis of numerical and 32*

 psychological reasons to be affirmed with great "probability. Mr. Stuhlmann drew my attention to another circumstance in particular, which he explained in more detail in his work on p. 433, note, namely the condition of the incisors. According to his observations, the Maasai use to knock out two lower incisors, while the Wanyamwesi create a triangular gap between the two central upper incisors by chipping off small pieces. Unfortunately, of the Wanyamwesi skulls handed over to me, only one (No. 4) has a lower jaw, but this shows no trace of a tooth being knocked out. In contrast, 12 of the Maasai skulls described have a lower jaw, and in all of these there is a scarred and atrophic gap in the alveolar margin at the location of the central lower incisors, which must be related to the early and violent removal of the teeth in question. Thus this feature, which Thomson (Durch Massai-Land. A. d. Engl, von W. v. Freeden Leipzig 1885. p. 381) has already mentioned of the Maasai, is present in sufficient numbers. The upper incisors are present in such a defective state, especially in the skulls interpreted as Wanyamwesi, that little can be said about them; only two of them show a gap in the upper jaw from an erupted central incisor.  An older compilation on these conditions among East African peoples by H. v. Ihering (Zeitschr. f. Ethnol. 1882, XIV, p. 227) may be referred to on this occasion, as it lists some local deviations (23) Hr. 0. Olshausen makes notes on the prehistory of Heligoland.  Literature.

Geerz, a native of Schleswig, the highly merited former head of the cartograph. The results of his investigations concerning the coastal changes of the North are recorded in the above historical maps. - The adjacent map of Helgland is based on his sketch of Meyer's map.  The landscape of Heligoland is known to consist of two separate parts, the main island and the dune; bathing takes place on the beach of the latter. The main island itself is divided into two contiguous parts: a high, reddish rock with steep slopes on all sides, whose almost flat, habitable upper surface is called the "Oberland", and the sandy Unterland, which rises only a few meters above sea level and abuts directly on it, from where maritime traffic takes place.  The Oberland forms approximately an unequal-sided, obtuse-angled triangle with the obtuse "angle in the east, while the other corners lie to the SE and NW, but are usually called the southern and northern points. The longest Sei faces SW, the next smaller one NNE, the shortest one finally 0, nauer OzS.1). The latter is preceded by the lower land, and opposite it to the east, separated from the main island by a wide "strip of water, lies the dune, resting on a rocky base that does not or only insignificantly exceed the sea level, the extension of which to the NW forms a series of submarine cliffs that become visible at low tide.  The dune used to be connected to the main island by a narrow strip of stony sand, the "Steenwall", which, according to Bötticher p. 2, was no higher "than that an extraordinary tide cleared, overhung", and which was then also breached by the sea in the storm surge of Dec. 31, 1720 and Jan. 1, 1721. Accordingly, the picture reproduced on p. 504, Fig. 2, in Lass (1758) also shows the dune separately, while Meyer's map and the "Abriss von 1713" still show it connected to the main island. The present lowland is to be regarded as a remnant of the rampart, enlarged by the partial washing away of the debris of the destroyed part of it and by the crumbling away of the red rock. Knobloch did not yet know of a lowland in the current sense, but rather understood it to be the dune, so that one could go from the Steenwall to 1) Bötticher compared the Obelland with a trapezoid, the shortest side of which was at the NW tip. Strangely enough, he called the eastern side the southern side and the eastern tip "jNatthorn", i.e. the northern tip (p. 26.0-63, 269). - According to Wiebel's measurements, pp. 72-73, the Oberland shows a sea level which, calculated at ordinary low tide, varies between 193.8 Hamburg feet at Mörmers (a point on the SW shore, close to and W v the old lighthouse) and 87 feet at the eastern corner, i.e., calculated as Hamburg feet = 0.2865, between 55.524 and 24.926 rn.


Page 504

 Obertheil, on the other hand, could come to the Untertheil (pp. 5-7). Bötticher also defined the Unterland in the same way (p. 260).  Figure 2: The present harbor was divided into two parts, the north and south harbor, by the Steenwall.  In addition to the red rock, the stone wall and the dune, there is evidence of a fourth part of the island from the older period. A Holstein yogt on Heligoland, Georg Brueck or Bruick, who seems to have resided there before 1545 (cf. W i e b e 1, p. 21), reported on the island to Heinrich Ranzau, Royal Danish governor in the duchies. The report is given by Ranzau p. 69 and also quite similarly by Braun, Civitates, and Pontanus. In Ranzau the passage, as far as it interests us, reads: "Constat Insula haec tota binis rupibus, separatis, rubenti una, candenti altera. Prior Altera insulae sacrae rupes, quae candet, sabulosa est, et calcem, quae excisa divenditur, gignit1)- Cuniculi in ea latibula habent"; i.e. "The whole island consists of two separate rocks, one of which is red, the other white. The former . . .  The other rock of the holy island, of white color, is sandy and contains lime, which is broken and sold Rabbits have their hiding places in it." This last addition undoubtedly refers to the dune sand, in which masses of rabbits still live on other North Frisian islands today (while they are now extinct on the dunes of Heligoland; see Meyn in Vierteljahrs-Schrift, p. 32). If the calcareous rock is therefore called sandy, this can only indicate a direct connection between the calcareous rock and the dune; "Wiebel therefore also translates "sabulosa" on p. 22 as "surrounded by sand" and Oetker, p. 58, says: "the white rock with the sand was sandy". Since the dune was also connected to the red rock by the stone wall, the white and red rocks were also connected to each other, although they naturally appeared separate from a distance, as they both towered significantly above the stone wall and the dune. For Knobloch says p. 6: "The lower part, the Duyne, lies on the plain (i.e. low), although it also has a cliff towards the north, which is almost equal to the upper part of the land in height and white in color, and also gives off chalky white stones; wherefore it is then called by the inhabitants dat witte Klieff (or the white cliff)." Danckwerth adds on p. 153: "(the cliff) is small and uninhabited". "Small" can, however, 1) The words "et calcem . . . gignit" are missing in Braun and Po 11 tan us.


Page 505

 only in relation to the upper surface of the red rock; this white rock was significant enough in itself. Meyer's map for 1649 shows the "Witteklyppe" as a fairly extensive rock plateau, and a few years before 1699 a shooting range was laid out on it (Botticher, pp. 263-64).  The technical exploitation of the rock of which Ranzau speaks can be traced back to the first half of the 16th century, as Adolfi reports in the Historia vom Seeräuber Wiben Peter about a demand for "stone and lime" on Heligoland in 1545 (p. 87). In 1618 the yield was still so great that only low prices could be achieved (Lass p. 39). A few years later, at the time Adolfi was writing, mining seems to have stopped, as Adolfi says on p. 85 that "lime was once dug up"; but it must have been resumed later and the material quickly diminished. For in 1699, according to Bötticher p. 263, there was only "a small piece of the white cliff left", according to Wiebel, pp. 195-96, of the height of a "haystack". It disappeared on Nov. 1, 1711 during a storm surge." On the picture "Abriss anno 1713", also reproduced by Lindemann, the Wittkliff should therefore no longer be found and my copy of L.'s work also only vaguely shows a rock at the northern end of the dune. But in another reproduction of the same picture, whose place of publication I cannot prove, but which was engraved by Endne in 1810, a rock can be seen between the dune and the northern end of the main island, clearly distinguishable from the dunes, quite high but with a small base. If this is really the Wittkliff, it is an anachronism.  We will come back to the Wittkliff, which is interesting not only geologically but also archaeologically, in detail. It should only be noted here that the breakthrough of the stone embankment in 1720-21 is generally believed to be causally connected with the disappearance of the protective Wittkliff. The hole in the dam was closed again after a year (Wiebel p. 196), but probably not for long. According to Lass p. 16 note i, it was still possible to cross over to the dune in 1730, but then the water became too deep, and Wiebel found the smallest distance between the dune and the main island at high tide to be 3940 (3840?) Hamburg feet.  The hills of the island. Their number, names and location.  The rocky plateau of the Oberland slopes from the SW side towards the eastern tip, so the island is highest on the SW side. There are still three mounds here, and a fourth has only recently disappeared. This contradicts what the first reliable report on Heligoland says about the number of mounds. Master Adam, canon and scholast in Bremen, notes in lib. 4, cap. 3 of his "gesta" (Monum. Germ. p. 369): [insula] collem habet unicum, arborem nullam. This cannot be interpreted, as was done by v. d. Decken p. 26, as if the island consisted only of a single hill or mountain, the still existing red rock. For the white cliff was large enough to be considered next to the latter; furthermore, the term "Collis" does not fit well in our regions for elevations of the size of the Oberland, which one would call "mons", and finally "habet" can have no other meaning in relation to Collis than connected with arbor, as Laurent and Wattenbach also translate: "it has a single hill, no tree" (pp. 202-3). Wiebel therefore rightly rejects Decken's view on p. 24 f. and thinks of a smaller elevation, roughly the size of the grave.


Page 506

 mounds, on the Oberland itself. But his assumption, as if only one such mound really existed at that time, is nevertheless not correct, since, as we shall see, two of the mounds that have come down to us can be shown with certainty to have existed long before Adam's time in Bremen, and the same can probably be said of a third.  Adam must therefore have had a mound in mind that was significantly larger than all the others.  If we now disregard this writer, we find the first mention of Heligoland's hills in 1638 in Sachs; Ranzau is silent about them. Sachs mentions, incidentally only occasionally, p. 234 four hills: the Moder-, Breith-, Giess- and Roden- or Radbodberg. He does not say anything about their origin or the meaning of their names. - A few years later Knobloch reports, p. 11: "On the plain (of the upper part) there are also various small mountains or hills, of which there were 7 in number in ancient times, but today 5 of them remain." He names these latter as follows: I. Rotenburg, Rodenberg or Radbodberg; 2. Moderberg, Modersberg or Marsberg; 3. Bredt berg; 4. Giessberg or Kiessberg; 5. Flavenberg. The two that have disappeared are not mentioned. - The next most recent report, by Danckwerth, discusses only the Rodenberg, the Bredeberg and the Giessberg or Kiessberg on p. 154, but the corresponding map by Meyer for 1649 shows all 5 hills of Knobloch, but no more, namely 4 on the SW side, from the NW to the SE tip in the following order: Flavenberg, Gies vel Kiessberg, Bredtberg, Moderberg; the fifth, the Radbodberg, near the east corner on the NNE side. The sequence is therefore the same as Knobloch's, starting at the eastern tip and proceeding NW via the SE tip. It is now possible that Meyer took the names and sequence from Knobloch's work, but acted arbitrarily when pixilating the first member of the series of names on a particular hill.  G e e r z, however, did not hesitate to enter the hills in the same way in his new draft of Meyer's map, and the actual position of some of the hills mentioned can also be determined as corresponding to the above arrangement, as we shall soon see. First of all, it should be noted that Bötticher, 1699, knows: the Bredenberg, Moderberg, "in which a powder logiment", Lootsenberg, St. Gietsberg and Flavenberg, "together with two other small mountains without names" (p. 265 and 266). St. Gietsberg was called St. Tietsberg elsewhere (p. 258); perhaps the names Giessberg and Tietsberg are mixed up here.  The Radbodberg received this name, as is now generally assumed, only erroneously from the Frisian prince from the beginning of the 8th century AD, whom Alcuin mentions in his Life of St. Willi brord, the Frisian apostle (-j- 739). Rather, it was probably called Roadberg, i.e. red mountain, hence the corresponding names in Knob loch, while Danckwerth, on the other hand, considers Rodenberg to have been mutilated from Radbodberg (p. 154). The hill must have already disappeared in Lass' time (§ 17, note 1), but the area in which it is said to have been located according to Meyer still bears this name among the sailors (cf. Hallier, p. 69). - The Bredtberg or Bredeberg can be identified more reliably.  Knobloch says: "Der Bredtberg, von der Breite so genandt; Woraufauf anjtzo der Pharos oder Fewer back stehet." (This is the first ever mention of a beacon on Heligoland). Danckwerth now states that on the Bredeberg "a Pharos or Feurbacke was held in the past", as


Page 507

 if this was no longer the case in his time, and accordingly Meyer's map of 1649 shows no fire beacon on the Bredberg, nor anywhere else; but half a century later Bötticher again mentions the "Feuer baacke auf dem Bredenberg" (8.265), and the "Abriss" of 1703 at least shows the Feuerthurm. Finally Lass remarks, § 70, note e: "Der Pharus, der Feuer-Back, oder die Feuer-Blüse steht auf einen Berg, so vormahls Bred Berg hiesse". On his picture of the island, the mountain with the tower of fire is accordingly drawn, but not named in E. - The old lighthouse, which still stands on a very significant and in particular very broad hill, is said to have been built in the 17th century1), while the new one was only erected in 1810; so Bötticher and Lass could only have had that one in mind, and the hill that still bears it today must be Knobloch's Bredtberg.  Of course, it is now called "the Balsberg" after the Feuerbake. - Finally, the location of the Flavenberg can be determined. Lass also knows the name "Flagenberg" for the "Flauenberg" in § 34, note c, which he rejects. However, since the mountain always bears one of these names on the maps and views according to Meyer and is still called "Flaggenberg" today, there can be no doubt about its identity. In Lass' picture, it is Mount G. If Meyer's assumptions regarding the location of Roadberg, Bredberg and Flavenberg are therefore correct, then his interpolation of Moderberg and Kiessberg can also be accepted, although both have disappeared today and Wie at p. 44 that the names "Martisburg" and "Kiesberg" in Meyer's map, which shows the alleged changes of the island since 800, are marked on the part that disappeared before 1300, but in the map of 1649 "Moderberg" and "Kiessberg" are marked on the present Oberlande. The error here, however, lies with the former map, as the names of the mountains of the Oberland were established by Sachs and Knobloch for the period after 1638. There is also a very specific reference point for the Moderberg. The "Pulverlogiment" was built there "several years" before 1699 (Bötticher p. 266 and 284). This powder magazine is mentioned again in a document from 1714 (Jahrbücher für die Landeskunde Schleswig Holstein-Lauenburgs, vol. 10, Kiel 1869, p. 280), and Lass notes that "the powder is stored in a brick cellar on the Moderberg, which, together with the mountain, is well equipped with a stack". His picture of the island shows the "Powder Tower" as Hill F, surrounded by the stack. - Finally, in 1790 Hasselmann wrote: "The Moderberg is vaulted and has served as a powder magazine for as long as this island has been a fortress" (vol. 1, p. 10). - Today there is still a powder magazine, a small, square brick building with a roof, near the south-eastern tip (cf. e.g. the map of the Reichs-Marine-Amtes from 1890 and especially that of Rodowicz). Of course, it is not situated on a hill, has no vault inside and therefore could not have been covered with earth and could hardly have been a "cellar" in the present sense. But Mr. A. P. Botter, until 1846 on Heligoland, now in Brake on the Weser, tells me from his own experience that this little house, which even then had a tiled roof, was surrounded by a mound in such a way that there was about 1 m of space around it. This is how he knew it at the beginning in 1845; four years later 1) The shape of the tower is not recognizable in Lass' work; Camerer's copy of the picture shows it as six-sided, while the present tower is four-sided. In any case, Camerer's design is arbitrary.


Page 508

 Rodowicz's map no longer shows a hill surrounding the house, but in the western corner of a small four-sided square leveled around the house there is an insignificant mound of earth - the rest of that larger hill, which is completely consistent with information kindly obtained for me by Pastor Schröder. Since there are no reports of other hills in the neighborhood, the identification of the hill described with the Moderberg is beyond doubt. Incidentally, the last trace of the elevation still shown by Rodowicz was removed for fortification purposes during my presence on Heligoland in August of this year.  Knobloch said that the Giessberg or Kiessberg was so named "because the pilots are on this mountain every day and can recognize the ships arriving at sea from afar". That K. had a very specific mountain in mind, which he knew well, follows unambiguously from his further remark "that one can see the whole country on top of it, except for a small corner on the northern horn (i.e. on the NW tip)". - Danckwerth confirmed that the pilots looked out for ships on the Giessberg. Lass no longer mentions the name Gies- or Kiessberg, but speaks of the "Lootsen- or Schipberg", and says that it lies NW of the Feuerthurm, which is quite consistent with Meyer's location of the Gies- or Kiessberg. The only striking thing is that Lass adds: "not far from there (i.e. from the Lootsenberg) is the Backberg or bret berg". According to Lass' own statement mentioned above, the latter would itself carry the Feuerthurm. In any case, it must be assumed that all that is meant here is: "The Lootsenberg lies NW of and quite close to the Bredberg, on which the Feuerthurm stands."  The "Schipberg" is marked on the Reinke-Lang-Heather map as a landmark for skippers to sail to from the NW (namely NW near the old lighthouse), so it must have been visible from afar at that time.  A nameless mountain on Papen's map also corresponds to it. In the edition by v. d. Decken, the name "Bredte B." is just on it; but it must refer to the neighboring hill with the tower. More recent writers attach the name Schipberg, in part apparently erroneously, to other points on the island, about which more immediately.  In addition to the 5 hills mentioned above, others on the island are also named. Bötticher writes in 1699 (p. 258) of a hill on which a worship of the patron god of fishing, St. Tiets, had taken place.  "The mountain is still there today and has received its name as St. Tiets-Berg". However, Lass notes in 1753 that half of this Tietensberg had already fallen into the sea and that nothing is known about its former location. Of course, it could not have been one of the two mountains Knobloch had already described as having disappeared; Knobloch seems to have overlooked it, as was demonstrably the case with another.  Lass also reports: "To the south of the fire tower, a hill can be seen which is called the small mountain or Lütge Berg". This note is of particular interest to us, as we will prove that this is an ancient burial mound. Apparently it is one of Bötticher's two small nameless mounds. According to Lass, it has also been mentioned several times, but usually with the wrong name. Thus Nie mann p. 205 says: "about 100 steps from the Bredtberg, to the south, the Moderberg, which formerly served as a powder magazine", and he is followed by v. d. Decken p. 12, as well as on the accompanying map by Papen the name is not quite in the right place and


Page 509

 is marked differently from Dierks' original sketch. Furthermore, Oetker p. 73 describes a hill south of the old lighthouse, "which he cannot find on any map", as "Skeppberg", and Hallier agrees with him p. 76. But according to Hasselmann 1790, vol. 1, p. 10, the Moderberg (with the powder magazine) was "a couple of hundred paces south of the Blüse" and on Rodowicz's map, which is so accurate, the old powder house with the remnant of the hill is in fact 250 paces SE of the old fire tower. On the other hand, Rodowiez has a low mound only 100 very small steps SE of the tower, which is apparently the "little Ber Lass's". Rodowicz's map seems to have remained unknown to Oetker, and we also know that the Schipberg lay NW of the tower, not south Hasselmann, like Knobloch, overlooked the small mountain despite Lass; he only mentions Bredtberg, Moder- and Flagenberg and remarks that some other hills have already completely or partially collapsed. - Lindemann often mentions a "small Bredberg" and described this hill as such to me on the spot. However, there is no evidence anywhere that it is also called Bredberg, and the correct term is obviously: small mountain. The oral tradition of the people of Heligoland has completely disappeared and is already so confused that it unfortunately no longer provides any reliable reference. You can only go by older printed documents. Most of the people I asked called the small mountain "Billberg", although a place to the NW of the old lighthouse, close to the edge of the cliff, is also called this, which now hardly appears as an elevation, but is marked on the coastal map of Heligoland by Wiebel m i (about 90 m from the tower). Lindemann in turn identifies (p. 35) this latter Billberg with the Lootsenberg or Schipberg, which would roughly correspond to the location of the Schipberg on Reinke's map of 1809 and the unnamed mountain near Papen; so perhaps both names have been transferred to the small mountain at the same time in more recent times. As you can see, the confusion could not be greater. Incidentally, the name "Billberg" is quite modern - Oetker tells a story about it on p. 76.  Finally, it should be noted that a point marked h1 on Wiebel's coastal map and named "Lögenberg" cannot be identified "if it is not the rest of the Giessberg" (Oetker p. 73). - The four hills of Heligoland still recognizable in our time were therefore undoubtedly: the Moderberg, the small mountain, the Bredberg and the Flavenberg.  Condition of the mounds in the summer of 1893, news of earlier finds in them and investigation of the "small mountain".  Most of the mounds mentioned have long been regarded as artificial, according to Wiebel p. 25, who thinks they were built and used for various purposes, but, since he believes in the "only" mound of Master Adam, he can only regard one of them as an old pagan burial mound and must consider all the others to be younger; also Hallier p. 78, who says: "they are mostly burial mounds, robbed of their contents". Lindemann also speaks in favor of burial mounds, pp. 31, 35-36. The Flaggenberg is located near Rodowiez about 1000 steps NWzN from the old Feuerthurm. It is dug up on the north side after Hallier. Rodowicz's map also clearly shows such an attack site to the NW. According to Linde man, a powder house was built on top of it later, at the end of the sixties; I found it built completely into the mountain, so that only a ring of the latter remains as a protective wall, which of course cannot be examined.


Page 510

 I was certainly denied that old objects had come to light during the construction of the house, and the statement that English officers had occasionally unearthed such objects during an excavation (perhaps at the above-mentioned site in (NW?) is uncontrollable. Nevertheless, the assumption "burial mound" has a lot going for it; in Lass' picture it appears as a mighty, isolated, roundish mountain (G).  The Bredberg is of very considerable size and would be wide enough to bear the name. It bears the old, solidly built, square lighthouse, the Feuerbake, which now serves as a signal station following the erection of a new tower in the vicinity. Its base is 197.3 Hamburg feet = 56.526 m above the sea according to measurements taken by the astronomer Schumacher in 1824. Wiebel found the tower itself to be 22.58 H. feet = 6.469 m\ total height therefore around 63 m (Wiebel pp. 72-73). A complete investigation of the hill would be impossible because of the tower; however, according to Hasselmann, "human bones and urns" were found in the hill during the construction of the latter (Prov. Berichte 1790, vol. 1, pp. 9-10) and Wiebel therefore considers the Bredberg to be the "only" hill of Adam of Bremen.  The Moderberg. A grave was found in this mound, whose exact location we have established above, at the beginning of 1845. The powder house was therefore built into an old mound, just like the Flaggenberg, the rest of which surrounded it like a ring wall. This refutes Wiebel's view (p. 25) that the Moderberg was only created by throwing earth over the magazine.  Fortunately, the grave itself remained untouched during the installation. We have reports about it from Hallier (p. 70, reprinted in Meyn "Zur Geologie" p. 5) and especially from Lindemann, whose two reports (Helgoland p. 36 and this Verhandl. 1893, pp. 24-25) do not agree with each other on some points. The latter refers to an (unnamed) eyewitness; this is Mr. Botter, to whom I also owe further detailed information. The facts are as follows: children had been playing near the gunpowder house, noticed peculiar, apparently brightly colored lines in the mound of earth on the west side and, by digging away the earth between them with their hands, found bones. This came to the attention of Jacob Andresen-Siemens, the shipbuilder, later councillor and town secretary, the founder of the seaside resort on Heligoland and author of the book "Die Insel H., 1835", and he decided to investigate the matter. The spa doctor at the time, Dr. von Aschen, also paid attention to it. However, as Mr. Botter was secretary to Siemens at the time, his statements are the most important; he also made every effort to support me in my findings regarding the nature and whereabouts of the finds. What could still be determined is almost entirely due to him.  Two of these strips, apparently stone, were found lying parallel to each other at a distance of 8 inches and about 2 inches thick, with the bones between them. When the earth was carefully removed, the presumed stone was found to have turned to sand. However, this cannot have been the case throughout, since, as we shall see later, thanks to the care of the late Mr. Erich Lassen, then landlord of Siemens, solid pieces of one of the slabs are still preserved. The individual stones were probably of different natures and thus withstood the atmospheric agents unequally well. Originally, the bones were probably lying on stone slabs and were also covered with them, although Mrs. Rickmer J. Hahn, a daughter of Lassen, expressly told me that the latter was not the case. Mr. Botter leads

 However, he attributed this contrary view to the weathering of the stones, which could have been more advanced in the top slabs than in the base slabs.  The bones belonged to a largely well-preserved skeleton, according to the opinion of Mr. Botter a male one, and according to a statement by Dr. v. Aschen that of a strong, but not exceptionally tall man. That it was indeed the skeleton of a man will be established later from the grave goods. The position of the body was more or less to the west-east. The feet rested at the eastern end; the head, at the western end, was lying normally, i.e. with the face upwards. The arm and leg bones were still solid, the teeth were all present and completely preserved, but the skull and other smaller bones had disintegrated. According to Mr. Botter, the skeleton was found with 2 golden spiral discs about 5 cm in diameter, made of single wire, weighing a total of 2 double louisd'or, one each on the right and left hips, and a bronze weapon on the left side. I was also told about "gold rings" and a "sword handle". I also heard of some "double buttons", one of which was said to still be privately owned on the island. It turned out, however, that there was a completely worthless pair of brass, solidly cast, spherical buttons with a protruding eyelet, connected by a wire chain - a modern product that may have been lying superficially under the grass. - In order to determine the nature of the "weapon" and, in some respects, the spiral disks, I tried to find out where they were. But nothing is known for certain. Mr. Botter writes to me: "Siemens sent the bronze weapons, not the gold spirals, to an antiquities society in Copenhagen, which kept them there and in return sent two books in German, one of which contained drawings and descriptions of Nordic bronze weapons, including one similar to the Helgoland weapon. To store the gold spirals and skeletal remains, Siemens had boxes made of white wood in the shape of English coffins and decorated with views of Heligoland." Siemens soon got into disputes with other town councillors on H. and, according to a written communication from Mrs. Hahn, went to England, where he fell ill and died completely penniless in 1846 or 1847. No information could be obtained about the whereabouts of the caskets.  I first turned to Copenhagen, where the bronze weapon is said to have remained. But Mr. Director Dr. S. Müller wrote to me that the National Museum had no prehistoric artefacts from Heligoland at all, and even when I later obtained information about the nature of the weapon by other means, thus making the search easier, Mr. Egil Petersen only stated again, according to the accession records and catalogs, that the museum did not possess or receive any finds from Heligoland. Nor does it contain any golden spiral disks of the type mentioned. I suspect that the bronze was incorporated into the collection of the later King Frederik VII and perished with it in the fire at Frederiksborg Castle in 1859. In any case, neither in Kiel, nor in Hamburg, nor, it seems, in England is there any knowledge of the whereabouts of this find or of the spirals and bones. Miss Mestorf writes to me that the Kiel Museum has nothing from Heligoland. According to Dr. Hagen, the collection of prehistoric antiquities in the Museum of Natural History in Hamburg only has a flint splinter from the Oberland. Finally, Sir John Evans in Nash Mills, who has the goodness


Page 512

 had to make inquiries for me in England: "there are no antiquities from Heligoland in the British Museum, nor do I know of any in private collections in England".  So with regard to the weapon and spirals, we have to rely solely on Mr. Botter's memory. He wrote to me about the bronze: "It was a thrusting weapon, designed to be attached to a wooden stick, but whether it was a spearhead is questionable. It had no point, but a narrow edge. I cannot make a drawing of it, but I think I would recognize it from one. The title of the book with the corresponding illustration has unfortunately slipped my mind." In my opinion, the latter could only be the "Leitfaden zur nordischen Alter thumskunde, Kopenhagen 1837", or Worsaae's "Dänemarks Vorzeit, 1844".  Even Mr. Petersen could not provide me with any other book that would come into consideration.  However, Mr. Botter did not recognize either of the two works sent to him as the correct one, but he stated that the paal staff in the guide, p. 54 above, is similar to the Helgoland weapon, only has a wider blade, and that therefore the middle figure in Worsaae, p. 22, a paal staff with a very narrow (or only very shortened?) blade, corresponds perfectly to the find in question. In response to further drawings and questions from me, he also stated that the piece had raised side edges, as in Sophus Müller, Ordning af Danmarks Oldsager II, 1891, Fig. 38, and that it had already been agreed when it was found that the weapon must have been inserted into a split piece of wood and secured by leather strips or cords, as shown in the figure in "Denmark's Vorzeit".  It is therefore undoubtedly certain that it was a Nutencelt or Paal stab, i.e. an axe (cf. Worsaae, Nordiske Oldsager, 1859, No. 181, 183; Mestorf, Vorgeschichtliche Alterthümer aus Schleswig - Holstein, 1885, Fig. 216-17), or because of the narrowness of the cutting edge perhaps a chisel, as Worsaae N. 0. 182, Müller Ordning 40. Mr. B. did not notice any ornamentation, as in all the illustrations mentioned, so that one can also think of a paal stick, like Müller 39; however, Mr. Botter admits the possibility that decorations were only not visible because of the inadequate cleaning of the object.  The golden spiral discs are interesting in that, as far as I know, such decoration is not found elsewhere in Nordic graves of this kind, whereas spiral cylinders, partly for the finger, partly for the arm, are extremely common in single, but especially in double gold wire. (Cf. my work on spiral rings, this publication 1886, 433 ff.). I therefore suspected that they might have merged into cylinders at one end, like the two double-wire disks from Tschanschwitz in Silesia, whose cylinders fit the finger (Spiral rings pp. 455-56, Figs. 1 and 2, Breslau Museum No. 857, 1884; 415, 1891; one right-handed, the other left-handed). However, Mr. Botter assures that there was no such device on the Helgoland disks. The pieces could therefore perhaps have been attached to the clothing and then probably to the lower end of the sleeves, as otherwise the position on the hips is difficult to understand. The question is, however, whether we are dealing here with two separate pieces of jewelry or rather with similar parts of a larger piece. First of all, I would like to remind you of the golden brooch (formerly with a loose pin) from the central grave of the "Swarten Barges" near Gönnebek,


Page 513

 Ksp. Bornhöved in Holstein, next to burnt bones (Handelmann. Alterth.  Bericht 38, Kiel 1885, title page and p. 23; Mestorf, Vorgeschichtliche Alterthiimer ans Schleswig-Holstein, Hamburg 1885, Fig. 341). The pair of golden spiral cylinders from Röcknitz near Dargun in Meklenburg also belong here, both ends of which are also rolled up into spiral plates and which are too wide for the finger and too narrow for the arm (Meklb. Jahrb. 15, p. 269, without illustration).  In particular, however, reference must be made to Hungarian jewelry, brooches and the like, in which such combinations of spiral discs, mostly of course in bronze, play a major role, partly as constructive parts, partly as accessories. It is therefore possible that the disks are fragments of an object whose connecting link had been lost. Incidentally, I can provide indirect confirmation of Mr. Botter's observation "disks, not cylinders". The 3 times that I found cylindrical arm spirals in pairs on Am rum, both were always on one and the same arm (Yerh. 1886, pp. 453-54), while here those pieces were distributed on both sides of the body.  I have not encountered finger rings in pairs.  If, according to our above information, any prospect of seeing the grave goods from the Moderberg reappearing at some point is fading, parts of one of the stone slabs have been preserved. According to Hallier, a large slab of "late, solid gypsum" from the grave was still in Mr. Lassen's possession in 1862; I can currently find the following remains of it: One piece, through H.'s mediation, in the Grossherzogl Sächs. mineralog. Museum in Jena; a small one, formerly in the possession of Dr. Lindemann, in the Natural History Museum in Hamburg (through Dr. Gottsche) and in the geological-paleontological collection of the King]. Collection of the König]. Museum für Naturkunde zu Berlin (by Professor Dames); a small one on Helgoland in the hands of Mr. P. C. Reimers, Bindfadenallee; a larger one there in the possession of Mrs. Hahn; finally one, 32'/j cm long, 27 1/2 cm wide and up to almost 5 cm thick, as a gift from Mrs. Hahn, at present still in my hands, but intended for a museum. The thickness of the slab may originally have been much greater, as thin layers of clay in between favored its disintegration into several sheets.  There is sufficient evidence to determine the date of the grave in the Moderberg. We can refer to the conditions on the neighboring islands on the west coast of Schleswig. Sylt has been archaeologically investigated by Handelmann, Amrum I investigated myself. Heligoland now has more connections to these North Frisian islands than to the East Frisian ones. In historical times it belonged politically to Schleswig; but more importantly, it is also dialectically close to North Friesland, and I have noticed that many place names, legends and beliefs can be found on Heligoland in exactly the same way as on Amrum. If this leads to the conclusion that the population was the same, then it is also likely that the same burial customs existed in prehistoric times. Inhumation, without cremation, was common on the North Frisian Islands in the Early Bronze Age; cremation was only rarely found (on Sylt) at the same time, and only occurred more frequently later, as was also the case in neighboring Denmark (cf. my reports in these proceedings 1890, 277-79; 1892, 144-45).  Grave cists made of stone slabs are also frequently found on Sylt; if they were mostly replaced by piles of loose field stones on Amrum, this must probably be attributed to a lower frequency of larger slab-shaped stones. The fact that only base and top slabs were found in the Moderberg, not a complete cist, Verhandl. der Berl. Anthropol. Society 1893. BB

 is irrelevant, as a real box made of the same material - gypsum - was found in a grave to be described later. The peculiarity of this material has a purely local cause, about which more later. Celt with groove and heel, whether with a broad edge as a weapon or a narrower edge as a chisel, also belong to the Early Bronze Age, and according to Sophus Müller to the older part of it (cf. Aarböger f. nord. Oldkyndighed 1891, p. 192 ff.), or according to Montelius to its period II (Tidsbestämning inom Bronzäldern, Stock holm 1885). At the same time, this piece confirms that the buried body was a male, as such weapons or implements only occur in male graves (Aarböger 1886, 251; 1891, 190, 192).  The golden spiral plates are not very suitable for determining the time, but they do not contradict the above result. I discussed the occurrence of gold on the North Sea coast in the form of spiral cylinders made of double wire, for arm and finger, in these proceedings 1890, 277-80. On Amrum it belongs mainly to Montelius' period III, which corresponds roughly to Müller's younger section of the Early Bronze Age, but it also occurs in Montelius' period II, Müller's 11. However, this is not conclusive for the spiral disks made of simple wire, all the less so as these rings are found considerably later in other regions, even up to the beginning of the pure Iron Age, the La Tene period. But the close connection of the disks with the cylindrical gold jewelry in general can be seen in pieces such as those already mentioned from Tschanschwitz in Silesia and others from the province of Posen and from Bohemia, which I discussed in Verh. 1886, pp. 455-57, and, which is particularly relevant here, in my heavy Amrum bracelet, Verh. 1886, 451, whose double wire ends in two volutes. The gold disks therefore present no difficulty in determining the date of the grave; the old Bronze Age (first half of the millennium BC) has thus been established for Heligoland.   The small hill, evenly overgrown with grass, was irregularly bounded, apparently as a result of the removal or filling in of earth from the surrounding terrain. For the same reason, it appeared to be of unequal height from different sides, higher on the south side than on the north side, and somewhat elongated from W to O. It was flattened. On its northern side, it is evident that it was dug away somewhat in earlier times, but the wound was covered with a scar. Lindemann mentions rumors that ancient objects were found in the mound in the past; perhaps this excavation was the reason for this, but in my opinion it could only have been on the surface1). - The overall impression was that of a burial mound and the kar 1) I will leave aside whether the excavation was perhaps connected with the construction of an observatory. According to the information in Wiebel p. 60, the temporary observatory must have stood very close to the small hill, where Hansen first determined the geographical position of Heligoland more reliably in 1818 as 54° 10' 46.51" north latitude, 7° 53' 5.85" 0 from Greenwich.  From this point, set at 1 toise = 1.949 m, the new lighthouse was: N 104.99 m W 29.82 m the old lighthouse: N 50.83 m W 53.58 m the church tower : N 333.20 m 0 69.77 m These distances entered in Rodowici's map give a point not far from the foot of the hill in the NE; only the indication: church tower 0 69.77 m does not fit, as I find the position of the tower to the east, but not so far to the east. This deviation cannot be attributed to the new construction of the tower in 1885 alone.


Page 515

 of the land registry also refers to it as a "megalithic grave", but a natural elevation could also be considered. Finally, there was another view to consider.  Meyn says in Cotta's Vierteljahrs-Schrift p. 14: "The mountains consist of heaped up mass, namely partly of lumps of coal". Accordingly, the opinion that the hill was nothing but a heap of cinders, originating from the coal fire that burned for a time on the old lighthouse, was quite widespread with regard to the small mountain. According to Lass § 70, note e, candles (probably in a lantern on wood construction) seem to have been burned on the fire beacon first. According to Lindemann (p. 100; admittedly with unfounded reference to Lass), however, an open fire (in an iron basket) was maintained on the square brick tower built in 1670 and still standing today, which seems to have consumed over 4000 pounds of coal on stormy nights since 1673 or a few years later (Lass op. cit.) (Niemann p. 228, probably after Hasselmann). It was not until 1810 that a new tower was built near the old one and on this occasion the open coal fire was replaced by a system of oil lamps. If the slag from the coal had been collected, a considerable stockpile would have been created. But there was nothing more obvious than to dispose of the waste on the immediately adjacent cliff edge, and it was quite improbable to me that such a uniform, solid grass cover could have formed on a pure slag heap. The assumption that it was one was based mainly on a few coals or ashes that had occasionally been noticed under the grass when a telegram pole was erected. However, this could have gotten there by chance, as the glowing cinders from the beacon were often thrown around by the storm, even as far as the houses in the village (Oetkcr p. 231, probably after Hasselmann).  After all this, I became convinced that I was looking at an essentially intact burial mound - the last one on Heligoland. However, this precious object was in an extremely endangered situation. Not only had several laymen turned their attention to it in recent years, but the new fortification of the island, which was still in progress, seemed to threaten the mound. It lay directly in front of an unfinished armored tower and not far from the still unfinished exit of the tunnel leading up from the harbor. Earth movements were still taking place here, and if material was still needed, the mound was easily accessible and could easily disappear without an expert archaeologist being called in to remove it. So I decided to carry out an investigation.  Thanks to the incomparable kindness of the then commander, Mr. Admiral Mensing, and the understanding response of the government assessor, Mr. Hans v. Eisenhart - Rothe, to my request, the formalities were completed. - The people of Heligoland no longer seem to be aware of the point in question.  Wiebel calculated the new lighthouse according to the above figures at 54° 10' 49.91" north latitude, 7° 53' 4.20" 0 from Greenwich.  The same calculation for the church tower, as given by Wiebel, shows the element 7.86" instead of 3.86" due to a printing error; the result 7° 53'9.71" is correct, however, if the figure 0 69.77 m is correct; but perhaps there is an error here. - According to the provisions of the Königl. Preuss. Landesaufnahme of 1886, the new lighthouse would lie at 54° 10' 57" north latitude; 7° 53' 10.9" 0 from Greenwich (see map of the Reichs-Marine-Amtes 1890).  33*

 difficulties were quickly overcome so that I could get straight to work.  In order to rule out any deception, I first dug an exploration shaft on August 28 in the south, where, according to my experience on Amrum, old objects were less common, penetrating from the edge towards the plateau, but leaving the center of the hill untouched. The mass of the latter consisted throughout of reddish-brown clay (as it forms the covering of the island's rock everywhere, formed by weathering from layers belonging to the lower Buntsandstein, i.e. the oldest member of the Triassic formation, low-calcium clays, calcareous sandstones and limestones; Dames pp. 1023-24). In the upper, completely dry layers it was exceptionally hard, in the lower, wetter layers it was equally tough and could only be worked with a hoe. The shaft was driven down to 2.75 m and from the bottom of the shaft was probed with an auger to a depth of about '/a m without reaching the rock. Right down to the bottom of the shaft, the mass of clay occasionally contained particles of charcoal, but also often small pieces of a concretion containing iron or manganese, which could be mistaken for hard coal slag. The auger, a very strong, wide, spirally wound iron band, finally brought up increasingly pure reddish-colored, moist, extremely plastic clay, in the lowest layer of which one could recognize the traces of decayed root fibers, so that here one was definitely on a previously exposed soil surface. This and the charcoal proved that the mound had been artificially raised, and so, although no trace of old material was found, I had the south-east quadrant of the mound cleared of its turf without hesitation in order to penetrate it from the south-east with a wide, deep trench, where in my experience there is the best chance of success. This assumption was fully confirmed. By noon the next day, stones had already been uncovered which later proved to be part of a large burial cist. As the trace of these could be followed right up to the telegraph pole standing roughly in the middle of the mountain, it became necessary to dig out and move the latter, whereby it became apparent that the hole dug at the time to accommodate the pole went down deeper than the edge of the box and would have infallibly destroyed the grave if it had only shifted very slightly to the SE.  By clearing away the surrounding masses of earth, the boundary of the stone setting was now determined and the latter uncovered to such an extent that on the third day the box could first be cleared of the last masses lying on and around it. This stage of the excavation is illustrated in the picture below (Fig. 3), based on a photograph by the court photographer Mr. G. Friede richs on Heligoland. One looks from the SE into the open hill and sees the old lighthouse on the Bredberge in the background. On the same day, the box was opened, emptied and completely excavated in order to secure the stone slabs forming it. - No antiquities had been unearthed either close to the top of the turf or during the entire excavation, with the exception of a small splinter of a sharpened flint, an axe or a chisel, which had obviously been thrown up with the mound mass. Post-burials are still completely absent in this mountain, and it is therefore very unlikely that ancient objects were found in it in the past, as rumor would have it.  The grave box was composed of white gypsum slabs and scattered pieces of gray-green sandstone or clay (cf. Dames, p. 1027). If the latter material was also used in part in the Moderberg


Page 517

 This may explain the incompleteness of the grave box in the grave and the lack of agreement between the reports regarding the cover plate, as moisture seems to have had a strong effect on it. Incidentally, the contents of this burial box were also assumed from the outset to be similar to those in that grave, which the examination on August 30, 1893 merely confirmed.  Figure 3: The box formed an oblong, the longitudinal axis of which, taking into account the misalignment of the compass, lay exactly NE-SW. The small sides in NE. and SW. were fairly straight, but one long side, in SE., was decidedly slanted outwards, so that the box was slightly wider at the top than at the bottom. This could not be seen so clearly on the other long side, in the NW, as it was partly destroyed, presumably when the mound was filled in, less probably when the telegraph pole was erected. Dimensions of the box, measured at the top and outside, 2000 and 750 mm. The SE side formed a single large slab, 1840 mm long, 650 mm high, irregularly shaped at the upper edge due to weathering and crumbling. The highest point of this edge was 1250 mm below the surface of the mound. - In the light the box was about 1810 mm long. - The bottom of the box was also formed by slabs, and since the side walls were dug down a little deeper than the level in which these slabs lay, the clear height of the box was slightly less than the height of the side slabs, about only Y2 The question of whether the box was closed with a complete lid at the time of its construction is not easy to decide. However, there were real cover plates in some places; at the NE end one of them protruded 50 mm beyond the side wall. A regular covering may also be assumed at the SW. end, but in the middle the debris appears to be partially 1) According to the map of the Reichs-Marine-Amtes of 1893, the declination for 1895 at Helgoland is 13° W., the annual decline is 7-8 minutes.


Page 518

 of the NW long side, which had just been destroyed here, to have fallen into the box and thus only inadvertently covered the contents of the grave. All in all, everything that I picked up as covering parts, taken together, was hardly sufficient to form a complete lid, and this conviction, which already forced itself on me during the excavation, seemed to find support in what Mrs. Hahn later reported to me independently about the Moderberg, which, however, contradicts the positive statements of Mr. Botter (above pp. 510-11).  After lifting the covering slabs, a skeleton was found in the box, not straight in the middle, but moved over to the SE, half lying on its right side, with its head hard against the SE wall, its face not turned upwards, but to the SE. The head protruded 190 mm from the SW end of the inner chamber. The remaining space, 1620 mm, was not quite sufficient to accommodate the body stretched out straight; presumably for this reason the knees were pulled up a little, or vice versa: since the legs bent in a little when the body was laid down, there was no need to take care to move the head all the way to the SW. end. I would hardly assume that the pulling up of the knees was intentional, as with the "lying stools" of the Stone Age; the bend was probably not strong enough for that. If one man carried the body at the head end and another at the foot end by reaching under the hollow of the knees, the weight of the torso must naturally have caused the body to be shortened as it was found, as no effort was apparently made to stretch it out again after it had been laid down. The right hand rested on the lower right thigh, the left was leaning over the right forearm against the SE wall. Above the left shoulder, next to the head, lay the bronze blade of a small dagger, the point at the shoulder, the end of the handle to the SW, with a rivet belonging to it. A bronze needle was found diagonally on the chest, with the head at the bottom right and the point towards the left shoulder. That was all there was in the way of grave goods; nothing of gold, as in the Moderberg. On the other hand, here and there brownish masses with traces of threads indicated decomposed clothing. In various places on the bones, especially on the head and feet, one noticed peculiar concretions, light brownish, grainy, but partly mixed with small crystals. Through analysis, I determined that it was only gypsum, which had been deposited here as sinter trickling down from the cover plates. The following picture (Fig. 4), partly based on a photograph by Mr. Fried erichs, partly on lead pen sketches by the anatomical draughtsman, Mr. W. Winter, of Werner & Winter in Frankfurt a. M., illustrates the position of the skeleton with its 'grave goods' in the box. The front corner of the box faces north, which is where the observer should be placed.  As the lid of the box was not complete, or had not provided sufficient resistance, the box was partly filled with clay, which made it very difficult to expose the skeleton and the bronzes. The bones were also very rotten, and the head, left shoulder and pelvis were crushed by stone slabs. The joint head of the left upper arm showed a decomposition I had never seen before, in that a kind of soft, snow-white chalk containing phosphoric acid was found inside the outer, thin cortical substance. Given the sad state of the skeleton, whose most characteristic parts had just been destroyed, it seemed almost impossible to determine the sex on the basis of purely anatomical features. However, Dr. Mewius, physician and physicist on Heligoland, believed that


Page 519

 The thickness of the skullcap fragments led me to conclude that it was male, and Mr. R. Virchow, to whom I presented the bones previously hardened with glue water, agreed, partly because of the thickness of various bones, including the parts of the calvaria, and partly because of the conspicuously strongly developed cancellous part in the latter. - Only one tooth was found, Figure 4, but unfortunately it fell into the hands of a stranger and I have not yet succeeded in recovering it. - The length of the skeleton could not be measured, mainly because of the destruction of individual parts of it, e.g. the feet, but also because of the shortening caused by its peculiar position. The height from the head of the hip joint to the top of the head was about 79 cm, so that one can only conclude that the man was of medium height.  With regard to the bronzes, there is little to add to the following illustrations (Fig. 5).  Figure 5."/, "*ll The dagger blade is 116 mm long, but somewhat crumbled at the end of the handle, i.e. shortened. The edges are somewhat concave, the central rib, which extends almost to the tip of the blade, is narrow and slightly rounded. The handle


Page 520

 must have been made of wood or other organic material and must have been completely lost. It was probably attached to the blade by several rivets; however, only one has been found, a four-sided peg, 12-13 mm long, the ends of which have been widened into small heads by hammering. - The pin, apparently used to gather the garment over the chest, 175 mm long, seems to have had a flat, disc-shaped (or inversely conical?) head of about 17 mm in diameter, as far as the strong weathering indicates. It is not possible to say whether the edge of the head was decorated with small, vertical right notches or with horizontal grooves running all around it. The shaft section at the top of the head is cross-ribbed (ring-shaped notches). The ribs are sharp-edged, sloping down to both sides in the shape of a roof; their number cannot be determined as the lower limit of the notch cannot be determined due to weathering. The tip of the shaft is slightly curved, whether this is intentional or merely coincidental will be discussed in the following section on "sabre needles".  The bronzes had suffered greatly from oxidation and were barely cohesive. Following a suggestion by Dr. Mewius, I poured kerosene over them in situ and succeeded in removing them quite intact. But already on the way to Berlin, the kerosene cover was cracked, probably due to trapped moisture, and pieces of the weathered bronze came loose. I therefore immersed the objects completely in melted, rather strongly heated kerosene, whereby water escaped with lively foaming, then took them out of the still hot liquid, let them drip off well and finally cooled them down on tissue paper. The pieces have kept reasonably well so far (4% months) and it is worth mentioning that they have a natural matt, non-shiny appearance. Further tests on freshly dug bronzes, but also on dry, powdery disintegrating bronzes would be desirable; the time of observation is still too short for a final judgment.  We turn to the dating of the grave. The nature of the furnishings again suggests an older Bronze Age, and the dagger, whose handle was not yet made of bronze but of organic material and did not sit on a tang, fits in very well with this, also in terms of its small size. I often found such weapons in the older graves on Amrum.  It is more difficult to find an analog for the needle. In Denmark, according to Sophus Müller, "Ordning", H, 119-22, bronze needles with handle and head are quite rare in the Early Bronze Age and belong to the younger section of the same period. The needle with a disc-shaped head, 122, is a third shorter than ours and has only an angular bead below the head instead of the more extensive transverse ribbing. This only specimen from Denmark comes from a male grave (body in stone box) on the island of Mors in Liimfjord, i.e. the NW. Jutland (Aarböger f. n. 0. 1868, 108, no. 35; 1891, 204, find 120). This needle form is not uncommon in still iron-free cremation cemeteries in the province of Brandenburg; the Königl. Museum für Völkerkunde and the Märkisches Provinzial Museum both possess some specimens from various sites (cf. e.g. "Nachrichten über Deutsche Alterthumsfunde" 1891, p. 93, Fig. 29). However, these tools are only very distantly analogous to the Heligoland object.  Friderico-Francisceum, 1837, Pl. 24, 13, from Meklenburg is more similar, but nothing is known about the circumstances of the find. A needle from Gross-Dobra in Bohemia, made from a stone cone with mortuary firing, is even better, along with other bronzes (sickle, bracelet) and clay vessels; its shaft is also

 curved, but more grooved at the top than notched (Pi'c, Archaeologicky Vyzkum ve Stredmch Cechach, i.e. Archaeolog. Forschungen im mittleren Böhmen, Prague 1893, pl. 9, 2). A similar specimen, but with a straight shaft, Pamätky archaeo logicke a mistopisne, Prague, XII, pl. 8, 1. Other needles show a slight swelling at some distance from the head, which is then grooved or notched; ibid. figs. 2 and 3 and XIV, pl. 1, 12, 13, 17, 19. I am not in a position to determine the age of all these pieces. In the south, it would probably be the most likely to expect to find veritable analogs. According to Naue, Bronzezeit in Oberbayern, Munich 1894, the strong notching would speak for a somewhat younger date; the needles of the older period, like his on Pl. 29, 8, are only weakly grooved in Upper Bavaria; at least these are comparable to ours. Echoes can also be found in Switzerland.  The sex of the burial, presumably male according to the anatomical findings reported above, cannot be determined from the grave goods, as the needles were worn by both sexes and in the older Bronze Age, as has long been known, daggers are also often found in safe women's graves (cf. the compilation by Mestorf, Corresp.-Bl. d. Deutsch, anthrop. Ges. 1889, 150).  It is noteworthy that no amber was found in the small mountain or in the Moder mountain, although it is still occasionally thrown from the sea on the dune. On the occurrence of amber in Bronze Age graves on the Cimbrian peninsula and the North Frisian Islands, see this Verh. 1890, pp. 273-74, 275-280. Before we leave the small mountain, it must be pointed out that it may well contain other graves. Not only would there be room for a second Bronze Age burial at the same altitude as the one uncovered, but there could also be things to be found at greater depths; for the floor slabs of our box were not yet lying on the old grass surface which the test shaft exposed. I intend to resume the investigation, at the risk of being unsuccessful. - The origin of the gypsum slabs requires special examination. Gypsum is sparsely distributed in the rock of the main island and, according to Wiebel, p. 91, fibrous, shiny as atlas, slightly reddish in color from the iron oxide of the clay between which it lies, in thin layers 1 - l'/3 inches thick. Wiebel only encountered it twice, once on the east side and once on the SW side near the Bakhorn. This bakhorn is now close to the old lighthouse, the fire beacon, and one might therefore be tempted to regard the gypsum slabs of our graves as having been taken from there. However, they are not reddish and are only slightly fibrous and atlas-shiny, perhaps too thick and large to justify this assumption. Naturally, our gaze is drawn to the lost Wittkliff. Ranzau only said that it supplied "calcem", but Knobloch already spoke more generally of "lime-white stones" and Lass stated on p. 39 that it supplied "a lot of Gibs and Kalck stones". Among the submarine reefs located in the NW extension of the dune, there is one that today bears the name "Wittkliff Well". Wiebel considered this location indicated on his map to be the one on which the old Wittkliff stood (pp. 100-101). He found limestone here, between whose layers thin layers of a sometimes fibrous, sometimes dense gypsum were embedded, and he considered the gypsum of the Wittkliff to be fibrous according to a remark by Bottich (cf. p. 168, note). Wiebel finally came to the conclusion that the Wittkliff had a larger extension towards the island. - Meyn, on the other hand, substantiated this view in detail,


Page 522

 that the Wittkliff consisted only of gypsum, not also of limestone (Viertel jahrs-Schrift, pp. 47-48; Geologie Helgoland's, pp. 6-10, 19). Since nothing was known of a gypsum cliff in the reefs, and the location of the Wittkliff well, which was far out, did not match the old illustrations of the Wittkliff (probably by Meyer 1649), he searched for the location of the latter on the present dune itself. Here he found fragments of the common, scaly, grainy gypsum, flat, sharp-edged, not much rolled blocks, obviously originating from a cliff that had collapsed on the spot. If Meyn, "Geologie", p. 13, nevertheless speaks of the reefs associated with the western cliff, one may believe that he is looking for the hitherto missing gypsum base of the former Witt Cliff under the sand, which represents the outermost extension of the present dune itself to the north. - Meyn assumes that the gypsum of the Wittkliff was also used extensively on the Oberland, for example as gypsum mortar, as found in older buildings, but also as building blocks, as the pieces of gypsum found on the dune are similar to the granular blocks found in many places in old walls in the Oberland. Hallier, p. 70, already suspected that the gypsum slabs of the Moderberg originated from the Wittkliff, and we may attribute those of the "small mountain" to the same source. However, it seems to me that the location of the former Wittkliff has not yet been clarified. The fact that Bötticher describes it as a protection against westerly winds (pp. 263-64) speaks against Meyn, whereas according to its location in Meyer's work, it must have covered the dune and especially the stone rampart more against northerly and especially northeasterly winds. Bötticher, who still had the last remnants of the cliff and the stone rampart in front of him, could hardly have been mistaken. So perhaps Meyer's map should not be given much weight with regard to the location of the Wittkliff and the otherwise certainly not too accurate outline of the island from 1713 (see p. 505) may indicate it more correctly. Wiebel's view would agree well with this.  In any case, one can say with Camerer, p. 6: "It would certainly be desirable for curiosity to investigate the areas around this rock more closely1)". - The result of our investigation so far is proof that the Early Bronze Age is represented in graves on Heligoland. But we can establish an even earlier settlement of the island. In the "Nachrichten über deutsche Alterthumsfunde" 1892, p. 92, 2 flint axes were illustrated, which were brought to light during the current fortification work at various places on the Oberland. Both belong to one and the same, rather clumsy type. A third flint axe, but of a different shape, flat and thin, sharpened only on the broad sides, is in the collection of the well-known ornithologist Mr. Heinrich Gätke. Finally, I know of a fourth stone axe2) from Heligoland, 1) Coincidentally, Prof. W. Dam es from Berlin stayed there for the purpose of geological studies while I was on the island. He has since published the results of these studies (see literature above) and also discussed the Witte Kliff on p. 1027. He assigns it to the Triassic formation, more precisely to the middle Muschelkalk, the anhydrite group, and adheres to Wiebel's view with regard to its location. He describes the gypsum as follows: "light gray and white, dense, with foliated portions, also probably coarsely foliated alone and interspersed with thin layers of a gray-greenish clay. The rock is probably a mixture of anhydrite and gypsum."  2) It was found after the fire of a house caused by a lightning strike "when clearing rubble", so perhaps during the foundation trench of the new building. The current owner, who I believe received it from his father, considered it to have been found at that time.


Page 523

 which again is of a different kind, i.e. in shape and size similar to Madsen, Steenalderen, Copenhagen 1868, Pl. 30, 4, only not quite as pointed at the end of the band, and probably consists of diorite, dark-colored overall, but with a lighter groundmass and black hornblende veins. So we have 4 axes in 2 different types of stone and 3 different shapes. In addition, there is the splinter I found of a sharpened flint tool, presumably an axe or a chisel, as well as the fragment of a crescent-shaped knife or saw made of flint in Mr. Gätke's possession, such as Mestorf, Yorgeschichtl. Alterth. aus Schleswig-Holstein, Hamburg 1885, Fig. 27, or Sophus Müller, Stenalderen, Copenhagen 1888, Figs. 138 and 139. 138 and 139. Finally, splinters or shavings that may have been manufactured were already mentioned in the "Nachrichten"; according to information provided by Dr. K. Hagen, the Hamburg Museum also possesses the only prehistoric artifact from the island under No. 512, an almost 4 cm long, 2 cm wide fragment of a flint tooth, found on the Oberland.  The Stone Age is therefore beyond doubt for Heligoland. In terms of shape and material, it differs in nothing from that of the mainland; however, the assumption that the better-worked pieces were also imported from here is unprovable. Flint nodules, partly from the Cretaceous surrounding Heligoland, are found in masses on the dune island, as are many small boulders of crystalline rocks, and larger ones of the same type are found on the Oberland (cf. Wiebel, pp. 143-44, 181 note). I do not know whether diorite has been found among them, but otherwise diorite is not uncommon among the Nordic boulders. It is therefore quite conceivable that all the finds mentioned were made on the island itself, but the connection between the stone age culture of the island and that of the mainland is obvious.  If, therefore, our knowledge of the oldest stages of the cultural development of our regions, although limited, is nevertheless well-founded for Heligoland, there is no definite evidence for the subsequent periods, the later Bronze Age and the pre-Roman and Roman Iron Age. The "urns" from the Bredberg, presumably from post-burials, could belong to any of these three cultural periods, but cannot be dated for lack of more detailed information. - As Prof. Wilh. Krause pointed out to me, the passage in Tacitus' Annals II, 23-24 has been interpreted as meaning that Germanicus was sent to Heligoland in 16 AD. When, after a campaign in Germania, he wanted to lead the greater part of his army down the Ems to Schill', but the fleet was scattered by a southerly storm with a simultaneous ebb current "into the open ocean and towards islands with rugged cliffs or hidden shoals," only one of them landed on the shores of the Chauken (i.e. in East Friesland). Germanicus' trireme, "who, staying on the cliffs and the shore tops, when he blamed himself for such a great misfortune, could hardly be prevented by his friends from seeking death in the same sea" until he reached the mainland again with a favorable wind and the tidal current. Since some of the ships themselves were carried as far as Britain, lightning fell from the sky as a "thunderbolt" - the first time I have come across such a legend, often told in books, concerning a stone ship in my own practice. The dimensions of the piece are: Length 154, largest width, close to the cutting edge, 59, thickness 35 mm.


Page 524

 If the cliffs were mentioned, it is of course possible that one of them also reached our island. But I don't think there is any other evidence that it was inhabited by Chauks, and the mere mention of the cliffs is not enough to identify Heligoland with certainty, no matter how easy it is for someone tired of life to jump into the depths here. There is talk of (several) islands, not just one, with rugged cliffs, although the latter are not to be found anywhere else on this coast. You shouldn't take this too seriously; anyone who plunges into the surf could die in many places on the East Frisian Islands and the mainland. In any case, there is no reason to think that this short, involuntary stay of a single ship would have left any traces on the island. Products characteristic of the Roman period could only have arrived here through trade.  Our knowledge of the post-Roman period is no better. However, Sachs reports on p. 240: "Osterteich, after Eyderstädt, still had a church, as the same place is still called today, the old farms or churchyards, and all kinds of household utensils, fountains, gold and silver coins have been found there". But "Osterteich" only means the eastern side of the cliffs on the dune, or the eastern cliff features there, since Sachs immediately beforehand compares the cliffs with a natural "pond (dyke) or rampart". Wiebel is therefore obviously right to understand these old churchyards as the submarine reef "Olde Höven" in the extension of the dune, where the churchyard for shipwrecked people, which has now been moved elsewhere, used to be located on the dune. - A note in Knobloch p. 17 would be more interesting if it could be related to the earliest times of Christianity on the island. "Under the Radeburg (i.e. the Roadberg) in the northern harbor (when a piece of the land there, or from the old churchyard, as this place is therefore called) various golden, silver, even brass coins and derogleichen are found: Whereby it must be assumed that the people of former times gave the deceased money into the grave when they were to be buried."  - The old churchyard referred to here can be found on Meyer's map NW next to the Radbodberg. Lass relocates Radbod's grave there himself. However, since none of the finds from this site have survived, we cannot go any further. The only remaining prehistoric or early historical object from the time after Christ is the golden wrist ring described in our Verhandl. 1893, pp. 24-25, where unfortunately the characteristic "hourglass" ornament has not been correctly reproduced. (See Discussion at the end.) Because of Heligoland's isolated location in the middle of a very turbulent sea, the high number of connections to the plague land may be striking. The ships of the Stone Age could not be considered capable of crossing the arm of water that now lies between the island and the mainland. So the first question is whether the distance between the two was essentially the same then as it is today. The fanciful extent that was previously attributed to the red rock of the island has been rejected by science, as has the assumption of a large marshland connected to the rock, but L. Meyn, who knew the conditions of these coastal areas very well, wrote in his treatise "Zur Geologie Helgo lands" p. 14: "I maintain that H. undoubtedly once, and indeed in the times of the most recent period of earth formation still lasting today, i.e. geologically speaking in historical times - whether otherwise in historical times I cannot say - much more than the island itself.


Page 525

 larger than today, but that this island was not a larger rocky island at that time, nor a marsh formation leaning against the rock, but a geest island of the same nature as Sylt and one half of Föhr, a geest island from which the red layered rock and the snow-cracked massive gypsum rock of the Witten Kliff protruded." Furthermore, p. "24: "I can state with full certainty that where the dune is now located, a larger geest island was gradually destroyed and that this island consisted of a sandy Tertiary formation with a diluvial clay cover". (Cf. also Vierteljahrs-Schrift, p. 49.) I do not know whether Meyn's assumption, insofar as it concerns the existence of a larger geest island at all, has already been carefully examined and accepted or rejected by other geologists. (That such an island rested on a tertiary foundation is disputed by Dames p. 1036, who attributes the sand of the dune rather to the Diluvium, and thus, just like the erratic blocks of the Oberland, to the Quaternary period; and if he also describes Heligoland geologically on p. 1039 as an advanced position of German, not English soil, this refers to times so infinitely far back that they are not even relevant for us). - On his new draft of Meyer's map for 1649, Geerz noted: "the Unterland was formerly much larger than it is now", but by this he only meant that the largest (south-eastern) part of the Nordhafen was formerly (and indeed for the entire 16th century) land, as the map indicates. In no other direction did he think that the land once extended considerably further than it does now.  If, however, one denies that the island was much larger in any way, there is still the possibility that the mainland or other islands off it extended much further. However, Geerz's historical maps again show that no changes to the mainland coast and the North Frisian Islands can be proven that would be relevant to our question. The most significant demolition concerns the island of Nordstrand, most of which sank in 1634. The westernmost part of Nordstrand, however, was previously formed by the present island of Pellworm; this change is therefore of no significance to us, as Pellworm is by no means the most advanced western line of the entire coast. - Certain landfalls are recorded off Amrum, but these do not extend very far; Geerz expressly denies a closer connection between Amrum and Heligoland. - According to Geerz, the nearest mainland coast (the Eiderstedt peninsula in Schleswig) was always about 6 geographic miles away from Heligoland, and no land is indicated for the coasts along the Elbe estuary that significantly narrowed the separating arm of the sea. Major land losses in earlier times are therefore conceivable, but cannot be proven. We must therefore now investigate whether the island may have been accessible in the earliest times, even if it was at the same distance from the nearest land. Adam von Bremen apparently denies that Heligoland was even known at all times.  For he reports that Bishop Eilbert was the first to rediscover it (in the 11th century) and make it habitable: "Eilbertum tradunt insulam primum reperisse, constructoque monasterio in ea fecisse habitabilem .... Hanc in vita Sancti "VVilli brordi Fosetisland apellari didicimus". The fact that Adam himself refers to knowledge of the island in Willibrord's time (around 700) shows, however, that he was only thinking of a temporary unfamiliarity with the island (cf. v. d. Decken p. 117). But this too must be disputed as far as the inhabitants of the nearest coasts are generally concerned.


Page 526

 Various revisions of Adam's work have been provided with scholia, the greater number of which are considered to have originated with Adam himself In any case, scholia 104 to lib. 4, cap. 3, which is found in a fragment of a good codex from the 11th or early 12th century, can only be slightly younger than Adam's "gesta" (Lappenberg in Monum. vol. 9, p. 273, 274, 369 and in the introduction to Laurent's translation p. XIII). Unfortunately, it is badly mutilated.  According to Lappenberg's addition, reproduced below in cursive, it reads: "wici'na est [insula] Fresoreu?" terra vel nostre W "rrahe, ita quod. "deri possii iacere super mare", i.e. "the island lies close to the land of the Frisians and our Wirraha (Weser), so that it can be seen lying across the sea."  Even if the addition is not correct, Lappenberg's reading contains a clue as to how Adam can be refuted. For if the island could be seen from the Weser (and indeed, since the telescope was only invented around 1600, with the naked eye, even if perhaps only under particularly favorable circumstances), the knowledge of this fact, which was extremely important for the inhabitants of the mainland coast, would certainly never have been lost on them, even if the island remained invisible for decades. We therefore have to examine whether Lappenberg's reading can be correct at all in terms of content.  The Weser estuary certainly includes the area of the "red sand", where the lighthouse was built 10-12 years ago, which is now generally regarded as the sea border, even though there is no longer any solid land there. The island of Wangeroog can also be safely included. According to the chart of the Hydrographic Office of the Admiralty of 1886, however, the "Rothen-Sand-Thurm" lies 20.7 and the Wangeroog lighthouse 23.4 nautical miles at 1855 m, i.e. 38.4 and 43.4 km from the Helgoland tower. If one now theoretically calculates the limit of visibility of the upper rocky edge of the island, one will of course not get that far. I owe the following simple formula for calculating this distance to Dr. Förster, Director of the Berlin Observatory: E = 113 - ]/ h + h1 where h and h1 are the heights of the object and the eye in kilometers.  If one now assumes with Wiebel the highest point of the rock1) to be 55.5 m or about 55 m and sets the height of the eye of an observer, for example in a small ship, to -4 m, then h + h1 = 0.059, \ h + h1 = 0.2429, thus E = 27.44 km. - However, E would be larger if the observer had an elevated viewpoint. This could be a dune on Wangeroog, for example, as there was no lighthouse there around 1100. Now the survey sheet of the Königl. Preuss. Landesaufnahme of 1891, published in 1892, at a scale of 1:25,000, indicates Wangeroog's dunes at a height of up to 14 meters. If one adds around 2 m from foot to eye, then h' = 0.01 (J, h + h1 = 0.071, V h + h1 = 0.26646 and E = 30.1 km. According to the calculation, even the uppermost edge of the rock would not be visible from Wangeroog for a long time. - 1) Schumacher found the height of the beacon in 1824 to be 243.5 Hamburg feet or 69.8 m above the sea (Wiebel p. 72). The maps of the Admiralty of 1885 and the Reichs-Marine-Amtes of 1890 and 1893 set the height = 68.5 meters. The fire therefore towers 14.3-13.0 m above the rock. Nevertheless, according to these charts, it is only visible for 20 nautical miles. This must be due to the low intensity of the light, as can also be seen from the comparison with the fires on Amrum and Sylt (red cliff), which, according to the 1893 map, reach further than the Helgoland one despite their lower height.


Page 527

 Various writers have described the visibility of the island from a great distance as follows:  Mushard says, following information from the Helgoland pastor Edlefsen, in the.  Hannoverisches Magazin, Jahrgang 2 für 1764, p. 1105: "The Oberland presents itself at five or six miles like a coffin in the sea", and Niemann speaks in his "Handbuch" p. 203 of the first sight "still more than five miles away from it". v. d. Decken goes somewhat less far on p. 5: "At a distance of five miles, the Heligoland Rock appeared only as a small black dot on the horizon." - This information therefore varies between 5 and 6 German miles at 7420 m, i.e. between 37.1 and 44.5 km, and according to this, one would probably still have to be able to see Heligoland from the red sand and from Wangeroog if the sea level of the eye were massive. In fact, Mr. Janssen, the head of the municipality of Wangeroog, kindly informed me that in very clear weather you can see the rock of Heligoland from a dune on this island. The explanation for this fact obviously lies in the so-called "Kimmung" or mirage, i.e. the elevation of the image of the island caused by refraction and reflection on the part of the unevenly heated and therefore unevenly dense layers of air according to known physical laws. On the basis of this observation1) , however, we are forced to assume that the indigenous population around the mouth of the Weser was aware of the existence of the island at all times, and if we do not want to assume that Adam, as a local stranger who had immigrated from the inland, was unaware of this fact by chance, then a special interpretation must be sought for the passage about Eilbert. It must either mean that E. restored the Christian cult - which St. Willibrord (around 700) is said to have tried to introduce there first, then with more luck St. Liudger (end of the 8th century); cf. Wiebel, p. 15, note -j- - or that E. reopened the traffic with the island, which may have been interrupted due to warlike incidents.  One may well think here with v. d. Decken, p. 118, of the Vikings; after all, very close to the harbor at Steenodde on Amrum is a large burial ground of the 9th century, which I have investigated, and which certainly belonged to a seafaring population and, in addition to numerous weapons, provided those characteristic Nordic, oval, bowl-shaped fibulae2).  If, according to our investigations, the island has been known from time immemorial, an attempt will have been made early on in calm weather, 1) Incidentally, this could already be deduced from the visibility of Wangeroog from the Heligoland Rock. For from the member \ h -fh1 in the formula given, it is clear that it is quite the same whether the eye and the object exchange their altitudes or not.  2) Graves from the Viking period can still be found several times in the coastal regions of Holstein, Oldenburg and East Frisia, not to mention the Netherlands. However, it is doubtful whether they belong to the raiding foreigners or to the local population itself. I mention here the burial ground of Immenstedt in Süder-Dithmarschen, situated quite far into the country (Mittheilungen des anthrop. Verein in Schleswig-Holstein, Heft I, Kiel 1888). Furthermore, the places Wildeshausen and Holzhausen near W. in Oldenburg, also far into the country, but situated on the Hunte, which is still navigable there; then Gummelstede and Haddien, Amt Jever; all 4 sites are represented in the Oldenburg Museum, partly by stirrups of the oldest form, as at Immenstedt and Steenodde, partly by the characteristic swords (No. 1, 2, 5), finally by urns "of the Frisian type", i.e. without a standing surface, as at Steenodde. Finally, reference should be made to the grave in the Upstallsboom mound near Aurich (Zeitschr. f. Ethnol. 1890, 35).


Page 528

 and the finds show that navigation was sufficiently developed for this purpose. Of course, the difference in the art of shipbuilding and nautical engineering then and now will be no less than that in the equipment of the warriors, as shown by the tiny dagger of the hero who rose from the dead on August 30, 1993 after almost three thousand years of rest, in contrast to the terrible guns whose mighty barrels stare menacingly at the enemy from armored towers of the latest construction in the immediate vicinity. - Mr. C. F. Lehmann asks whether the golden ring presented by Dr. Lindemann could not have come from a burial mound that had fallen from the cliff into the sea? - Mr. Olsbausen admits this possibility if it was found close to the shore, for example in the harbour, which he does not remember exactly; at the same time, however, he points out that this ring belongs to a completely different time (about the 9th century AD) than the grave he opened'). - (24) Mr. Olshausen talks about sabre needles.  Klopfleisch found bronze needles in skeleton graves at Thierschneck, Saxony-Meininge, "which were bent downwards at the tips like sabres" (Förstemann's Neue Mitth. aus dem Gebiet der histor.-antiq. Forschung vol. 14, 1878, p. 557; catalog of the Berlin prehist. Ausstellung 1880, Suppl. No. 90, 91; cf. Correspondenzblatt der Deutschen anthrop. Gesellschaft p. 77-78). Tischler called these tools, which are also found in gold, "sabre needles" (Diese Verh. 1886, 470; Sitzungsberichte der phys.-öcono Gesellschaft Königsberg, 1888, p. 6). Finally, I discussed them in detail in Verh. 1886, pp. 487-88, and described them, according to the mat known at that time, as needles with a round2), slightly curved near the mostly blunt tip 1) Mr. Botter was subsequently able to find out about the circumstances and location of the find: Lindemann's statement, Yerliandl. 1893, p. 24 - according to which the bing was taken out of the sea by a Heligoland fisherman about a mile east of the island while fishing in a net at the beginning of the 1940s, should be modified somewhat. Mr. Botter knew Mr. Franz Bauch as the finder, whom he had a friend question. The answer is: "In the summer of 1862 I found the bracelet between the dune and. Helgoland, east of the place where sloops lie. A Dutch tjalk sailed here years ago and sank at that spot. The bottom of the ship is still there and from this bottom I found, or rather fished out, the bracelet: it was about 2 fathoms (12 feet) of water above the bottom of the ship. In good weather and clear water I could recognize almost every object on the bottom and so I noticed the bracelet. It is safe to assume that it came from the Dutch ship. In the course of the summer I sold it to Dr. v. Aschen." - Accordingly, the wrist ring cannot be regarded as an old Heligoland item.  However, I would consider it to be old, found in Holland, for example in a terpe, one of those artificial hills on which houses are built to protect them from flooding and which are rich in antiquities from different periods.  2) Whether the shaft is always round and not sometimes angular became doubtful to me later in view of the drawings in Pamatky archaeologicke a mistopisne XI, Prague 1881, Pl. 14, Figs. 21, 22, 26, 27; unfortunately the text says nothing about this, as Prof. Dr. A. Brückner kindly informed me himself.


Page 529

 shaft and an eyelet or ring-like device of some kind at the outermost end of the head. - There is no doubt that the curvature is intentional, and it is essential that it is limited only to the part just before the point.  Needles in which the curvature extends further up the shaft or is absent before the tip, but occurs in the middle part of the shaft, should in any case be treated with caution and sometimes give rise to the suspicion that they are merely accidental bends. Thus the term was, in my opinion, incorrectly applied to the Hungarian piece in this Verh. 1892, p. 573, Fig. 9. So only pieces with the described curvature can be described as "sabre needles", at least as long as one adheres to the particular type that Klopfleisch, Tischler and I had in mind and which is found in graves of the oldest Bronze Age, Tischler's period Pile-Leubingen. The question is, however, whether all needles with such a curvature really belong to it. I know of 2 or 3 specimens which, although they have the bend, do not fully meet my definition. These are: one from Warszenko, see Lissauer, Alterthümer der Bronzezeit in Westpreussen, Danzig 1891, plate 2,2, called Säbelnadel in the text without reservation; furthermore the one from Helgoland and much more easily the one from Gross-Dobra in Bohemia (Pi'c, Archaeologicky Vyzkum ve Stredm'ch Oechach, i.e. Archaeologicky Vyzkum ve Stredm'ch Oechach). i.e. Archaeological Research in Central Bohemia, Prague 1893, plate 9.2 on p. 68, from a stone cone with mortuary firing next to clay vessels and other bronzes). Of these needles, according to Lissauer's definite statement, repeated to me orally, the one from Warszenko reliably possesses the intentional curvature of the required type; in the case of the other two, the intentionality of the bend is doubtful, especially in the case of the one from Dobra, as it extends somewhat far upwards here. (For an illustration of the Helgoland pin, see p. 519 above.) The "Warszenkoer Nadel" comes from a grave of the Peccatel period according to Tischler (Montelius Per. 11 +III; S. Müller's BronzezeitI, 1 and 2). The upper part of the shaft with the head is bent at a right angle and lies horizontally with the remaining part of the shaft in a vertical position. The head has no eyelet, but there is one at the bend of the shaft, i.e. at the same height as the head, so that, practically speaking, the Warszenko needle is on a par with the older sabre needles. Nevertheless, Jentzsch objected to the term sabre needle for this piece (Sitzungsberichte d. physik.-öcon. Ges. 1892, 31-32), partly because it is younger and came to light outside the previously known distribution area of sabre needles, partly because Tischler had already introduced the term "Oehsen needles" for tools with this formation of the upper part of the shaft (ibid. 1887, 13; 1890, 21). Lissauer refrained from mentioning this here, but he was well aware of Tischler's term "Oehsennadeln", because he himself applied it to a very similar needle Fig. 7 from the same grave, about the tip of whose shaft, since it is lost, nothing is known. For Lissauer, therefore, only the curvature of the shaft tip, Fig. 2, was decisive for the designation, not the upper bend of the shaft, which again Jentzsch seems to have overlooked. However, I would like to agree with the latter insofar as it is better to retain the names once they have been introduced, as long as it is a single exception. Of course, the appearance of new combinations may force us to change the nomenclature. Such a combination would also be, apart from the Li ss shown in Fig. 2, the Helgoland and Gross-Dobra needles, which have no oehse at all. On the other hand, there may be needles with oehse and otherwise completely in the shape of the old sabre needles, but without the curvature of the tip, according to Pamatky XIII, Pl. 2,27, which is compared with the sabre needle, Fig. 26, on the Verhandl, der Berl, Anthropol. Society 1893. 34

 chest of one and the same skeleton (Fig. 24). However, if all needles with a curved tip are to be called sabre needles, then all needles with oehsen would also be called oehsen needles, as in Fig. 27 and no less all old sabre needles themselves. Furthermore, if age and local occurrence are disregarded, then the very large implements of Baden and Switzerland with oehsen, which I used for comparison (Verh. 1886, 412-13), could also be called sabre needles if they have the curvature in front of the point (Forrer's Antiqua 1886, pl. 7,3; Verhandl. 1886, 83, 374, 411; 1887, 97, 140), especially as they may have had the same use despite their size. This brings us to the intended purpose of our needles, as it results from their position on the corpse names.  The Helgoland piece lay across the chest, the head at the bottom right, the tip at the top left. This low position of the head is not without precedent. I do not know of any from the north at the moment; in the Early Bronze Age, needles played a minor role here, but a very important one in the south. Thus Scheidemandel, Hügelgräber bei Parsberg i. d. bayr. Oberpfalz, P. 1886, p. 7, reports of 2 very long bronze needles with head disk, without oehse (Taf. V, 1), which were found with the heads pointing downwards across the chest of a skeleton. However, such an arrangement is not common for this type of pin; to stay with Bavaria, Naue found them in the older Bronze Age on the chest with the head facing upwards, or even horizontally (Bronze Age in Upper Bavaria, Munich 1894, Pl. 5, 6)1). In contrast, the position with the head pointing more or less downwards is, it seems, more common in pieces that have eyelets or, instead of these, perforations on the swollen neck.  Already Verhandl. 1886, 487-88, I pointed out that the above-mentioned needles Pamätky XIII, Pl. 2, 26 and 27 were found in a similarly oblique position with the heads on the right2) below, and Naue observed 2 needles, one with its eye-like head, the other with the rolled head pointing slightly downwards, close under the neck of the corpse (Pl. 7); furthermore needles with a perforated, swollen neck on the chest with the head pointing vertically downwards (Pl. 8,1), all of this in the Early Bronze Age. Naue found the remnant of a thread in the perforation of one of them and assumes that such needles were attached to clothing (p. 19, 51, 154; cf. Strobel, diese Verh. 1890, 328). Popp and Oehsen had already given such an interpretation to the perforations. The same may have been the case with the sabre needles, and since the Helgoland specimen is characterized by 1) Popp, Grabhügel hei Amberg in Bayern, Ingolstadt 1821, forms on Tat'. 3 seven different types of needles, some without, some with holes or eyelets on the shaft and with various head formations, including several "plates" perpendicular to the shaft, but also a so-called wheel in the plane of the shaft. According to p. 29, "the needles" were found several times "in such a way that they reached from the very top of the breast (where the plate was) to the armpit (where the point was): The breastbone, collarbone and armpit were colored by the green rust". According to this, the pinhead was located just below the neck, i.e. at least as high, but probably higher, than the tip at the armpit, and Tischler therefore only erroneously claimed that the "wheel-shaped heads" were located downwards (Beiträge zur Anthropo logie und Urgesch. Bayerns, 4, 1881, p. 51; Naue, Bronzezeit, p. 61, note 2).  2) If the needles are not vertical, the head usually appears to be on the right; this is also the case in Sehested, Archaeologiske Undersögelser, Kopenh. 1884, pl. 25, 1 d to p. 128. However, sabre needles have been found several times on the left of the skeleton and then presumably also with the heads on the left (Verhandl. 1886, 487), as is the case with one of the needles in Naue, pl. 7.

 As the Parsberg needles have a swelling below the neck that allows a solid thread to be tied to them, they could have been held in the same way, especially as the weight of the downturned head must have favored the needle slipping out of the garment and thus its loss. Whether the other end of the thread was also looped around the tip of the needle, forming a kind of brooch, I will leave open. Mr. Lissauer was inclined to this view when I pointed out to him that the curvature of the shaft tip of the sabre needles could be seen as the beginning of a fibula formation. The position of all these implements at a greater or lesser height on the chest compels us to regard them as garment needles, as I have already explained earlier with regard to sabre needles, contrary to the view that they were hair ornaments, by interpreting the curvature at the tip as making it more difficult for the clothing to slip off or, in the opposite position, for the needle to slip out (Yerh. 1886, 412-13, 487-88). But also the large Baden and Swiss tools mentioned above with similar constructive parts, as well as the straight ones up to 88 cm long, not provided with eyelets, as in de Bon Stetten, Recueil d'anti quites Suisses, 1855, Pl. 3, 2 and 3 and Supplement II, 1867, pl. 5, I explained at the time as clothes pins, which seems to me to be confirmed by Naüe's observations (p. 51), who also interprets the large Bavarian straight tools in the same way.  If we now return to our Helgoland object, it turns out that typologically this piece cannot yet be proven without Oehse that its shaft curvature at the tip was intentional; for this is even less certain of the only fairly similar specimen1) from Gross-Dobra, and Pic does not mention the curvature at all in the text, so that he certainly did not notice it as intentional. However, the way in which our needle is used is so similar to that of the sabre needles that the same purpose can be assumed for the curvature of the points. Incidentally, both needles, the Helgoland and the Dobra ones, are probably younger than the actual sabre needles, which, like the Dobra ones, were never found in cremation graves. - (25) Mr. F. W. K. Müller presents a number of fabric samples showing the Javanese batik dyeing process in all its stages. These samples, together with a detailed explanatory text in Malay (with accompanying pictures drawn by a Javanese), were donated to the Royal Museum of Ethnology by Dr. Franz Benecke. The batik technique, which, like the Plangi process2) , originates from the Near East, is well known and has been described several times3) , but was not yet represented in this completeness in the local museum.  1) Perhaps Pamätky 14, p. 346, Fig. 19, with a defective tip should also be noted; again, nothing is noted about the still visible part of the curvature of the shaft.  2) Tie-dye technique.

 The individual stages were described by the Javanese as: terusan isen-isen tembokkan wedellan ngengrengan biron blirikkan sogan babarran (26) Mr. P. W. K. Müller discusses some alleged Ainu ornaments.  In the magnificently decorated work by David Mac Ritchie: The Ainos, Leiden 1892, the frontispiece is a reproduction of a Japanese painting kept in the museum of the Royal Zoological Society "Natura Artis Magistra" in Amsterdam. As Mac Ritchie considers this picture to be one of the "most important of the whole series" of the depictions he has seen and described and believes that "the ornamentations of the dresses in this picture form ... a study in themselves", the latter may be subjected to a brief examination here.  The painting depicts four Ainu men and an Ainu woman holding hands and moving forward in a bent posture. Mac Ritchie comments on the richly decorated robes of the Ainu "Notable among these [ornamentations]1) is the sun-cross [1 °] on the back of the leading figure and on the back of the left arm of the fourth man; which sun-cross again appears on the backs of two of the men in the larger picture"). This sun-cross and kindred symbols may be seen in other pictures etc ; and in the present scene one may also note, as belonging to the same species of design, the two large diced patterns [2°] in the background, and the flowered crosses of four and six points [3°] in the dresses of the two leading men. With regard, finally, to the meaning of this scene, it is obviously suggestive either of the worship of a divinity or the servile adulation of an earthly lord" [4°].  As far as the process - ad 4° - itself is concerned, it is not at all doubtful in my opinion. The Ainu do not go to worship a deity, but go to an audience with a prince3). It is also not doubtful to which prince, for on the curtain4) the coat of arms (Fig. 1) of the daimyö of Matsumaye5), to whom Yezo, i.e. the Ainu, were subordinate, is emblazoned twice.  The "sun-cross" mentioned above under 1° is shown here in Fig. 6. It is hardly an Ainu ornament but, like Figs. 7 and 8, which appear in the larger Amsterdam picture, and like Figs. 1 and 2, simply Japanese. Among the Japanese, Fig. 6 is the coat of arms of the Shimadzu (Satsuma) family, Fig. 8 of the Hisamatsu family, Fig. 7 the well-known Mitsudoyme.  1) The text in square brackets [] is an addition by the author.  2) This refers to another picture from the Amsterdam Museum.  3) Mac Eitchie correctly compares p. 44, "the tribute group in the Matsmae pano rama" and the like.  4) The curtain separates the prince from the common people.

 Prosaically, by the way, the Japanese do not see a "sun-cross" in Fig. 6, but the ring of a horse's bit1). In the Japanese Yolks encyclopaedia mentioned on p. 532, note 5, such a ring is depicted; the "cross" there is called: jü mon-ji, i.e. the Chinese character for 10 = +, the circle: kagami = mirror.  Pig. 1. fig. 2. (JTD w qXd fig. 3. fig. 4. fig. 5. © Pig. 6. pig. 7. - ?"  Pig. 8. Mac Ritchie (see above snb 2° "and 3°) places the figures reproduced here under 1, 2 and 5 in the same category as this "sun-cross". It has already been said above that Fig. 1 is the "coat of arms of the Daimyö of Matsumaye. Needless to say, the Japanese do not see a "diced pattern" in this figure, but "four eyes". This pattern is regularly called: yotsume in a small Japanese pattern book I have, and Hepburn2) confirms this statement. - I cannot count the "flowered cross" (see 3° above), shown here as Fig. 2, among the Ainu ornaments either. As a comparison with Fig. 3 shows, it is almost identical to the latter. Fig. 3, however, is a different "coat of arms of the princes of Matsumaye, the rulers of the Ainu. By placing the two coats of arms both openly and concealed, the Japanese artist has localized the process and made the picture sufficiently comprehensible without a single line of text, as is usually the case. - Incidentally, such ornaments as Figs. 2 and 3 are called "Blossoms of the climbing cucumber", as the Japanese caption to Fig. 4, a motif taken from the aforementioned pattern book, teaches us.  This leaves only Fig. 5, which I also consider to be Japanese, albeit without being able to prove it. This ornament is not to be found among the "coats of arms" illustrated by Appert, nor in the pattern books that I know.  It is most similar to the motifs called kazaguruma by the Japanese. - (27) Mr. F. W. K. Müller discusses a myth of the Kei Islanders and related subjects.  In the fourth issue of the "Bijdragen tot de taal- land- en volkenkunde van Nederlandsch Indie", 1893, Prof. Kern presents two episodes from the tradition of the Kei Islanders that are worthy of note 1) S.

As the latter author reports, objects bearing the Satsuma-Daimyö "Y" emblem are venerated and collected by believers as relics from Japan's Christian era (because of the cross!).  2) Japanese-English dictionary s. v. yotsume.

 and the Minahassaer together and remarks: "dat an eene ontleening door de Minahasser's van de Kei-eilanders of omgekeerd niet de denken valt. Both overleverings must have been developed independently from a common humanistic base, and therefore date back to a time when the leaders of the Toumbulu's and Kei-eilanders were still from one people".  In my opinion, the matter is not so simple, because how does the above explanation fit in with the fact that the same legend can already be found in the national histories of the Japanese, the Kojiki and the Nihon shoki, written down in the sixth century AD?  For a better "appreciation of the facts of the case, I will leave the three accounts below.  Tradition of the Kei Islanders [according to Riedel]1).  Three brothers, named Hian, Ton giil and Parpara, and two sisters, called Bikeel and Meslaang, once lived above the earth [in heaven].  One day Parpara went fishing on the sea of clouds with his eldest brother's fishing hook and lost the hook. [In Planten and Pleyte2): "But no sooner had he lowered the line into the "water than a huge fish bit into the bait, swallowed the hook and pulled so violently on the line that it broke; so Parpara was forced to return without fish and without hook.  Disappointed by so much adversity, he went home and informed his brother of his loss. But instead of lamenting Parpara's loss, Hian was extremely upset about the loss of his hook and demanded in a fierce tone that Parpara should get it back for him]. Hian, enraged by this, ordered him to get the hook back. Parpara got into his boat and dived into the clouds. After many fruitless efforts, he met the fish Kiliboban, who asked him what he was doing there.  Parpara told him everything and the fish promised to look for the hook. After some time, the Minahassaer [according to P. N. Wilken]3).  Kawulusan of Pasambangko wanted to fish on the sea, but as he had no fishing rod, he borrowed one from his friend. He went out to sea in a small boat to fish. He soon caught a fish, but when he tried to pull it out, the line broke and the rod was gone.  Kawu lusan returned home in a distressed mood and told his friend what had happened. "You must give me back my fishing rod; even if you give me ten others in return, I won't take them!" Now Kawulusan went back to the sea to look for the lost fishing rod. At the place where he had lost it, he jumped into the water and dived down. He soon found a paved path on the sea bed that led him to a village. In one of the houses in this village, he heard a lot of wailing and moaning, as a pig was being sacrificed for a girl who had gotten a fishbone stuck in her throat. Kawulusan, who had gone inside, immediately saw that his fishing rod was stuck in the girl's throat.  "It's nothing," he said to the parents, "I'll give her some medicine and she'll soon be well." Now he let them all go out, and when he was with the daughter 1) Riedel, De sluik- en kroesharige rassen tusschen Selebes en Papua 1886, p. 2) Bei Kern in: Bijdragen etc. 1893, p. 501. 3) in: Mededeelingen van wege het Nederlandsche Zeudelinggenootschap 1863, p. 3

 Kiliboban approached the fish Kerkeri, who was coughing repeatedly.  Kiliboban asked him what was wrong and was given permission to examine Kerkeri's throat, where he found the hook, which he brought back to Parpara. When he was alone, he carefully pulled the fishing rod out of his throat and hid it in his clothes. Kawulusan then returned with the gifts he had received from his parents. But when he got to the place where he had plunged into the water, his boat had disappeared. As he was still mourning this new misfortune, he saw a large fish. He immediately asked him with the words: "If you bring me safely to the shore, I will give you the name Pongkor sumesengkat."  Since his request was granted, he sat on the back of the fish, which shot through the water with astonishing speed, etc.  Japanese tradition [according to Chamberlain]1).  The god Hohodemi said to his elder brother, the god Hoderi: "Let us barter with each other and try each other's luck." Although he asked him three times, the elder brother would not agree, and finally, after much difficulty, the exchange was made. The god Hohodemi then tried his luck on the sea and wanted to fish.  But he never caught a fish and also lost his fishing hook in the sea. The elder brother, the god Hoderi, asked for his fishhook back, saying: "Happiness on the mountains is happiness in itself, and happiness on the sea is happiness for itself. Let us return our luck to each other."  The younger brother, the god Hohodemi, replied: "As for your fishing hook, I didn't catch a single fish with it, and in the end I lost it in the sea." But the older brother now demanded it back all the more urgently. The younger brother broke his sword, ten handbreadths long, with which he was girded, and made five hundred fishhooks to replace it, but he would not accept them. He then made a thousand fishhooks as replacements, but did not accept them, saying, "I will return my original fishhook.  [Hohodemi'-) complained to the god of salt earth. He then built him a boat, put him in it and gave him precise rules of conduct.

 the sea god's palace. Miraculously led inside, he pleased the sea god so much that he asked him to stay and eventually gave him his daughter as his wife. After spending three years in the palace, he remembered the past. His sigh is from a picture by the painter Sensai Eitaku. The caption reads: Hohodemi no mikoto tsuribari wo yete wadatsumi no miya yori hito hiro wani ni nori kono kuni ye kayeri-tamau no dzu = The god Hohodemi returns to this land (Japan) after regaining the fishhook from the palace of the sea god, riding on the one-fathom-long crocodile1).  The sea god now questioned the god Hohodemi about the cause of his affliction and the latter] told the great deity exactly how his older brother had harassed him about the lost fishhook. The sea god then summoned all the fish of the sea, large and small, and asked them: "Has 1) The name of the sea god is also written watatsumi and watadzuini.  Cf.

 Perhaps some fish has swallowed the fishhook?" Then all the fish replied: "Recently, the tai1) complained that something was stuck in his throat, preventing him from eating, no doubt he had swallowed the fishhook." When the Tai's throat was examined, the fishhook was stuck in it.  [The sea god now released Hohodemi to his home after giving him the means to humiliate his older brother. Before doing so, he summoned the crocodiles and chose the fastest of them. The latter, a crocodile "one thread long", carried Hohodemi back to the upper world on its head in one day].  In the further course of the above narratives, too, there is a remarkable correspondence: the above-mentioned heroes now seek to embarrass and punish their brother or friend. Among the Kei Islanders, Parpara demands that his brother bring back spilt palm wine; in the Minahassa tale, Kawulusan demands that his friend reunite the banana leaf torn off by the latter as rain protection with the tree belonging to Kawulusan. In the Japanese tale, the god Hohodemi endangers his older brother with the sea flood, which he causes to come and go by means of the ebb and flood stones given to him by the sea king - in the Minahassa tale, Kawulusan oppresses his friend with heavy downpours, which he begs from the gods.  Finally, it should be noted that a Hawaiian tale shared by Bastian'-) shows some related traits. "The fishermen of the chief Konikonia returned one day, astonished that their fishing rods had broken off without any fish biting, and when the chief inquired, Kuula, the brother of Lalohana (a fishwife) who lived on land, explained to him that they had fished at the site of an undersea town where men and women lived. When Konikonia, on further inquiry, heard about his sister, he felt like marrying her3) and so on." - For the rest, however, the Hawaiian story has a different tendency, even if it again tells of a flood sent as punishment at the end. - (28) Received and purchased writings: 1.
