because he has many slaves and so she doesn't have to work so much. The fact that he already has one or more wives is of little concern to her, and in general there is also good harmony between the women - where there is no love, there is no love. Of course, this lack of love also means that the partners rarely attach importance to each other's appearance, which in turn contributes to the fact that almost all men and women are married. After this brief excursion into the dangerous corridors of love, let us return to Balundu=ba=Boa, where, on the occasion of my refusal to accept their gift, the people are said to have remarked that they did not yet know the white men, but that they now realize how immensely rich they must be, since a gift as extremely valuable in the country as a cow was not considered by the white man to be a sufficient substitute for a one-day stay in the village. The greatest disappointment, however, was felt by my people, who in this way saw the beautiful roast pass them by. In the meantime, we set off for the village of Bonsari, 5.2 kilometers away, to which a wide and good path with an average gradient of N 1700 led. Already in Voa I had heard rumors that Calabar men were in Bonjari, and now we met some people on the way who told us that they were about to leave, which is why we hastened our march. We passed several streams, the largest of which was called Limba. Called Limba, it was 10 meters wide and ½ meter deep and flowed towards 8 20° W. The ground consisted of its red sand. A little further on was the village of Bonjari, which had only about 20 houses in the street. The Calabar men, however, had disappeared. As the people said that it was not far to the landing place of the village, I decided to visit it that day. Leaving my porters at the chief's house, I set off accompanied by the interpreters and some guides. The path led to N 600 W and was sandy and hard in its first half, but later became clayey and bad. It was joined by another path coming from Bungo, which village also has a share in the landing site. This path was high, dry and covered with sand. In the middle of the playze stood a shed containing three large oil barrels belonging to the Calabar men. Several small streams flowed into the river, which is only 4-5 meters wide here. As it was low tide at the time, the banks, which were covered in a black, stinking mud, were dry, as were the exposed roots of the mangrove trees with their disgusting secretions. The place was, of course, far too unhealthy to be used as a trading post and, contrary to people's assurances, it was very far away from the village, a full 7.5 kilometers. The signposts had said that the route was short because they thought it would be best for the village if I visited the landing site. I would certainly not have done so if I had known it was that far. I found that people of that sort lied to my face with the utmost sincerity, not to say naiveté, without my being able to find a reason for it, all the less as they spoke the truth about as often. Finally, I found that they had no particular predilection for either truth or falsehood, but that their answer was always conditioned by what they considered most advantageous to themselves. If you ask them about something, they always first consider which answer would be the most advantageous for them. An example of this is their aforementioned statement about the way to the landing place and the assurance they gave me at the same time that the way to the village of Bungo was very long, the latter statement obviously being dictated by their fear that I might otherwise continue my journey there on the same day. As I found later, the distance was only about 1.5 kilometers. When we returned to Bonjari in the evening, we were served a sumptuous meal, including roast duck and dried antelope meat. The village offered me a goat, but I declined the gift as we didn't need it and the village was small and poor. The chief showed me the most beautiful girl in the village, who, he said to my astonishment, had me to thank that she was still in the village. In answer to my question he told me that half a dozen Calabar men had stolen her the day before in order to take her away with them, when the news of my arrival caused them to make off headlong, without taking time to drag along the willow, which would have been too much of a hindrance to them because of their resistance. They had already kidnapped a few women from the same village a few months ago. "It's always the prettiest women they take," the chief added with a sly wink. The following morning, my landlord showed me his oil magazine, which contained 20 to 30 large bottles of pumpkin and half a dozen anchors, all filled with his oil. There were also considerable quantities of the same goods in the other houses, which bore good witness to the industriousness of the people. This village was also bought, and after the contract was signed, we set off for Bungo, where a wide and level path led indirectly northwards. After a short march through pretty plantations, we arrived at the village, which consists of 25 houses, and set down in a spacious courtyard where everything was already arranged for our reception. Tables and chairs had been set up on the veranda and the village's most distinguished men had gathered there. The young Mafanjo did the honors as host and was dressed in large gala, i.e. in a large, thin hip dress that reached down to the floor, as well as in a new, snow-white "singlet" (or tricot shirt) and a gold-embroidered cap. In his hand he carried a large flywhisk, which served him as a baton. It was to his credit that everything was ready for consultation, so that no time was lost unnecessarily. Although he, like the others, would have liked us to stay the night, he had, at my warning, arranged everything so that the "palaver" could begin immediately. In a relatively short time we had agreed on the price and signed the contract. The old chief, Mafanjo's father, invited us for fresh coconuts, and after we had emptied them, we set off on the march to Likume. The path led to N 36° 0 through a high and dense forest. Several streams flowing to the NNW were crossed and after a five-hour march of 5 kilometers we arrived in Likume. This village was almost as big as Bonjari and almost built together with another small village of half a dozen houses. It was called Kundo. Here, too, the purchase including Kundo was completed without any particular loss of time. A number of emissaries from a nearby village, Jlloani, met us here. They asked us to come to them and buy their land. As it was still early in the afternoon, we set off immediately and now had a march of 5.2 kilometers to N. 27° E. on a slippery path almost completely overgrown with dense bushes and hodgy grass. The land here, as on the whole way from Balundu=da=Boa, was flat and clothed with the most luxuriant greenery and showed a rich and fertile soil of deep loam covered with a thick layer of black garden soil. Stones are very rare here. A few leg-covered streams with loose, slippery bottoms meandered lazily and slowly to the NW. We arrived in Illoani at 4 o'clock in the afternoon and, as usual, took up quarters with the first chief, who gave us a lodging similar to the one we had occupied in Balundu=ba=Boa. After I had washed myself, changed my clothes (on a march in Africa one always gets wet, for even when it does not rain, the clothes are so thoroughly soaked in sweat that one can wring them out, and after I had seen the cook in full ardor, where he was vigorously assisted by 2 or 3 of the chief's wives, I went for a walk through the village in the company of the interpreter. Dasselde was pretty, and the most deserted I had seen in this country. Almost all the houses were unusually tall and well-pointed, and some of them even had projecting roofs supported by thick pillars. Two houses attracted particular attention. One, belonging to the chief and made available to me on this occasion, was built in two storeys and was a faithful copy of the house that the Calabar king, Bellow Duke, had built for himself in Love. It had no door to the street, but was entered from the courtyard behind it, which was surrounded by small houses. The whole of the lower apartment was taken up by a large hall or hall into which one entered through a high and very three-sided opening without a door. In one corner of this hall there was a small chamber, or rather niche, made of bricks, which contained a place to sleep. From the portico in the courtyard, a staircase led to the upper veranda, which, like the rooms on this floor, was covered with boards hewn by the regents themselves, which were very wobbly and uneven, but nevertheless suited their purpose. From the veranda one entered a fairly large room with two windows overlooking the street. On each side of this room was a smaller room, each with a window on its side. As in all Balundu houses, all the doorposts were well jointed and neatly boarded. The windows were equipped in the same way and also fitted with shutters, which, like the doors, were fitted with charniers made in the country. The house was quite new, not even completely finished, and the only one of its kind on the Meme. A short distance from there lived the richest man in the village, whose house facing the street was distinguished from the others only by a particularly ornamental and careful fence; but after passing this, together with a small backyard with another house, one came to a large courtyard. The portico, which rose at least a couple of feet above the floor of the courtyard, was very wide and all the walls were painted with yellow figures on a dark gray background. One of the rooms in the house between the two courtyards was the owner's treasure chamber, which he showed me with great pride. The walls here were completely covered with large mirrors (most of them cracked) in gilded frames, large oil paintings in ditto, some old breech-loading rifles and carbines, percussion rifles and firelocks - more or less serviceable. - Sabres, knives, lamps, porcelain figurines, bowls and glasses, more or less blackened by smoke and dirt - large brass bowls, copper and brass buckets, and so on. After seeing and admiring all these curiosities, as well as drinking a glass of sour palm wine, which the innkeeper forced upon me, I continued my walk through the village of Sorl. It has two streets, of which the main one, which runs almost directly from east to west, has two idols or ecal houses. The main street has 80 houses and the side street 28, making a total of 108 houses, plus the smaller houses behind them, which may well be twice as many. The streets are wide and straight and all the houses are well built and carefully cleaned. This favorable impression was further enhanced by the lively folk life that developed in the evening after the moon had risen. Crowds of men and women moved up and down the main street, talking and laughing, and among the latter were an unusually large number of pretty girls, while here and there dense crowds of playing children almost completely blocked off the street. Later in the evening a great dance was arranged, in which my porters, notwithstanding their fatigue during the latter part of the day's march, took a lively part. After they had then given a performance in their hot

Page 148

When the Batoki men had given their first dance, my Bakwiri and Bomboko men organized a wrestling match, the Fala-fala, which is so popular with them and in which the Balundum men are not particularly skilled. They were therefore also defeated by my men, among whom the Batoki man Somba distinguished himself by knocking down several of the strongest men in the village. Very early the following day, a large procession of the chiefs and elders of the village came to me, all dressed in festive clothes, in large colorful pieces of clothing, shirts, skirts and hats. A goat and several large bunches of bananas were brought to me as a gift, which were immediately handed over to the cook for further preparation. The "palaver" about the sale of the village now began, but as I first wanted to know how far away the village's landing display was and what it was like, the procession was dismissed with the promise to return in the afternoon. However, the marches of the last two days had made my foot so bad that I could no longer march in my heavy leather shoes. I therefore stretched my leather belt with the pedometer hanging from it around Ngalle's waist, instructing him to go down to the landing site and, after he had inspected it, to return with me without making any detours. Very proud of this assignment and of being allowed to carry this peculiar instrument, he immediately set off, accompanied by Malombe and a guide from the village. Around noon he returned with the report that the path was flat and firm and that the landing site was good, but surrounded by creeks with mangrove trees. The pedometer showed a little over 12 kilometers, so that the distance from the landing site would be 6 kilometers, but since Ngalle did not take long steps, I assumed that it would be 5 kilometers - a calculation that I found confirmed on a later visit. In the afternoon the purchase of the village was finalized. Very early the next morning we got ready for the march to Ekumba=Liongo (Ekumbi=ba=Liongo). A hammock was made for me by folding a felt blanket in the middle and tying the four corners to two short poles, which in turn were attached to a long pole with strong ropes. I hired six men in the village to carry the hammock, two of whom took turns carrying me. As soon as the hammock was ready, we set off. Four hammock bearers marched in front, armed with fascine knives, so-called "cutlasses", with which they cleared the path of overhanging branches and creepers, then came the hammock, half of whose bearers ran, keeping up a steady, slow trot with bent knees to avoid bumps. Behind me came Ngalle with the pedometer, and I myself had the compass, so that the necessary observations could be made fairly well. After a march of 3.7 kilometers towards N 88°0 we came to a small village, Balombi=da=Mokkoli, which means Balombi at the cave, although no cave was visible. We made a short stop here to refresh ourselves with coconuts, after which we continued our journey. The path now led through several streams and had such sharp bends in many places that the hammock could only be moved forward with great difficulty. At one hill and another I had to get out and walk. Five kilometers from the village, we passed a stream, the Mokoke, which flowed with clear water and a slow current to N 10° W. At the ford point, the river had a very narrow channel. At the ford it had a width of 25 meters and a water depth of 0.9 meters where it was deepest. The bottom consisted of its red sand. The signposts said that it poured into the Meme and that during the rainy season it became a violent, raging torrent that no one could pass. Three kilometers further on, the path led to a plain that was unusually large for these parts and presented a scenery completely different from the surrounding landscape. The surface was flat as a floor, sandy and covered with three-foot-high grass that grew in scattered stools, so that one could easily pass between them. As a dignified and fitting decoration, several hundred tall, stately fan palms rose from the area. These extremely graceful trees, whose trunks expand slightly above the center and shrink again near the crown, grow here in the country only on these so rarely occurring plains, to which they give a very peculiar character When, after a journey of days, even weeks through the dark, eternal jungle, you suddenly come to such a wide, sunlit plain, which is dotted with these strange and rare trees, it seems as if you have been transported to another country. You feel as if you can breathe more easily and unconsciously stop to let your gaze really revel in this beautiful scenery. My black companions showed their surprise and admiration at the sight of this new landscape with loud exclamations, lively gestures and shining glances. They had previously heard me describe Europe as consisting of large cultivated plains, and now they asserted with great vivacity that this plain was certainly similar to my native country, and that this was the right place for the whites to build their large houses. One can imagine how well they would fare here and how much better for their health this dry, open place would be than the damp forest land! - In fact, I could not help wishing that this beautiful plain had been situated in a suitable place for us, for example on the banks of the Meme. Its size must have been at least 4 square kilometers. The fruits of the fan palm are used by the Bakwiri and Bomboko peoples as rattles for the dogs when hunting. Due to the lateral nature of the tree, the fruits are quite expensive, which is why my porters took the opportunity to collect a large quantity of them during the march across the Edene. A Negro who already carries a heavy load, and often enough complains about it, has no qualms about taking on an even heavier load if he believes he can earn extra money by doing so. When one returns from a journey into the interior of the country, it is a domestic occurrence that, in addition to their usual load, the porters also carry a lot of chickens, ducks and dogs, and even pigs and now and then an unruly goat; they have either exchanged all this cheaply or received it as a gift from their new friends On the other side of the plain were 4 slave houses belonging to Ckumba=Liongo, and a stream called Kombolat flowed northwards in the vicinity. The path, which had previously led to N 86°0, now turned to N 40°0. One kilometer further on, beyond the stream, the plantations of the village began, which, pretty and well-tended, stretched 1.5 m on both sides of the path to the beginning of the village. The last part of the path was flat and wide, and several other paths led from it in different directions into the plantations. This showed that the plantations were both extensive and well maintained. After a march of 12 km from Balombi=da=Mokkoli, we entered the village on a wide road surrounded by low bamdus houses similar to the bomdoko dwellings. The road led in a straight direction to N 20° W and climbed with a slight incline to a small hill or plateau. After passing about 40 houses, we came to an Ekalé house in the middle of the road, on the other side of which the road continued in the same direction as before, while a side road turned off to the right. This street had about 40 houses with an Ekalshaus and led down the slope, almost directly to the east. After we had passed about 20 more houses on the main street and reached an ekals' house, we found ourselves at the highest point of the village and were astonished to see that we had not gone further than halfway down the road, which led from here in the direction of N 10° W down the hill. Here was the house of Chief Musakka, which was the same as the others, and behind it two smaller, rapped houses, one of which was immediately put in order for me and the other for my people. The hammock-bearers returned at once without eating or resting. These two large rival villages have long been semi-hostile to each other, and the inhabitants of Illoani also despise the Ekumbi people as a bush tribe that is deeply inferior to them. At first glance, there seems to be a certain justification for this, as one cannot help but regard the pretty and well-built Illoani with its pretty and cheerful population as a place belonging to a higher-ranking people than the villages of the Ekumbi people with their low, fumigated bamboo houses. However, once you have gotten to know both peoples a little better, your sympathies turn decidedly towards the Ekumbi people. The Illoani people are saul and do not cultivate the land sufficiently for the needs of the village, but have to buy their food from other villages, mainly from Ekumba=Lionge, for several months every year. They also produce very little palm oil in relation to the size of their village. Ekumba=Liongo, on the other hand, is one of the most industrious communities I have seen in the country; not only the slaves and women, but also the men, and among them even the richer and more distinguished ones, work in the plantations every day from early morning until late in the afternoon. Their plantations not only provide them with food all year round, but they can also supply significant quantities of hams and planians to other Balundu villages, especially Jlloani. They also produce relatively more palm oil than Jlloani or any other Balundu village. The inhabitants of the other Ekumbi villages are also very industrious. The reason for their superiority over the Balundu people in this respect may well be that the latter, favored by their location close to the sea, have appropriated the intermediate trade between the Calabar merchants and the peoples living behind them and have more or less weaned themselves from work due to the easily obtained earnings in this way, while on the other hand the Ekumbi inhabitants, for lack of such means of communication, feel compelled to prepare all the oil they sell themselves. Of all the Ekumbi villages to the south, Ekumba=Liongo is the largest and most powerful. Along its two roads, whose combined length is close to 2 kilometers, there are 160 larger houses and many smaller ones behind them. The entire population may well be at least 2000 souls. When I arrived there were few people to be seen, as most of them were still in the plantations, but when they came home from there a little later and gathered near the chief's house, dense crowds swarmed up and down a long stretch of road. Shortly before sunset, I walked up to the highest point of the village, from where I had a magnificent view over the northern part of the village with its wide street and its two long rows of low bamboo houses, from which the smoke rose slowly in the quiet evening breeze and behind which lay the dense banana plantations, over which the extremely decorative coconut palms raised their graceful crowns by the hundreds, the whole framed in a dark frame of dense jungle - a picture of a Reger village in tropical Africa that was as true to nature as it was picturesque! A picture worthy of a painter's brush! The sense of order and diligence prevailing in this village is largely due to the chief. Of all the chiefs in this country, he is one of the few who have any real power. When his loud voice is heard through the murmur of the crowd, silence falls immediately, and when he gives orders in the same tone, a crowd of young people rush to carry them out. Although there are several

Page 149

There may be other and richer chiefs than he is, but they are nothing more than his advisors, who say yes and no to everything Musakka decides. Cleverly, he flatters their vanity by always seeking their approval, and through the approving applause of the elders of the village he gives his orders more force and emphasis, while at the same time relieving himself of a great deal of responsibility. The power he possesses is largely due to his personal qualities and merits. He is clever and perceptive, lively and intelligent, as well as a great orator who carries his listeners away almost irresistibly. All this, however, cannot explain the influence he has, for under the appearance of patriarchal rule he possesses, at least in certain cases, a truly despotic power, which he does not use, however, except on extraordinary occasions. It sometimes happens that the village disagrees with him. In such cases, he could, if he wished, impose his will, but he does not always do so, which he is often prompted to do by his own caution, which warns him not to tighten his grip too sharply. The explanation for this peculiar appearance lies in the fact that, in addition to his chieftainship, he also holds the dignity of first medicine man or head priest of the village. In this respect he enjoys great prestige and power not only in his own village but also in most of the surrounding villages of his tribe. Here is an example of his power over his people. A few months after my visit to the village just discussed, we were busy building a factory there. This rather considerable and difficult work was accomplished by the younger men of the village in three weeks. It was Musakka who assigned the work teams, instructed them in their work and encouraged them to do their best. He not only ordered and commanded, but also worked on his people's pipes himself with axe and trowel. However, it was the time when work on the plantations was at its busiest, so there was a lot of grumbling about this extra work. Often enough, Musakka also found it quite difficult to get 20 workers together, and one day they all went on strike. One of our assistants, Mr. Linell, who lived in the village to supervise the work, did not get one man to the factory in the morning. He complained about this to Musakka, who was very angry and promised that they should all go to work that day as punishment. The white man could go to the workplace, the people would follow immediately. Curious to see how this would turn out, Mr. Linell went out into the street, where he soon saw Musakka, his head covered with a top hat, step out and make his way to the Ekalé house, on the way shouting orders to go to work and threats of all kinds, mingled with mystical incantations. (To be continued.) The Northwest German Trade and Industry Exhibition in Bremen. Last year, Hamburg began to boldly face the consequences for trade and traffic resulting from the annexation of the Hanseatic cities on October 15, 1888, and to define this enormous economic turning point in the development of the city, and now Bremen has also organized its exhibition. These exhibitions have become an economic necessity insofar as the Hanseatic cities have had to integrate themselves closely into German national economic life as a result of the customs union, if they were not to sink to a secondary role in export capability. It goes without saying that the economic life of the Hanseatic cities now had to seek more and more support in trade with the surrounding regions. The more powerful the trades and industries flourish in the Hanseatic cities, the easier it will be to sell to neighboring countries and, above all, to foreign countries. Although these large cities on our North Sea coast will certainly remain the focal points of the commission business for the domestic export industry for a long time to come, it depends on the energy and activity of their industrial circles to what extent they themselves will satisfy the export demand. While Hamburg, due to its particularly fortunate development, seems to be in a position to gradually satisfy this export need on its own, the smaller Bremen has to struggle with greater difficulties, so that it must be concerned about expanding its sales area inland. A lively exchange trade with the neighboring countries, especially Oldenburg and the province of Hanover, will certainly lead to an increase in its production. Once the customs connection had been decided upon, Bremen did not for a moment fail to recognize the direction in which its tasks were now to be sought; it initiated the deepening of the Lower Weser as far as Bremen City, created new port facilities, established new lines and constantly made the greatest effort to improve its water and land connections with the hinterland. However, at an exhibition that was primarily intended to serve exports, it was natural that world trade, insofar as it was import trade, could not remain unrepresented. It was also an extremely rewarding task to present the splendid development of shipping, its recent triumphs and Bremen's share in deep-sea fishing to a wider public in a comprehensive exhibition. We are particularly interested in the trade exhibition, which differs in many respects from last year's exhibition in Hamburg. The building itself is in the style of the North German Renaissance, which the rich Hansa merchants of his time favored in the foreign cities where they had branches, crowned by allegorical figures and the famous Mercury of Giovanni di Bologna. If the exterior presents itself in a very dignified and solid manner, the interior, which is excellently arranged and rich in picturesque features, does not fail to make an impression on the innocent observer, nor does it leave those who want to find out more about certain aspects of Bremen's trade in the lurch. The visitor first enters an imposing central hall, in which a mighty atlas bearing the globe rises up and behind which the tobacco exhibition, which unfortunately was not yet open when we visited, is supposed to follow as a main factor of Bremen's trade. This was all the more regrettable as it is important to gain a clear picture of the extent of Bremen's tobacco trade after the customs union and as it could be of interest for our tobacco production in the colonies in the course of time to learn something more precise about the current tobacco trade from the eastern hemisphere. For the time being, as we would like to point out at the outset, tobacco exports from our colonies play a rather modest role at the Bremen exhibition, as only the New Guinca Company has exhibited a few samples, which promise to be of good quality once the handling has become more appropriate. In a few weeks, however, this part of the trade exhibition will also be opened, and we recommend a visit to it to all those who have yet to see for themselves the tremendous way in which the production of a great imported article from the colonies has contributed to the enormous upswing in industry and trade. The rest of the trade exhibition is quite complete. If we move from the central hall to the right, immediately after an overview of the Mediterranean countries, we come across the exhibition of North American petroleum, which, like many other separate exhibitions, is made more attractive by beautifully executed murals. The figures for the import of petroleum speak for themselves as to the importance of this import article: In 1870 the import amounted to 424,593 quintals, in 1889 to 1,769,704 quintals, worth 20 million marks. Further on the same wall are the exhibitions of the Spanish West Indies and Mexico, the latter of which is enlivened by some very lovely genre paintings that express the Mexican life of the lower classes in a vivid way. It is an advantage of this exhibition that the most important occupations not only of the natives of Mexico, but also of Argentina and above all of India, are brought vividly to view by the exhibitors showing groups of "small figures in their various activities. For example, on a large model one can closely follow the method of processing indigo, as is customary in India, observe the workers in their various activities and also visualize the entire jute manufacturing process down to its smallest details. The most beautiful thing that has been achieved in this respect is the model of an Indian city quarter with its bustling commercial and human life, animated by hundreds of figures, which would be a first-class attraction in any museum. If we continue on our way after this digression, we come to the exhibition of cotton, for which, as is well known, Bremen became the first market on the European mainland. In 1889, Liverpool imported 2,780000 bales, Bremen 720,812 bales. Although Liverpool will remain the main place for cotton imports for some time to come due to its particularly favorable conditions, the increase in Bremen's trade, which rose from 157,689 bales in 1870 to the aforementioned level (worth 130 million marks), proves the extent to which Bremen has succeeded in gaining such an important position. In a similar way, Bremen's trade, which is limited to only a few articles, has increasingly taken over the import of wool, which we now come to on our tour. The Bremen wool statistics show the following figures:

Page 150

Import. Delivery for consumption, sale in (bales) and transit. Bremen. 1870 24519 15539 3488 73 18 5270 2237 1890 152 803 117405 43 683 In tasteful posters we can follow the wool from the fleece to the finished spun yarn and also visualize the three main countries of origin for wool: La Plata States, Australia and Cape Town in three pictures. Passing by the exhibitions of the British West Indies, Colombia and Central America, our attention is drawn to Brazil, which is represented by a small but select exhibition, and the very rich collection of the La Plata States in a joint presentation. We will not dwell on the details here, as we intend to give our readers a more rounded picture of these individual exhibitions later on, but enter the other side wing, which is largely dedicated to the Oriental world. As Bremen has a huge trade with the Indies, this exhibition is the most complete we have seen in this respect so far. The Sunda Islands and the East Indies occupy an entire wall of the same wing, leading over to the German colonial exhibition, which is in many respects inferior to the Hamburg exhibition. It is well known that Bremen's relations with our colonies are still rather limited today, since, with the exception of the Togo region, not a single important Bremen company has, to our knowledge, shown any significant interest in the colonial development of Africa. The New Guinea Company has exhibited a large number of its products, among which we would particularly like to mention wood, tobacco and plant fibers, while Africa is unfortunately only very poorly represented. And yet this colonial corner in particular is of great interest, as Dr. Finsch has exhibited his excellent ethnological collection and the paintings by Mr. Hellgrewe and Mr. Hoffmann from Berlin have depicted the scenic landscapes in a characteristic manner and with excellent execution. We pass over the precious exhibition of the Hawatic and Japanese governments, the oriental exhibition, sweetly scented with rose oil and other drugs, in order to point out another peculiarity of Bremen's trade, the import of rice, as a result of which Bremen rose to become the first rice market in the world. In 1889 the import of rice amounted to 227,032 tons, while Liverpool received an import of 162,383 and Hamburg only 76,446 tons. The quantity of rice hulled and polished in Bremen for export amounted to a value of 30 million marks in 1889. One third of this went to the German interior; the remainder was distributed to other non-European countries which, due to their weak industrial development, have not yet been able to compete with Bremen's rice hulling mills. Today, our colonies still play a modest role in the large trading operations of the Hanseatic cities, but we hope that the time will soon come when German colonial products will gain somewhat more importance among the main imported goods of our Hanseatic cities than they do today. The way to achieve this goal is very difficult and it is easy to understand that many large merchants will prefer to continue along the familiar lines rather than embark on new and possibly costly ventures. But the attempt will have to be made sooner or later, when the difficulties of colonial exploitation in foreign countries have increased and the conditions for imports from our colonies, as far as the connection and customs conditions are concerned, have changed in such a way that the spirit of enterprise can find its account more easily than is sometimes possible today. Communications from the Society. The Committee held a meeting on May 20 under the chairmanship of Dr. Hammacher, a member of the Reichstag, at which several issues relating to the Annual General Meeting in Cologne were discussed. Several motions were submitted by departments, which were either dealt with or referred to the Rules Committee for preliminary deliberation. A report by the government architect K. Hoffmann dd. Sansibar, April 23, 1890, was read out, from which it emerges that Mr. Hoffmann will not carry out his plan to establish a branch in Hohenzollernhafen for the time being, according to the inquiries he has made, but will return here soon. A letter from the Imperial Navy Office informs the committee that the costs for the memorials to be erected in East Africa and on the Samoa Islands for the fallen of the navy have already been covered by the contributions of the naval officer corps, so that the amount of 500 marks provided by our society or the Graudenz department can no longer be used. At the suggestion of the Reichsmarineamt and in agreement with the Graudenz department, it is decided to transfer the sum in question to the fund for the surviving dependants of the crews who died on Samoa. The submitted bylaws of the Dirschau division are approved. The committee accepts the notification of the formation of a department in Annaberg and Fleusburg and expresses its thanks to the gentlemen who have rendered outstanding services in bringing it about. The board of the Annaberg section consists of the following gentlemen: Fr. Weinmers, chairman, Hermann Adler, secretary, H. Th. Richter, treasurer. Fleusburg Section. A section of the German Colonial Society was founded here in a meeting held on May 17 in the Colosseum. Shipowner H. Schuldt was elected chairman, commercial school teacher Dr. Engelcke secretary, and bookseller Oskar Hollesen treasurer. - The Flensburg branch already has about 30 members, but it is to be expected that the lively interest shown in the patriotic enterprise at the meeting will soon lead to a further substantial increase in membership. Gotha Branch. The department held its statutory general meeting on February 25 under the chairmanship of Professor Dr. Supan, who opened the meeting with a presentation on the current status of our protected areas. Mr. Gerichtsassessor Boettner presented the annual report and Mr. Kommerzienrat Strupy the cash report. From the annual report, which was prepared with great care, we learn that three major lecture evenings were held during the course of the past year and that the department made great efforts to spread the colonial idea. Small announcements. - (German East Africa.) Nothing new has arrived from Emin Pasha. - According to unattributed English reports, Dr. Peters is said to have helped to strengthen Mwanga's position against Karema in Uganda and to have received valuable assurances. - At the end of May, the Imperial Commissioner, Major Wißmann, traveled to Germany with Soliman den Rasr, a respected Arab who, as a confidant of the Sultan of Zanzibar, had always taken a pro-German position and was most recently Vali of Pangani. The Ghef in the Schutztruppe, Dr. Schmidt, has been entrusted with deputizing for the Reichskommissar during his absence of several months. - The chiefs, Premierleutnant Freiherr v. Gravenreuth and v. Eberstein, have arrived here on leave. - The presence of the Reichskommissar here is likely to be important for the further development of our Africa policy insofar as, on the basis of the detailed report to be submitted by him on the current situation, the resolutions will be drawn up which will ensure the appropriate safeguarding and appropriate utilization of the colonial-potitical achievements purchased with so many sacrifices. - The Protestant mission has recruited Pastor Worms from the Bruderhaus Nazareth near Bielefeld as pastor for the hospital in Zanzibar, to which the Emperor has donated 20,000 marks. - The chief Mandara of Moschi, with whom Otto Ehlers (who has now traveled to India in order to visit New Guinea later) recently performed the flag-raising ceremony upon presentation of the gifts from His Majesty the Emperor, seems to have taken renewed occasion from this to devastate the land of the surrounding chiefs in order to make himself the sole ruler of Djaggaland. Some states on Kilimanjaro voluntarily came under Mandara's suzerainty, and his chiefs hoisted the German flag. Chief Marcale of Marungu, who has become better known through Dr. Meyer's travels, was also expelled by Mandara and his country totally devastated. - Mr. Ehlers has written a lengthy letter to Professor Schweinfurth in which he admits that he was mistaken in his well-known ascent of Kilima = Adjaro in 1888 in that he assumed at the time that he had reached the second highest peak of the mountain, whereas he has now discovered that there is still a lower peak which had eluded his view at the time. - The opening of the new East African steamer line will coincide with the opening of the German post office in Sausidar. Furthermore, the construction of a German telegraph line is planned, which will connect the individual coastal towns with each other and with Zanzibar. - The 7.9 cm gun captured by the "Leipzig" at Bagamoyo has been transferred to the Directorate of Naval Education for incorporation into the trophy collection. The other captured 4.rem gun is retained by the Reichskommissar, into whose possession it was transferred by purchase from the German East African Company. - As reported in the "Times" from Zanzibar, Stokes will leave Saadani with a large caravan and go to Lake Nyanza with Bishop Tucker. (Cameroon). The Bakwiri people living on government land in Victoria have to pay a levy of 2 marks at the end of each year for the use of the land. - The botanist Preuß arrived in Komerun on April 12 and will take over the management of the Barombi station. - Very favorable reports on the two German schools in the Cameroon region have been received from the teachers Christaller and Flad, published by the Colonial Gazette. - At Victoria, work on road construction and other transportation improvements is brisk. (South West Africa). According to the latest news, Leutnani v. François has left Tsaobis (about 30 km from Otjimbingne), which he had fortified, with 40 men of his troop and on May 6 went first to Otjimbingne, the actual seat of the Imperial Commissioner. There, a friendly exchange took place between Lieutenant v. François and the leading Hereros. From there he moved to Okahandya to the north-east to pay a visit to the Maharero living there.

and show him the reinforced Schutztruppe. From there he wanted to go south to Redoboth to the Bastards. A crew of 10 men remained behind in Tsaobis. (The annual report of the Association for Protestant Missions in Cameroon) for 1890, which has just been published, once again urges all friends of the Cameroon mission to support the efforts of the Basel missionaries and reminds the colonial friends that they owe a debt of honor to the Basel missionaries, who stepped in most willingly when the English missionaries were inclined to give up their work there after the acquisition of Cameroon by Germany. The association domiciled in Stuttgart was then formed to support the Protestant Missionary Society of Basel in its missionary work in Cameroon; last year it was able to pay 10,976.1 marks to the Basel missionaries, a rather modest contribution in relation to the total expenditure of around 72,000 marks. This sum has been raised by the association almost exclusively in Württemberg, but a work such as the German Cameroon Mission, which has only been taken over as a result of the development of German colonial relations, deserves full and joyful support throughout Germany, especially from our seaside towns, where the most direct relations to there take place. The reports from the missionaries in Cameroon are encouraging and hopeful; the mission in Mangamba in Abolande (see map in No. 10 of the "Deutsche Kolonialzeitung") seems to be developing particularly well. Mangamba itself is a town of about 10,000 inhabitants who speak a language somewhat different from the Dualla dialect. The list of outstations shown on the map shows how energetically the people of Basel are pursuing missionary work. We would therefore like to ask our departments in particular to lend their energetic support to this association and are happy to arrange the sending of statutes and annual reports. Membership of the association is obtained by paying an annual fee of 2 marks. Contributions and membership declarations are accepted by the treasurer of the association, Finanzrat 2. D. Klaiber in Stuttgart, Olgastrasse 69 C, and the following members of the committee: Landgerichtsrat Nestle, board of directors; Stadtpfarrer Kolb, secretary; Kaufmann F. Edevalier; Eduard Elben; Missionsprediger Frigz; Gemeinderat G. Gundert; Professor Dr. Huder; Bergrat Dr. Klüpfel; Missionar Mann; Oberkonsistorialrat Römer; Kaufmann Nath. Rominger; merchant J. G. Vöbringer; director P. Zilling, all in Stuttgart. - (Togo region.) On April 1, the former Imperial Commissioner von Puttkamer issued a decree prohibiting the export of war material from the Togo region to Dahomey for the duration of the Blolade. The experimental plantation near Sebbe has had the favorable result that the company J. K. Vietor is considering setting up a larger enterprise for the purpose of tobacco cultivation in Togo. Cotton has developed well; trials will soon be made with Kalao. Protectorate of the New Guinea Company). The Colonial Gazette publishes a decree on the transfer of consular powers to the Commissioner for the protectorate, as well as a decree on the reduction of the official powers of the colonial chiefs. - News from the New Guinea Company revealed that colonial companies are in the process of being formed which intend to establish plantations in the New Guinea protectorate. In connection with this, it has now been announced from Hamburg that an "Kaiser Wilbelmsland Plantation Company" has been formed there with a capital of 900,000 marks, which intends to cultivate coffee and cocoa on a large scale in our South Sea protectorate. Sir Perey Anderson) has returned to Berlin and the negotiations on the delimitation of the sphere of interest will be resumed. The English colonial chauvinists are furious that the English "right of way" from south to north is not recognized and the representatives of the government are taking a reasonable stand. Under-Secretary of State Fergusson said on the 26th of this month: "Although the English first opened Africa to civilization, England must be content with a part of Africa. If England wanted to dictate to the whole world, she would have to have a much larger army and navy; the government would have to give full encouragement to English ventures, but it must not assume enormous responsibilities." We hope that the German government will remain cool towards the British chauvinists' bramar bashing. It is not quite clear how the correspondent of the Standard, who supposedly draws from informed circles, comes to the conclusion that Germany will make certain concessions after all. The wish was probably the father of the thought. - On April 24, Prof. Sueß gave a lecture on the construction of East Africa at the Vienna Academy of Sciences, which followed on from Count Teleki's and von Höhnel's recordings. Sueß argues that "according to the consistent statements of travelers, eastern Africa is crisscrossed by numerous trench-shaped depressions and that Höhnel's depiction of the area around Lake Rudoli and Lake Steiani establishes a connection with the Eryidraean Trench and the Trench of the Dead Sea in a peculiar and unexpected way. "The Nyassa lies in a meridional rift valley, which is deflected north of the lake towards the NW and perhaps includes Lake Leopold. Tanganvika lies in an independent rift valley, which, as its divergent fanna shows, is probably of greater age. More distant from it, however, as can be seen from Stauley's description, are Lake Aldertiee and Lake Albert Edward. While the meridional trench of the Nrassa is deflected to the north, a new meridional trench appears further north, the southern end of which is unknown, but which, from Lake Manjara to Lake Rudolfu10 to Lake Stefanie, surrounds a number of drainless lakes, including Naiwascha and Baringo, and which lies along its entire length between the river basin of the Nile and the slope to the Indian Ocean. Teleki's and Hohnel's journey has revealed to us the course of the same up to the vicinity of the Abyssinian highlands. A gap remains in the area of Lake Abala, and it is not possible to say with certainty whether there is an outflow from this lake to the east or not. However, it is clear from Höhnel's descriptions on the one hand, and from Borelli's on the other. Ragarzi and Traversi that the phenomenon of the collapse does not end at the Stefanieiee. The eastern break-off of the Abyssinian highlands is to be regarded as the true western boundary of the Erethrian Trench. The southern coast of the Gulf of Aden, which is parallel to the northern coast, continues inland over the area of Harar, and the entire drainless area of Hawash and Afar as far as Massanah is to be regarded as sunken land, part of the Erythraean Rift Valley. A further meridional graben depression encompasses the Gulf of Kkaba, the Dead Sea and the course of the Jordan; only near the outer edge of the folded Eurasian arcs does the break split into the Virgation of Palmpra described by Diener ("Petermanns Mitteilungen"). - (On the treatment of dysentery, dossenteria.) In addition to the report in the previous issue of the Kolonialzeitung, we should also note that instead of rinsing the intestines with Salicol=Borax=solution, a 2-5% solution of tannic acid can also be used, as has recently been indicated by Cantani for the treatment of cholera. The tannic acid can also be carried as a powder of sufficient quality in a glass jar. Litterature. Vice Nanterarsa. Ia Nassaua a Saati. Narrazione della speditiono Italiana del 1888 in Abissinia. Con un'appondice contonente il testo comploto del Libro Vorde presentato al Parlamento. la rolarione ufficialsul combattimento di Saganeiti et tutio lo noto Crispi o Goblet sull incidento di Massaua. With 14 incisioni. Milan. Fratolli Treves, editor. Iecembre 1888. On 26th January 1837, as is well known, the Italian column of about 300 men, which had been sent from Monkullo under Lieutenant-Colonel Cristoforis to relieve Saati, who was besieged by Ras Alula Bart, was surrounded and destroyed by the same general at Dogali. In order to avenge this defeat, larger Italian forces were sent to Massana in the course of 1887. One of these expeditions, which embarked in Naples in November, was joined by the newspaper reporter Mantegazza; the account of his experiences and impressions first appeared in chronologically ordered letters in the "Corrioro della Sera" and in the "Illustrazione Italiana Mantegazza has now edited, expanded and improved these letters and published them in book form. Although Mantegazza's stay in Abyssinia came to an end with the return to Italy of Lieutenant General San Marzano and part of the expeditionary corps, the author has succeeded in giving us an extremely vivid picture of the expedition from the embarkation in Naples to the arrival in Massaua and the reoccupation of Saati, of the whole military activity, the peculiarities of the country and the population, the influence of the foreigners, the Italians, the English and the French, the relationship between the expedition and the English and the French. English and French, the relationship of the Italians to the Negus, the political and administrative institutions in Massaua, supported by text illustrations. Reisebilder aus Liberia, Ergebnisse geographischer, naturwissenschaftlicher und ethnographischer Untersuchungen während der Jahre 1879 bis 1882 un 1886bis 1887 von J. Büttikofer, Konservator am zoologischen Reichs museum in Leiden. With maps, collotype and chromolithographic plates together with numerous tertillustrations. 1 volume. Travel and character pictures. Leiden, E. J. Brill 1390 The journeys undertaken by the author pursued a scientific purpose, namely the exploration of the hitherto little-known Fanna of Liberia and, as a result, the enrichment of the Imperial Museum in Leiden. He succeeded in doing both very well. It is natural that such a keen observer as Mr. Büttikofer, for whom even the slightest thing in a foreign country seems worthy of attention and recording, should not limit his observations to fauna alone, but also extend them to mineralogy, flora and geography. The work is written in an extremely stimulating manner and one does not know what to admire more: the keen powers of observation of apparently minor things or the rare perseverance with which the author, actually constantly suffering from fever or colic and malignant ulcers on his legs and often suffering from hunger, braved the climate and the inclemency of the weather. the unfavorable weather, the dangers and obstacles of the jungle and, above all, the cunning, slyness, malice, laziness and idiocy of the thieving and treacherous blacks. Apart from Monrovia and Robertsport, the individual factories and missions (American) and their surroundings, there is no sign of culture in Liberia; indeed, slavery is still in full bloom in some places, although no more slaves may be exported; the Republic has proved completely powerless against neighboring regent kings invading Liberian territory on several occasions (once during Büttikofer's presence). The nation, if one can speak of one, makes a degenerate impression. Guide to learning the Malahi colloquial language (Coastal Malahi by Dr. Richard Hindorf. 2 Mk. Berlin 1820, published by Carl Hermanns Verlag. The hope of many colonial friends that the establishment of the ortental seminary would lead to the publication of textbooks on the more important colonial languages.

Page 152

Unfortunately, the expectation that this would be followed by a new language has not yet been fulfilled. We still use English textbooks and vocabularies today. We must therefore be all the more pleased when, thanks to the initiative of a private individual, we are offered a practical, thoroughly appropriate handbook such as Hindorf's guide to Malay. The textbooks and dictionaries of Malay published to date by Fayre. Swettenham, Dennys and Kijnenberg, quite apart from the fact that they were published in Dutch, English or French, had the disadvantage for those who are only interested in learning to speak Malay soon that they correspond more to scientific than to practical requirements. In some of these works, the mere fact that the Malavian words are also printed in Arabic has a deterrent effect on the beginner. Only Hüttenbach's small guide (Worms, Stern 1888. 2 Mk.) took some account of the needs of the German speaker moving to the Far East; but Hesichen's, which was content to bring a few volables without alphabetical or other order and without any rule or explanation, was quite imperfect. Hindorf's guide, on the other hand, contains everything necessary for speaking the lingua franco used in the Jndish archipelago, the more important grammatical rules, vocabularies organized and classified in a highly practical manner and, at the end, the most common idioms and conversations. The format of the book is convenient and the layout is good. We wish the guide the widest distribution and the author many imitators who bring the languages of our colonies closer to us and facilitate their study. Entrances for the library. Due to the limited resources available to us for book reviews, it is not possible to review all works in detail, but we never fail to recommend new colonial writings, which are assigned to our library by the authors and publishers, to colonial friends in word and deed, for which the administration of the library is grateful for many contributions from our members. Once again, we would like to express our sincere thanks for the books donated to our library. Receipts in April. Aobic "y d. Recueil de Jarioprudence Coleniale 3 vel. gr. 4° Imp.

These tickets will be handed out to members at the Annual General Meeting on June 30. Upon written request, the secretary of the Cologne section, Mr. Referendar Clemens, Cologne, Hohenzollernring 37, will send them in advance. The German-English negotiations have led to a surprising result. On June 17, the German Reichdanzeiger reported in a special edition: "As a result of the recent negotiations, agreement has been reached between the German and British governments on the following points, which form an inseparable whole:
The German sphere of interest in East Africa is limited a) in the south: by a line running from the mouth of the Rokura in the west of Lake Nyassa to the mouth of the Kilambo in the south of Lake Tanganyka, b) in the north: by a line running along the 1st degree south latitude from the west bank of the Victoria=Nyanza to the Congo State and bypassing Mount Mfumbiro to the south. Between Lake Nyassa and the Congo State, between Nyassasce and Lake Tanganyka, on Lake Tanganyka and between the latter and the northern boundary of the mutual spheres of interest, the traffic of the subjects and goods of both nations shall remain free of all dues. In the mutual spheres of interest the missions of both states shall be granted freedom of worship and education. The subjects of one state shall enjoy the same rights in the sphere of interest of the other with regard to the establishment of trade as the subjects of the state to which the sphere of interest belongs. England will use all her influence to persuade the Sultan of Zanzibar to cede to Germany the stretch of coast leased by him to the German East African Company. In this case, Germany will grant the Sultan reasonable compensation for the customs revenue he is losing. 2 The boundary between the German and English spheres of interest in South-West Africa shall run eastward from the point agreed upon in the former agreement along the 22nd degree of south latitude to the 21st degree of longitude, thence northward along this degree to the intersection of the same with the 18th degree of south latitude, and thence eastward along the Chobi River to its confluence with the Zambezi.3. the boundary between the German Togo territory and the English Gold Coast colony shall, according to the German proposal, be formed by a line cutting through the disputed landscape of Krespi in such a way that the northern part with Kpandu falls to Germany, the southern part with Peki to England. (4) Germany transfers to England her patronage over Witu and Somaliland in the north of the English sphere of interest. (5) Germany consents to England assuming the protectorate over the Sultanate of Zanzibar, with the exception of the coastal strip leased to the German East African Company. 6. subject to the authorization of Parliament, England cedes the island of Heligoland to His Majesty the German Emperor. A period of time shall be agreed for the introduction of compulsory military service and German customs legislation in Heligoland, and the present inhabitants shall be granted the right to opt for English nationality for a certain period of time. 7. the other points of difference relating to colonial questions: Complaint about the embarkation of the steamer "Neera", demarcation of Walvis Bay, complaint against the English Riger Company, etc., having established that there are no serious differences of opinion on these matters in the Principality, are reserved for further amicable agreement. 8. until the formal conclusion of the present agreement, which is to be effected in the shortest possible time by an exchange of notes, no enterprise in Africa which is in conflict with the foregoing agreements will be sanctioned by either government. This agreement is more reasonable for Germany than could have been expected from the previous announcements in the English papers. For the time being, we reserve the right to give a more detailed assessment of this agreement, the consequences of which cannot yet be foreseen, as we only received the notification from the Reichsanzeiger after the editorial deadline The acquisition of Heligoland will give great satisfaction to German national sentiment, quite apart from the advantages it offers for the protection of the Elbe and Weser estuaries. Colonial policy in the Reichstag. The second deliberation on the supplementary budget, which for the suppression of the slave trade and the protection of German interests in East Africa amounts to 4½ million marks, was continued on June 9 and ended on June 12, as we would like to note at the outset, with the budget being adopted by a large majority of the Reichstag. In addition to the Conservative parliamentary group and the National Liberals, the vast majority of the Center Party deputies also voted in favor of the requested sums. In the minority were the Free German Party, the People's Party, the Social Democrats and some members of the Center Party. Although these negotiations were by and large very similar to the earlier ones and produced few new moments, but were always conducted with the same - by the opponents quite unskillfully - methods.

While the opponents of colonialism usually focus their attacks on the alleged weakness of our front in East Africa, namely that the development of the country is not in proportion to the amount of money and people invested, this time they directed their attacks primarily against the government's lack of program. Although the Reich Chancellor had already declared in his speech on May 12 that the government would proceed step by step, as Germany's honor and interests demanded, i.e. that it would pursue a colonial policy without any major leaps, this declaration was not enough for the colonial opponents, who were already demanding a program in theoretical doggedness at the present time. Anyone who has studied East African affairs only a little knows that a careful examination of the present situation reveals the approximate directions which, taken together, can be decisive for the later formulation of a program, but that it is in fact impossible to do this satisfactorily today. But this call for a specific program is part of the tactics of the colonial opponents. When Prince Bismarck hinted at the framework in which he wanted to pursue colonial policy, the colonial opponents gave the impression of agreeing, but even before the program had been expanded, the anti-German battle cry was already sounding: "All the colonies that Germany has acquired are fever colonies! Afterwards it was easy for them to constantly explain their negative attitude with the government's overstepping of the earlier program, even though the implementation of the same, if a real colonial policy was to be pursued at all, soon turned out to be impossible. While they stood still, the wheel of history, which has often played havoc with the most beautiful programs, passed over them. After all, it is absurd to draw up a careful program, as the opponents wish, for the treatment of conditions that are as nascent as those in East Africa and whose scope is still as little to be overlooked as that of the displacement of peoples in Central Africa. The opponents wish to use the new "program" only as a tactical tool, and since, unfortunately, colonial policy is viewed and treated according to factional interests, they will only use it to cause the government embarrassment later, when, as the course of events dictates, it has to be modified. State Secretary v. Marschall described this endeavor to Representative Hausmann as follows: At the beginning of his speech, the previous speaker called the position of the allied governments on colonial policy a nebulous and vague one and based this assertion on the fact that we have not yet presented a definite program on the future conduct of our colonial policy. The accusation, when made publicly, is so serious that I must reply in a few words. It is a peculiar coincidence that the allied governments are accused of pursuing a vain, vague colonial policy at a time when a very lively agitation is under way elsewhere, which never tires of telling our friendly nation on a daily basis that only the German colonial policy is actually a purposeful and clear one, and that anyone who does not emulate this colonial policy will certainly fall behind. This comparison will suffice to show that Germany's colonial policy is not as bad as the previous speaker thought. Anyone who looks back at what happened on the East African coast three quarters of a century ago and looks at what is happening there today and draws unbiased conclusions will simply not understand the previous speaker's accusation Gentlemen, the goals we set ourselves in the February agreement were very specific. The way in which these goals have been partly achieved and partly initiated over the past three quarters of a century has not only been widely recognized in this country, but has also aroused the admiration of the whole of the world, and I believe we have every reason to be proud of this. (Laughter from the Social Democrats. - I regret that you laugh at this; I simply state a factIf the allied governments, now that we have come so far, demand a short period of time to become clear in all directions about the way in which the successes achieved so far are to be realized, and if in doing so they desire to leave no source of inspiration unnoticed and, wherever possible, to overlook all eventualities, they deserve no reproach for this. On the contrary, you will gather from this that the allied governments are still determined to adopt only that course which, after careful consideration and overlooking all eventualities, they are certain will lead to the desired end. I can give the assurance from the outset that not only the general interests, but also the financial interests in particular, will be safeguarded in all directions. I would therefore ask the gentlemen to wait a little longer. We will probably be in a position to present you with a program in the next session, and I hope that the accusation we have just heard from the previous speaker will then no longer be made. They already have a program for East Africa, they do not want to pull everything out of there immediately, but they want, as Dr. Bamberger said the other day, to initiate a liquidation, so that in one day we transfer everything we have there, the guns, cannons, all the firing troops, to the East African Society and say: now see how you get on with it. Gentlemen, that is a program, and I admit it is a very simple one; but I am firmly convinced that, if we carry out this program, we shall then take a path which will certainly lead to the result which these gentlemen do not want either, namely, that on a fine day we shall be faced with the alternative of either starting the whole work all over again or renouncing all that we have achieved at great sacrifice of good and blood. That would be a program that the allied governments would not be able to support, not even for financial reasons. Dr. Hammacher spoke at length about the difficulties of the subsequent development of constitutional law in an important speech, in which he first rejected the assertion that there was no lively interest in colonial affairs among the German people at all and attributed the other view, that the inhabitants of the seaside towns were cool towards colonial policy, to its true value. In response to the accusation that the government had no program, he explained the following: Beute, too, was repeatedly accused of "lacking the correct picture, the government's plan", "we do not know where it wants to go" "it was unclear what further costs would be incurred in the future in order to achieve the purposes envisaged here", "who should bear the costs", "the empire alone, for example?" "Shouldn't the costs be passed on to the shoulders of the East African Society?" and so on. Gentlemen, perhaps many of you are not aware that the German-East African area of interest or protection is by no means the same as the area of interest of the German-East African Association. The latter only owns 5 individual parts, Usagara, Usequa, Nguru and Ukami, with a total size of about 2000 to 2500 square miles. The German area of interest, which fell to us through the treaty between Germany and England, is ten times larger. It extends in the north from the mouth of the Tana to Lake Victoria=Ryanza, to latitude 1° F via Kavirondo, and in the south from the Rovuma River via Lake Nyassa. Now consider the following. What we have granted and are still to grant in terms of imperial funds is expressly intended to serve the protection of German interests and at the same time to combat the slave trade. The latter purpose is even, I believe, in the spirit and spirit of the majority of the Reichstag, which approved the funds, placed in the foreground. Can you now, for all the world, expect the East African Society, which owns only a part of this area to be brought into civilization, into Christianity, to bear all the costs arising from the expeditions in the future? I think - and in this I fully agree with Mr. Windthorft, whom I consider myself obliged to thank for the thoroughly loyal consistency which he again expressed today - I think, gentlemen, that it is first of all the task of the Foreign Office to make those considerations in an equitable manner with regard to this, on the answer to which the financial agreement with the East African Society depends. In other words, the answer to the question of whether and to what extent the Reich should in future also provide Reich funds for the purposes for which we are now being asked to provide credit in the budget. I don't know what these gentlemen are thinking. In the absence of thoughts, a word will come in due course. Do you believe that the present or any other German Emperor would ever place himself under the sovereignty of the Sultan of Sanstbar and take the 10-mile-wide coastal strip under his sovereign administration, which, as you know, has remained under the sovereignty of the Sultan of Sanstbar? No, gentlemen, in Europe we have a similar legal situation between Turkey and Austria with regard to Herzegovina and Bosnia. But the differences between this and that case are so vast that none of us doubts the impossibility, as long as the Sultan of Zanzibar still has territorial sovereignty on the coast, of establishing a German crown colony in the full sense and having the German Emperor take the place of the present Company vis-à-vis the Sultan of Sanstbar. - Allow me to make a remark with reference to the examples of other countries. It is often assumed here in the Reichstag, as I believe to my amazement, as if the English had exclusively or predominantly charter colonies, as if the colonial interests of the English government were to be pursued in the form of charter colonies as a rule. Nothing could be further from the truth, gentlemen; most of England's colonies are not charter colonies, but actually crown colonies - I use this expression merely for the sake of brevity, and in particular those colonies which England has acquired since Germany entered the colonial policy and in connection with German protectorates, belong, with the exception of the East African territories, to the nature of crown colonies. While Germany established an actual charter colony on the island of New Quinea along the lines of Bismarck's

Page 156

 The eastern part of the island of New Guinea, which fell to England under the treaty, has become an English crown colony. The Australian state of Queensland provides an annual grant of 10,000 pounds sterling. Private individuals contribute nothing to the solution of the governmental tasks in English New Guinea. The situation is similar in Betschuanaland, the English colonial possession in Central Africa, which adjoins the eastern side of our FWA and was transferred to England at the same time as we acquired South West Africa. It has not occurred to anyone in England to demand that this colonial possession be taken over by a charter colony, or that the costs involved be borne by private individuals. It is the English Government, and with very rich hands, as we have been repeatedly told from the Government table, that provides the funds for the entire administration. The remark of Dr. Dohrn, my colleague, that the New Guinea Company, out of the need for police supervision, has recently decided to have the governmental administration of the country carried out by imperial officials at its own expense, gives me special cause for a further discussion of the question of the Crown Colonies. I must disagree with Dr. Dohrn's assumption. It was not a lack of self-confidence on the part of the New Guinea Company that prompted it to desire that the Imperial Government take over the governmental administration of the country, but rather the experience gained over the years that it leads to irresolvable contradictions when a chartered company exercises the rights of the authorities. In other words, the right to exercise jurisdiction, to levy taxes and customs duties in a country where, in addition to their private business, similar private interests are also pursued by other persons. The same government, the same people had to represent the interests of the state, which lay in certain state railroads, and at the same time supervise similar enterprises whose interests often collided with the interests of state property and state enterprises. In East Africa too, for the same reasons, I believe that experience will soon show that, even if the economic activities of the colonial companies are not managed by the government, it is still possible to run a charter colony. Wherever I am economically active, I stand on the ground that I consider it not only morally desirable, but also politically and governmentally necessary, to appeal to the own strength of those perions that come together to achieve certain economic goals at home or abroad. In my overall view, state aid should only be provided in cases of this kind if either the future holds great prospects and the means to achieve the goal are currently lacking, or if higher considerations, such as railroad interest guarantees, etc., justify state intervention, or if the tasks to be solved cannot be solved by private individuals at all. As far as the application of such principles to our territories is concerned, we may study them as much as we like, we may discuss and comment on the way in which our colonies are to be developed formally and financially at the green table, but in my opinion we will not come to a conclusion as to which structure is best suited to the situation. We must first gather experience and, according to the experience and characteristics of the individual areas, apply the means and establish the facilities that are most appropriate. For my part, I am not concerned that we will receive a project from the Reich government next fall or winter with the proposed bill, which will in any case be preceded by an agreement with the German East African Society, which will require us to give our consent, that our entire German East African protectorate with the coastal strips belonging to the Sultan's sovereignty will be transformed into a complete Crown or Laois colony, I cannot even envisage that the Imperial Government will be able to give us an absolutely clear picture of its final and conclusive plans immediately. I am convinced, however, that the Imperial Government will direct its efforts, and successfully so, towards inducing the German East African Society to contribute, in a manner and to an extent commensurate with its powers and its tasks, to the costs of maintaining order within its territory of interest and also to the fight against the slave trade. It is doubtful to me, as I have said, whether this can be permanently regulated so soon according to a certain principle; however, I attach secondary importance to this for the time being. I would only like to express the wish that if, as I hope, the allied governments make a submission in the next session, the support of the members of the Center for the pursuit of a prudent colonial policy by the Imperial Government will be all the less withdrawn, as the motion submitted by the Center in 1888 was in fact the starting point for the actual intervention of the Empire in East Africa. I have already said that I am grateful to Mr. Windthorst for the kindness with which he is now drawing the consequences of his motion of that time. If he makes his willingness to support German action in East Africa dependent on a careful consideration of whether the funds requested by the Reich are within the limits of the programme he has approved and is now following, I can assure him that I, too, will only approve the Reich's expenditure for colonial purposes after a conscientious examination and will support the civilizing tasks at the same time as the economic ones. In the form of the Rules of Procedure, I cannot bring about a formal concession on the part of Mr. Windthorft; however, I would like to reiterate my conviction that, just as he drew the consequences of his earlier views and his earlier motion today, he will also in future allow the sentence to be acknowledged: "A German Reich government. which pursues Germany's economic and cultural goals in East Africa in a prudent, economical and adventure-avoiding manner, as has been the case over the past year, deserves and rightly demands further support from all parties in this House". . . . Greater Namaland. Fate took me to South Africa several years ago, my specific destination was Greater Namaland. My hopes were not too high, everything I had heard and read about the country was unfavorable, even in Cape Town I was warned against going there with well-meaning intentions by people who had never seen the country. The first impression I got when I arrived on the coast was, however, such as to confirm and even surpass everything bad that has ever been said about the unfortunate country. The Englishman is too little able to imagine a real desert and must be astounded by its absolute emptiness. It was not much better for me further inland, where there can no longer be any talk of a desert. I made my first journey there shortly before the rainy season, in the time of the greatest drought, when the withered grass, bent by the wind, the rigid leafless bushes were incapable of giving life and charm to the landscape. Here I fell into the mistake of most travelers, I involuntarily drew a parallel in my mind between the South African inland landscape at its worst and between Europe at its best. I was comparing the time of the vegetation break here with the time of life there. That was a serious mistake on my part. If I had compared, how cheaply, the dead landscape lying there in pale yellow and gray and the delicious air enveloping me with Europe lying there under the winter shroud, with its snowstorms and freezing rain. truly Africa would have come off better. I was soon brought to a better realization when I reached the first native village. This was, as always, situated at a permanent waterhole, where the groundwater was not deep in the ground. Even though the grass had been completely eaten away and the numerous fodder bushes were all but short stumps in a wide radius, tall old trees with magnificent evergreen crowns adorned the place, interspersed with younger growth. It was mainly the beautiful Acacia horrida, which can be found everywhere in the country where its deep roots are able to reach some moisture, or where its location is soaked at least once a year, as is the case along the numerous periodic river courses. This "Dornboom" provides an excellent gum arabic, its bark also a valued tanning agent, of which latter property it unfortunately falls victim all too often My opinion of the country was even more thoroughly changed when I became acquainted with the carefree, cheerful hustle and bustle of the inhabitants and their beautiful herds of cattle. The latter were not only handsome animals, but also in excellent feeding condition, and I was taught here that even the withered, dead grass and the leafless fodder bushes provide nutritious fodder in indestructible quantities. I traveled around the country for another 2½ years; the purpose was not scientific research, not the search for gold and diamonds, not trade interests, not hunting. Although all this was not without interest for me, the main purpose of my travels was to examine the country to see whether and to what extent it is possible for Europeans to settle there, what preconditions and capital investments are necessary for this, and finally, what successes can be expected there with some certainty. In order to be able to form a reliable judgment, I had to get to know the country in its various vegetation periods, its natural trade connections, the labor and political conditions, I had to make comparisons with the country untouched by culture and the copolony inhabited by Europeans for centuries. In order to do this as thoroughly as possible, I limited myself to a relatively small area, i.e. small for Africa; the Greater Namaland I traveled through, which we can assume to extend from the Orange River to the Spakop, and east to 20° east longitude of Greenwich, measures over 7000 German square miles, i.e. is significantly larger than the Prussian monarchy. I have seen and heard more than any traveler before me, indeed more than the missionaries who have lived in the country for a long time and who are usually tied to one place by their life's occupation, but I have often made use of the experiences of these good men.

The attentive reader will perhaps have been able to form his own judgment from them, which may occasionally differ from mine, but I am happy to comply with the request addressed to me to reproduce my judgment here shortly. All travelers agree in their reports about the healthy climate of the country, which is extremely agreeable to Europeans, unfortunately also about the desolate desert strip of about 50 nant. miles wide, which separates the hinterland from the coast and causes great, though not insurmountable, difficulties for traffic from the coast to the interior. I must add that an almost equally wide strip of desert stretches along the Orange River, starting from the coast and gradually becoming narrower the further it moves away from it. There are also scattered smaller strips in the interior which, for reasons that have not yet been sufficiently clarified, are so barren that they must be described as desert. All in all, I count a full third of the country as desert and permanently uninhabitable. If I find myself in contradiction here with Dr. Pechuel-Loesche, who counts only 4 percent as desert, this may have its reason in the fact that everyone understands something different by desert. I include in this category areas which in normal years offer so little fodder plants that utilization by cattle grazing is impossible. Strictly speaking, these areas are not all deserted, i.e. without vegetation; a surprisingly strong population of game has usually retreated to such areas, and in exceptionally rainy years a rich flora develops here, only to disappear for many years. There is no conscientious observation over a longer period of time anywhere Individual missionaries have measured and noted the rainfall, but unfortunately the measurements were taken for too short a time and remained incomplete. In Rehoboth, for example, missionary Heydmann measured 103 millimetres - approx. 4 English inches - in one year, and 333 millimetres - 13½ English inches - in 10 months the following year. The Cape Colony has an average rainfall of 12 inches, South Anstralia 21 inches. It should be noted here that Rehoboth is by no means better situated in terms of rainfall than the other habitable parts of Greater Namaland. Even if these few collected figures cannot mean much, one can see from them that the rainfall is not great and very irregular. Nevertheless, it is sufficient to produce a vegetation that is able to feed enormous herds of domestic animals, it is sufficient to maintain groundwater everywhere, which feeds numerous, often quite strong springs without interruption, and which allows water to be brought to the surface through shallow wells almost everywhere in the country. However, the rainfall is not sufficient to be able to grow crops and horticulture without artificial irrigation. The former would perhaps be possible in very isolated districts that are still within the fertile Jone, but close enough to the coast to be able to benefit from the winter mists that often come from the sea and usually intensify until it rains. Years ago, such an attempt was made with success, but the conditions for the vines were so difficult that it remained one lucky attempt. This grain ban will never achieve any significance. If, on the other hand, the good soil and the beautiful climate are helped by future irrigation, the richest harvests can be obtained and the most varied fruits cultivated. I refer to my reports on the garden of the missionary Mr. Judt in Hoachanas in No. 26 of this year's Z. Z. v. Jahrg. and about the garden in Bethany. All the missionaries in the country, followed by some natives, on the Orange River Mr. Dominicus in Stolzenfels and Mr. Petersen in Außenkehr cultivate large areas by artificial irrigation, indeed an Englishman, Mr. Hill in Grundorn, has had a well dug 30 feet deep to water a garden of about 2 acres. Since the climate allows horticulture all year round with irrigation and fertilizer is always available in abundance, small areas here achieve much more than in Europe. Most of the water available in the country is not used today and I dare say that it is undoubtedly possible for the immigrant European to cultivate so much horticulture without large capital investments in order to produce the plant food necessary for his family himself. In order to prevent unfulfilled hopes from arising from the outset, I must contradict what Mr. Nolte says in No. 5 of the 1888 issue of the newspaper. Mr. Nolte, whose remarks I would like to endorse in almost all points, says that larger irrigation systems will bring back the investment capital to an industrious arable farmer in the first two years. This is future music. To begin with, I am against any large capital investment and only in favor of the most original investments to cover one's own needs. A capital investment presupposes a return, but where is this to come from when the most difficult transport and trade conditions make sales impossible When trade conditions and means of transportation have improved due to cheaply produced and expensive livestock products, when a stronger population has been lured into the country by fortunate ore discoveries, which is also solvent, then it is time to think about such capital investments, and then they will also pay off in a short time. Then all the investments which have been made on the largest scale in the Cape Colony and Australia and which produce rich values will be possible here. But before this happens, by careful use of the springs, by primitive water collection and by cultivation of the not too rare groundwater sources, a lot of usable water can be obtained without great capital expenditure, apart from our own needs. In order to start with a natural product of the country, I recommend that Acacia horrida, which produces gum arabic, first be protected and then propagated by planting. Then I recommend the planting of mulberry trees to cultivate silk, which can certainly be done outdoors without protective buildings, as in southern China; and I also recommend the cultivation of grapevines to produce raisins. The trading conditions in Great Namaland are the most unfavorable imaginable. The best staple article in the country was ostrich feathers, which are no longer available. Gum arabic is abundant in the country, but there are no hands to collect it and the transportation conditions make it difficult to use. The most important barter item is cattle for slaughter and its utilization is naturally tied to the few South African market places such as Cape Town, Kimberley and Okiep. Here, the price of animals will be depressed beyond all reason in the future. A change for the better can only be brought about if easily transportable staple livestock products are created in significant quantities, such as wool and mohair. Both species, wool sheep and augora goats, are easy to breed here in unlimited numbers without any other capital investment than the introduction of the parent animals. Both raw materials are articles of daily use, the necessity of which increases with every day, which can be piled up for a long time, and which can be sold everywhere and always. The English colonies, especially Australia, as well as the Argentine Republic, owe far more of their prosperity to this product than to gold and the products of land cultivation put together. It is also worth noting that colonial wool production has already outstripped that of Europe; so when a German colony enters the world market with this product, it is competing with other colonies, but not with the mother country, which would probably happen if Greater Namaland had the prospect of being able to develop as a farming colony. The wool and mohair could then be joined by salted hides as a staple article. The labor situation is quite unfavorable. At most 24,000 people live in the whole of the large country, and they are extremely reluctant to work. An improvement of these conditions in the country on their own is out of the question. With patience and time, the immigrant European can train a few workers, most easily as shepherds and transport helpers. The natives will never make friends with the work on their own. The few natives are naturally good-natured and have no thought of harming the European, but like all wild and semi-wild peoples, they are constantly feuding with each other, which ultimately amounts to stealing as much as possible from their neighbor. The Europeans living in between are severely affected by this eternal unrest. Passing hordes of warriors make heavy demands on his hospitality, trade falters, the people become more and more impoverished, for the happy victor never knows how long he can enjoy the booty he has gained and slaughters it diligently or sells it at knock-down prices in order to enjoy it until he himself finally has nothing left. In the end, hunger torments everyone and then even the Europeans find it difficult to protect their property from theft. From all this it is clear that Great Namaland will not attain any importance until European settlers move there, but it is also clear that these settlers find there a quite good area to bring their labor to bear, that they can lead a carefree life there, far removed from all European culture and its pleasures, and leave their descendants a not insignificant wealth. Here, as everywhere else, the settler must have a small fortune to start with, to buy food for the first few months,

Page 158

of dairy and harness animals, equipment, etc. If someone has a fortune of 10,000 to 12,000 marks, he can start on a large scale right away and, with some prudence and energy, become a large-scale farmer in a few years. With less initial capital, of course, the process is correspondingly slower. The man needs an ox wagon Mark 1800 one chuck oxen, 14 animals at 80 Mark 1120 10 dairy cows at 60 Mark 2 brood mares at 300 Mark 50 Merino ewes at 15 Mark goats at 40 Mark 50 African goats and goats at 10 Mark food for one year 1000 tools and barter items. 1000 in total: Mark 7410 This would be an average start, if the settler is able to acquire a larger stock of Merino sheep and possibly a stock of Angora goats right at the beginning, he can count on an income for wool and mohair all the sooner, for which he can buy clothes and other necessities. He must live from milk, hunting and, in his second year, from the garden. He must not slaughter too many of his animals at the beginning. The house must be built free of charge from materials from the land and by his own labor, the mild climate here requires only very simple and light buildings. Stone construction in clay and a grass roof on top is sufficient. Roof rafters can be found, albeit after a long search, among the native woods, which unfortunately have a tendency to grow very crooked. It would be questionable to start with significantly fewer resources, as misery would then come knocking at the door at the slightest accident. A significant difficulty for immigration to Great Namaland from Europe or Germany lies in the expensive travel costs. From Hamburg to New Pork the fare is 96 Marks for an adult in third class, from Hamburg to Cape Town 00 Marks. From here there is currently no regular connection to Lüderitzbucht and Walfischbai, so a longer and very expensive stay there in Cape Town is the rule, then it costs another 100 marks from Cape Town to Lüderitzbucht. Once on the coast, the immigrant finds nothing, not even drinking water. Once the man has finally overcome all the difficulties, he finds himself lonely and abandoned in a completely wild and, according to the views he has brought with him from Europe, barren country. If food worries and misfortune are added to this, it does not take much prophecy for disappointment, pusillanimity and even despondency to creep into the mind of the newcomer. Here is an opportunity to first use German capital profitably for colonial endeavors. The matter must be organized. First of all, it would be necessary to set up a kind of model farm, but without any glamor, simple and appropriate to its purpose, large enough to provide the settlers with breeding animals, at least those that are not available in the country, such as wool sheep and Angora goats. If a larger company decides to emigrate, contact should be made with a German line, e.g. Wörmann in Hamburg, to transport the people directly to Lüderitzbucht or Walsischbai, which would save at least 100 marks per person. Leading personalities in Africa should be notified of the arrival as precisely as possible in advance so that the people can be transported into the country as soon as possible. Instead of sending them into the wilderness, they must be given hospitality on the farm, they must be shown what can be achieved in the country through work, and finally they must be supported with advice and assistance when they finally settle down. It is not at all necessary for all these services to be provided free of charge, but it might be advisable to grant a loan to those who do not have enough wealth to pay for everything, which they can amortize in 24 years at 8 percent. The usual ox wagons in the country can be brought to the coast from Cape Town in advance, as can the heavy bread. Once there are a few dozen settlers in the country and they are established, settled and prospering, things become much easier, if not self-evident. Good news will attract relatives and acquaintances, and the old settlers will help the newcomers. The important thing is that the first news is good. If they are unfavorable, it is to be expected that a longer setback will follow.
Mr. Nolte's fear, expressed some time ago, that if immigration from Germany is delayed for any length of time, Boers from the Cape Colony and the other Fijian territories will eventually invade and occupy the best places in advance, is not at all far-fetched. These people have a tremendous head start over new settlers from Europe. They know the country and the people, are familiar with the way of life and the economic conditions, own larger herds of cattle and ox wagons, and finally have the necessary degree of impudence that is so beneficial to the courageous in a wild country. Already north of the Orange River in the German protectorate, mostly near Warmbad, live 44 families of European descent, who are only prevented by the predatory war of Hendrik Witboi from choosing the most beautiful watering places and grazing grounds further north. I consider the northernmost part of Greater Ramaland, that between Swakop and 25½ degrees latitude, to be the most suitable for immigration. For various practical reasons it is desirable that the settlers should not be scattered among the natives, but live closer together in separate districts. The least reason is not the mutual protection which they can thus afford each other in case of danger, while scattered individually they are exposed to every chance. The German Empire has a protection force of 50 men there, which seems a small force in Europe, but it is a very respectable one for South Africa. It is impossible for a company of soldiers to march along behind every gold prospector or homesteader, but a few hundred settlers living together in a relatively confined space can be protected by the militarily organized Schutztruppe (protection force) against gross attacks by predatory or insolent natives. This is facilitated by the fact that every settler is one more soldier in an emergency. Now the greatest difficulties for a European force in the country are not caused by the number and fighting spirit of the enemy, but by the enormous distances. If the Europeans live together, this main difficulty is eliminated. On the whole, the natives will only feel at home as servants among the Europeans; the wealthy, proud Nama will avoid this district, firstly out of pride and above all because he lacks the concept of personal property and attachment to a particular place of residence. In the part inhabited by Europeans, a simple unwritten law must be introduced very soon, because of the use of water, cattle damage. Hunting rights, etc. The natives will find this difficult to comply with. The majority of the Nama tribes and especially the southern ones have always been very peaceful and even very friendly towards Europeans, especially those in Warmbad, Bethany and Keimanshoop; the people there occupy the best places, so why displace them? The north is home to the most restless tribes, the worst of which is the Gibeon. These tribes have almost worn themselves out through eternal wars and are totally impoverished, so that today a beautiful fertile area of 1500 German square miles lies completely deserted. Dr. Bernhard Schwarz, who has travelled a very small part in the far north, did not particularly like the country, and yet he himself often speaks of the "immense plains with high dense grass, groups of trees and grazing animals in between." What more does Dr. Schwarz want, does he want to find laughing villages among these lazy natives who think it is foolish to plant a tree? An old countryman's heart is gladdened by this view, perhaps more than by palm forests and the most luxuriant creepers, from which no goat can get enough, he knows what can be made of such land. However, the Rehoboth Bastards live in this area, peaceful, industrious and orderly people, a very good cultural element. Since they only have a district of about 300 square miles, there is still enough left. The Rehoboths can be left completely undisturbed. If the remaining 1200 square miles are occupied, with only one settler per square mile, the country will have a different appearance. If we reckon only 1000 wool sheep for every settler, that would be 1,200,000 wool sheep, which would yield at least an annual wool yield of 2,400,000 marks and, what is the main thing, in an excellent staple article. Then the trade will develop by itself; traffic routes will arise; the country itself can raise the means for a regulated administration. There is no question that here, more than elsewhere, the natives will not be able to withstand the harsh impact of civilization. The philanthropist can complain about it, but the brutal fact cannot be changed. The savage wants to enjoy without working, and that is impossible. The Nama will soon ruin himself, gradually giving way to the Furopean through his own recklessness.

and we can only be satisfied if some of them remain as workers. If only the beginning has been made, the rest will take care of itself I would like to draw attention to something which, in my opinion, has not been sufficiently appreciated for a long time. If you follow the history of all the gold-producing countries closely, you will find that a settlement, however sparse, preceded their mining development. Anyone who wants to set up Mexico and Peru as counterparts is mistaken, because the Europeans found these countries already populated, there was a high culture there before them. It just so happens that today these countries are not among the gold-producing countries. Anyone familiar with gold prospecting will realize that this cannot be otherwise. Dr. Schwarz's little book "Im deutschen Goldlande" is extremely instructive in this respect, for Dr. Schwarz was a practical gold prospector, and even if he describes his personal suffering, loss of body weight, etc. in somewhat drastic terms, it is nevertheless clear to see from it what difficulties the gold prospector has to contend with in a wild country. It is always felt first by the poorer prospector, who works for his own account, tirelessly climbing around between the rocks for years and striking as many stones as possible. Gold is a rare metal, otherwise it would not be so expensive, finding it is always a lucky coincidence, practice gives us some clues, but science still lets us down here. The more people search for it, the more often this lucky coincidence can play its game. A fleeting expedition that soon runs out of cocoa and canned food can achieve nothing; the real gold digger, on the other hand, lives with a settler for months, uses the local knowledge of this man and his people, thoroughly investigates the area from here and goes from one to the other until luck smiles on him. Poor rascals! Only a few will smile, and the ponderous farmer who looks for the gold in his sheep's fleece and is sure to find it will usually see his guest, whom he gladly accommodates, depart without envy. But if the latter has been happy, then the farmer has no reason to envy, for now his sure harvest of gold really begins, he no longer finds the bright, six and ready minted twenty-mark pieces in his sheep's pen alone, they are then also lying in the vegetable patch of his well-watered garden, hanging on the grapevine, hanging on the golden ear of wheat. I also don't understand how one can go mining in a country that lies fallow far from the coast, where there are no farmers to bring meat, bread, milk and vegetables to the miner. Transvaal, which is always praised for its fertility and where more than 15,000 farmers have already settled, can no longer feed its 40,000 people employed in mining; in August and September 1889, a pound of flour went up to one mark and an ox to the fabulous price of 300 marks for South Africa, famine broke out and epidemics broke out until the high prices attracted larger supplies from further afield. So, you may turn the matter around and look at it from all sides, nothing will come of the German West African protectorate without settlement. And do we have anything to be angry about? Does Germany, does Europe have so few people that it can't deliver any? I don't need to answer that at all. But that this settlement is quite possible must be admitted by every unbiased person who has come to know the country and who can judge it; it has already been proved here and there by facts. It is true that the country has some shortcomings, the desert strip on the coast is extremely troublesome, it would do no harm at all if the rainfall were somewhat greater, but the desert is surmountable, the rainfall not too low, and the delicious climate makes up for both. Dr. Pechuöl=Lösche hits the nail on the head when he says: "These conditions are not only damaging the German protected area, but the greater part of the whole of South Africa, where despite all this, large areas are being successfully cultivated. So just get to work, without serious and persistent work nothing can be done, there is still a wide and fertile area for the activities of colonial friends. F. Hermann. Descriptions from Cameroon. By Georg Baldau. (Continuation). When he arrived at the Elalsbause, he placed the hul on a pole sifting in front of the house, whereupon he hurriedly returned to his home. Before he had even reached it, men armed with utes and machete knives appeared from all sides, all hurrying to the building site as if they feared they were too late. Within a short time, more than 200 men had gathered there, awaiting Musakla's orders regarding the work. Ekumba=Liongo had, as already mentioned, been purchased by Kuutson on his journey up the Meme. I had hoped to be able to travel from here up the river to Ekumba=Adene (Elumbi=ba-Ndene) but now found that the village, like the other villages on the Meme, lacked a canoe, which, according to the people, was because they had been prevented by the Calabar merchants from acquiring one so that they could control the trade more safely. The land route to Ekumba=Ndene was, as they claimed, flooded and also so bad that the hammock could not be carried there. As I was of the opinion that this answer was dictated by their wish to keep me away from the interior of the country, I decided to make an attempt to get there the following day. In the meantime, several chiefs and other distinguished men arrived from the aforementioned village, bringing a goat, young chickens and bananas as gifts for me. As much as they would like to see me come to them, they explained that they did not know how this could be done, so I gave up the journey, determined to get there at the first suitable opportunity from one of the mountain villages where we were then engaged in buying rubber. Now that I had achieved the purpose of my journey, I wanted to make my way home by sea as soon as possible. For this purpose, I hired his can and three men from the Calabarmanne to take it to the village of Bamosa. The following day, June 3, we left Bonge's landing place at 9 o'clock in the morning. Driven forward by the current and 10 oars, the can glided down the river as fast as an arrow, weaving its way between the numerous tree trunks that were everywhere, many of which did not reach the surface of the water and were therefore difficult to avoid. Half an hour after our departure from Bonge, we passed the landing site of the village of Meme on the south bank and the upper landing site of the village of Kumbe opposite on the north bank. The banks, which had been very high and steep from Ekumba=Liongo onwards, began to become lower here, but were still quite respectable in height an hour further on. Only one or two tracks of elephants had been spotted on the banks at Ekumba-Liongo, but below Bonge they became more and more numerous. Below Meme, the banks were completely trampled by these huge animals for long stretches. Several tracks were only a few hours old, and at a bend in the river we saw one such animal taking a bath. Warned by the singing of the canoeists, it took to its heels and climbed up the steep and loose bank with astonishing speed. Just as it was about to disappear into the forest, I sent a bullet after it in the thigh, but as the rifle was only a small, ordinary express rifle, the shot had no particular effect. Only a few small bloodstains could be found, so after a short pursuit of the trail I continued my journey. We soon passed the lower Kumbes landing place near the village, where the river is 35 meters wide and 2½ meters deep on one bank and ½ meter deep on the other. Here the ebb and flow of the tide were already noticeable, the strength of the current had gradually diminished, and a little further down we encountered a weak counter-current, which became stronger and stronger the further down the river we went. At one point, the passage was almost completely blocked by a huge cottonwood tree that had fallen across the river from the south bank. On the northern bank, however, there was a small island and between this and the bank a 3 meter wide arm of the river, which ran through us. During the dry season, when the water here is 2-3 feet lower, even a canoe cannot get through. The bottom of the river, which had consisted of sand from Ekumba=Liongo onwards, was clay here, the users were lower and the surrounding land swampy. We soon came across a narrow, but obviously very well used footpath that led through the tall grass on the bank into the forest A little further down, a similar path was visible on the other side, in front of which, tied to poles, lay a few small trough-like cans. This narrow clayey and marshy path forms the road and the only connection between Illoani and Love, the two most important towns in Balundu. A splendid illustration of communications in Aquatorial Africa. A distance below the aforementioned path, the river divided into two branches, the narrower of which, diverging to the right, was referred to as the actual bed of the Meme. This branch, however, was completely blocked by fallen trees, so that we had to continue our journey on the left branch to a narrower channel branching off 100 meters further downstream. The 50 meter wide and straight left arm was apparently the main arm, but the Kann people called it Mongosi and claimed that it soon became lost in a number of small streams. We therefore followed the narrow channel, which was deep and free of all obstacles, and were soon back on the Meme. This is where the solid ground ends and the creek country with its mangrove forest begins. The entire land surrounding the Meme River is, in accordance with the previously described southern part of Balundu, completely flat and stone-free with a rich and fertile soil of deep clay, covered with a ½ meter thick layer of black earth. Truly a land for capitalists to make something of! It would be difficult to find a richer land better suited for plantations. Especially for

Page 160

it is very suitable for the cultivation of cocoa, sugar and tobacco. Plantations on the Meme would have a deep, extremely fertile and stoneless soil, great warmth, abundant dew and rain, as well as easy and cheap communication with ports on the coast - and what more could one wish for! The greater part of the land near the river is being or has been used by the natives as farms, so that the greater part of the tall forest has been cut down and replaced on the abandoned farms by a dense, bush-like young wood, over which tall olvalms and here and there a giant cotton tree tower. On the new farms the palms are still quite low and the place of the young wood is taken by extensive banana and plantain groves as well as corn and bean fields. On the actual river slope, however, the old trees have been left standing and these now form a shady vault over the river for long stretches. It is extremely pleasant to take a canoe trip down the river on a fine, cool morning. With great speed, but almost silently propelled by the current and oars, the vehicle glides along, sometimes between steep, vertically sloping banks, sometimes under a low, shady arch, which suddenly gives way to an open, sunlit terrain with dense banana plantations or low bushes, over which palm trees proudly raise their bush-like crowns. The only thing you are bothered by is a lot of blood-sucking and very intrusive horseflies. Fish shower at the water's edge, snapping at insects, and fluttering butterflies and buzzing damselflies hover above. Noisy flocks of gray and red parrots lend the landscape a lively air, and the numerous, often fresh tracks of elephants keep the traveler's mind in constant suspense. At every new bend in the river, the gaze passes quickly and peeringly over the stream and the users downstream, expecting to see one of these huge animals taking a refreshing dip in the lonely river During my later journeys there, I have observed such scenes several times without being able to bring myself to disturb them, despite the fact that my rifle lay loaded beside me. But as soon as the animal, noticing our presence, took to its heels, the enchantment was broken and the hunt was at its rightful place. When one sees the elephant in Enropa, it appears disproportionately large and one is inclined to see in it a remnant of a vanished gigantic animal and plant world, i.e. a creature that must disappear from the earth. The impression it makes is quite different when you see it in the primeval forests of its tropical homeland. Among the trees, up to 200 feet high and unbelievably thick, between the enormous leafy plants and in the more than dwarf height of the same, it appears as a worthy representative of the animal kingdom, while the other animals look ridiculously small and insignificant. It is a pity that it was not possible to tame him. Perhaps because they didn't go about it the right way. Why not use the same method to tame it that is used for its relative, the Asian elephant? If skillful elephant hunters and good "sirens" were brought to a suitable place in Agopten or Zanzibar in India, it might be possible to tame and train it. This would provide the "black continent" with a suitable and good means of transportation, which it needs more than any other. The creaky part of the Meme, between the Mongosi and the estuary, took more than two hours to travel due to the counter-current. This part has several side channels and resembles an ordinary creak, with the difference, however, that here and there the bottom is somewhat firmer and densely overgrown with rasiapalms. I have never encountered such masses of this tree as here. The whole of Balundu=, Vonge= and Ekumbiland could cut their timber here. We encountered a Calabar cane here, similar to the one I had. I would like to give a description of these strange vehicles, which are used for the unheard-of trade throughout Old Calabar. In order to be usable for the transport of heavy rum and oil barrels, in which it often happens that, heavily loaded, they run aground on cliffs or tree trunks at full speed, they are built very thick and are therefore very heavy and clumsy. Moreover, as they are only intended for calm water, their shape is completely straight, lacking any protrusion in the front or rear, and they differ greatly from the light, supple and graceful sea canoes, in the construction of which the Betikkavolk in particular have acquired great skill. There are Calabarkanus of extraordinary size; in particular, they are characterized by considerable depth and width. The largest one I saw was 20 meters long. 2.5 meters wide and 1.5 meters deep, but there are said to be even larger ones. All these canoes, both large and small, are covered in the middle with a small roof made from the leaves of the rasa palm, and under this roof they have a floor made of boards; this is where the owner of the canoe has his sleeping place and where he also keeps his more delicate trade goods. This shed provides good and much-needed protection against rain and sunshine during the journeys on the endless creaks, which often last several days and where not a foot of solid ground is encountered, so that the travelers are exclusively dependent on the can. In the front part of each can there is a platform of clay and sand, which is used as a stove. In relation to their size and weight, these canoes generally have a very small crew, but they are able to push the craft up the river using long poles. In the creeks, the tide flowing through them at high speed is used as the driving force. As long as the tide is favorable, the boat is allowed to drift with the current, whereby the crew only has to help a little with the oars and steer the craft into the right channels. As soon as the current turns, the can is tied to the roots of a mangrove tree until the water flows in its previous direction again after 6 hours. These journeys are extremely monotonous, but completely to the Negro's taste, for as long as the current carries him forward, he has little work to do, and when the can is tied up, he cooks, eats and sleeps. For a white man, a journey through these regions is extremely boring; always the same scenery: the eternal, meandering creeks with their salty, murky water, the monocone mangrove forest, resting on millions of aerial roots that rise out of the mud at low water, covered with green, stinking slime, with earth and water snails. The monotony of this wasteland is interrupted by an unusually rich animal life in one or other of the larger creels. Here and there you can see a crocodile slowly rutting through the mud towards the water, in which it disappears before you can get within shooting range. Herons snap at young frogs, which frolic around in large numbers on the banks. Pelicans are slowly but surely filling their large food pools with wriggling fish. Several species of eagles, hawks and harriers soar above the treetops or sit philosophizing on a branch that shoots out high above the creek. The proud eagle, which sits there as motionless as a statue, sees the vehicle approaching, but knows from experience that he can be perfectly safe from the black man, and as he has no reason to expect anything else from the white one, he remains calmly seated until he is suddenly startled out of his musings by a shot, which throws him head over heels into the water. Most of the life in these areas is given by the parrots, which often migrate in large flocks across the creek with incessant screaming and whistling. In one or other of the lonely canals these birds have their night quarters, for which certain trees are always chosen and occupied by hundreds of thousands of birds to the point of crowding, while the surrounding trees remain untouched. The natives know many of these places and use their knowledge to catch the parrots alive with glue rods which they attach to the trees. In the mornings and evenings, you can sometimes see whole flocks of meerkats among the tree trunks and aerial roots, from which they can hardly be distinguished due to their dark coloration in the semi-darkness under the foliage. During the hottest hours of the day, all life seems to be virtually extinct, and only the melancholy cry of a large monkey, recurring with long intervals, interrupts the silence of the wasteland. The Meme flows into the Ndame at a right angle to the course of this river, which is about 1 kilometer long at this point. My men had a hard job here in the strong counter-current, but by steering close to the bank we managed to make fairly good progress. After a few hours, the current turned and helped us to move forward quickly. The Ndame narrowed in a few places to only a few hundred meters, but widened towards the mouth to a width of 2 kilometers. Near its mouth, on the left bank between the mangrove trees, was a small, miserable fishing village inhabited by Fialis. This is the only village this people still have on the mainland, from which they were expelled a few years ago. When we arrived at the outermost tip of the right user, called Pelikanspitze, large white waves came towards us, which were difficult enough to pass with our flat and heavy can, but thanks to the strong arms and the skill of my crewmen in steering the can, we happily made it across the 3 kilometer wide Pan to the left bank, where we were protected from the waves by sandbanks. The sun was now setting, and after another hour's sail, and now in the dark, we reached Bamoso, where we would have had to sit on a sandbank at the mouth of the Molande. From some fish that we had managed to buy and some rice that we had brought with us, we prepared an evening meal that tasted excellent after fasting for 13 hours. As neither I nor my people were able to sleep in this mosquito nest, I decided to continue the journey to Bibundi that night. For this trip I hired a large sea can and 5 oarsmen to spare my men, who had been working non-stop since 9 o'clock in the morning. We embarked at 11 o'clock in the afternoon. This journey in the dark night was a rather adventurous one. One rainy wind followed another, the sea was rough, and twice we ran into high surf at the mouth of a river, which we couldn't see in the dark. Towards morning it cleared up and at sunrise we headed for Bibundi. Fehel nor Ekombi-ba-Adene. - Trade in the northern Cameroonarbirt. - Tie Unla#e dor Faltoreien. - Flantages. - The Uebeiterfroge. - The development of the Reger in English and German regions. - The progress of the Komerunland. One month after returning from the journey described above, I was on the mountain in the village of Vokulu to buy rubber. The rainy season had meanwhile set in, and for several days it rained so heavily that if I had set out for Ekumbi=ba=Ndene, where I intended to travel, it would have been impossible for me to make observations and notes. On marches in the rainy season, an umbrella is of no use; you get just as wet as if you didn't have one. Moreover, umbrellas are only a hindrance on the narrow, overgrown paths where you get stuck with them at every step you take. Soon, however, there were a few days when the rain came down with less force and the sun came out from time to time. I used sosort

I was aware of this change in the weather and set off on July 16, taking three porters and a dolman with me. Initially, the route led us through areas I had visited before, via Kokke, Monjange, Bodongo and other villages down to Konde. From there we took the path to N 10° 0 through a dense forest criss-crossed by elephant paths. After a march of 7 kilometers, during which we had the Sombe River on our left, we crossed this river at the same place where Knutson and I crossed it in 1885. On the other side lies the village of Sombe, which was now very dilapidated. Many of the houses were closed and had evidently been abandoned for a long time; the Ekals' houses had also collapsed, which was the best proof that the village was in a state of decline and decay. It was said that the inhabitants had gone to a distant country to buy slaves, but it is most likely that they had left the village as a result of war or for some other reason and settled elsewhere. The house of the first chief, to whom I was first taken, was one of the most dilapidated. The roof resembled a large-holed sieve, and the walls were in danger of collapsing. I therefore preferred to look for another place to stay and found one in a well-appointed house belonging to one of the lower chiefs. Early the next day I set off, followed by my landlord as a guide, forded the raging Sombe a little further downstream than the day before and continued the march to N 12°0 on an overgrown, clayey and partially flooded wige. A heavy and persistent rain added to the discomfort of the march. In the densest part of the forest, we crossed a river similar to the Ekundo, with a depth of 3 meters and a width of 10 meters. The bed consisted of black mud and the very dark water flowed with an almost imperceptible current in a westerly direction towards the Sombe. Already at a distance of 2 kilometers from the Meme, Ekumba=Adenes plants began to grow, extending all the way to the river. The roar of the fall could now be clearly heard and became stronger and stronger the closer we got to the river, and in the same proportion as this happened, the elephant tracks became more and more numerous until the path was finally completely trampled. Finally we stood on the banks of the Meme, a few hundred meters above the Düben Falls. A path coming from Foe also ended here. For us, who were used to the small and raging mountain streams, the Neme at this point with its calm, approximately 20 m wide water surface was an impressive sight. A can was moored in a small bay on the other bank, and several foemen were gathered on the shore, ready to embark. As soon as the crew of the can had recovered from the surprise caused by my unexpected appearance, they pushed off to fetch me across. Although she only had thick sticks instead of oars, she propelled the can forward at a good speed. Because of the strong current, they steered along the bank a little way up the river and then over to the other side, where the current led the can in an arc down to the landing place. The current here went down towards the trap in the direction of 8 65° V.*) Once we reached the other user, we followed a clayey path along the river, torn apart by the rainwater, which then led steeply up to the village of Ekumba Adene, 0.8 um from the river. This village had three streets with a total of 130 houses, which looked similar to those in Ekumba=Liongo, although they were not as well maintained as those. The streets of the village were overgrown with grass. As I learned much later, it was only half of the village that I saw here; the other part, which is a good distance away, is, I was told, about the same size, but the village as a whole must number about 250 houses and is worthy of its name, which means Great Ekumbi. The first chief, an old man with gray hair and beard, immediately arranged a spacious house with two rooms for me, and the village presented me with a goat and a few bunches of plantains, which were immediately given to the cook. After I had taken a bath and put dry clothes on my body, the palaver about the purchase of the village began, which was completed after a few hours. After a hearty breakfast the following morning, we set off. As a parting gift, the chief presented me with a handsome rooster; however, it was not used for this purpose, but after a few days in Bidundi you could see it proudly walking around at the head of a large harem. The way back was via the landing play below the fall, where the path led through deep hollows that had been dug out of the clay by the torrential rains. When it rains heavily, this path turns into a raging river and it is then impossible to use it. It ended 1.5 km from the village at a creak-like stream into which the water of the Meme flowed. This point is about 125 meters lower than the village and is the furthest point that can be reached by canoe from the river. However, this is only possible for a short time. During most of the year the passage is blocked by a few smaller falls further down. The canal was about 6 m wide and 100 m long with 10 m high, vertical banks. We descended it in a small canal and then crossed the Meme, which was about 30 m wide and very deep at this point and flowed at great speed and with a swirling current to 8 80° V. After we had passed the plains, we came to the same path on which we had arrived the previous day. We stopped for a few minutes at the village of Sombe to pay the *) For a description of the case, see Ymer 1837. pp. 228-230.
The march was then continued without interruption to Konde and then back up the mountain to Bokulu. With Ekumbi=ba=Ndene, the entire Balunduland south of the Memne and 4-5 kilometers of land on both sides of the river from the mouth up to the Dübenfall had come into our possession. This possession forms a contiguous area comprising 10 villages with 6000-7000 inhabitants and an area of 21-3 Swedish □ miles (250 to 300 □ kilometers). At least three quarters of this area is bathed by the most fertile soil imaginable. The whole country is irrigated by numerous rivers and streams. The southern Balunduland has three harbors on the border of the Creekland, and the rest of the country is traversed by the Meme River, which can also be navigated in canoes during the dry season. The country is therefore unusually rich in convenient communications and thus possesses one of the most important means of progress. It had now become our moral duty to contribute to this progress. First and foremost, this could be done by freeing the people from the credit system of the Calabar merchants and the dependence and slavery they had lost as a result, as well as by a strong presence with sufficient power to maintain peace and order in the country for the benefit of trade and traffic. In addition, factories would have to be established on Balundus Greekhäfen and along the Meme, which, apart from our interests, would contribute greatly to the upliftment of the country in several respects. The certainty of always being able to sell the products in the factories and of being paid much better than before would drive the people to greater diligence and greater productivity. Here, however, is a dark point, for the same cause can have quite the opposite effect on the villages near the factories, in that the latter monopolize direct trade with the factories for themselves and act as intermediaries between the whites and the interior. This brings us to the pernicious commission trade, the blight on all trade and commerce in Africa, the obstacle to the penetration of Europeans into the country, that which demoralizes the coastal population, makes them lazy and unproductive and has a depressing effect on the population of the interior. As a result of this trade, the interior tribes are paid so little for their labor that they are not encouraged to peoduce more than is absolutely necessary to provide themselves with the bare necessities, such as salt, guns and powder. Guns and powder, whereas they make their own grass, iron tools, clay pots and the like, which are too expensive for them to run. (To be continued.) Correspondence. (From German Guinca we receive the following letter: Siar, February 25, 1830. For several days we have had Mr. Blunkschli, the bend-manager of a deli company, visiting us here. He has inspected the land in our area and intends - subject to the approval of his Bremen board - to start six large tobacco plantations here towards the end of the year and to bring 600 to 1000 workers - Chinese and Malays - with him. One of the Germans present here accompanied him on various tours, including to a 1300-foot high mountain to give the guest a view of the Astrolabe plain from there. They went through thick and thin, through jungle and creepers on single-origin paths; they also had to ford swamps and rivers. Finally, climbing was necessary on sometimes quite steep and slippery paths. The two white men were accompanied by natives who would have found it difficult to return without them. - The native recognizes the weakest footsteps, and he can easily find the human ferry on broken stalks, leaves and branches. - The travelers arrived on the mountain, albeit completely wet from river water and sweat, but otherwise happy and were rewarded for all the toil and discomfort of the march by a magnificent view of the vast Astrolabe Bay, the plain spreading out around it and the mountain ranges rising from it. Involuntarily, the travelers also thought back to many a magnificent picture at home. Unfortunately, the horizon was not completely free of haze; otherwise the view would have been even more beautiful, and the Finisterre mountains with their giant peaks would have come into their own. There are two villages on the verge we visited, some of whose inhabitants already knew one of the white arrivals and had already visited him in his settlement on Siar. It was therefore not difficult to obtain pams and coconuts. The former, roasted, and the canned food they had taken with them, warmed, formed the midday meal which the two whites, as the first on this mountain, ate and which is said to have tasted excellent. - In the afternoon of the same day, the latter returned to the Germans' settlement, where they arrived in good health without having been infected by the dreaded plague. The two gentlemen also visited the Alexishafen a few days ago, which, to their surprise, proved to be an even larger harbor than the Friedrich-Wilhelm-Hafen and extended almost as far as the former's lower Gedirgszug. The two travelers attempted to make their way up the river, which was in the rough, but unfortunately only managed to navigate a much-branched estuary delta, as they were hindered by drift and drift wood.

Mr. Blunlichli found the soil here to be particularly suitable for tobacco cultivation. Everything else will depend on what concessions the New Guinea Company makes. Above all, Mr. Bluntschli requires a fourteen-day connection with Java. Bogadjim, March 4, 1890 I have been in Bogadjim again for a few days, partly for the mail and partly to discuss all sorts of things here. The occupation of the Solomon Islands will probably not happen this year. The shipping opportunity we were hoping for is too long in coming. In the next few days we want to sail to Dampier= and Richard=Jsland and, if we find the conditions there as we hope here, start setting up a station as soon as possible. A few days ago the "Ottilie" from Finschhafen brought us the news that Mr. General Director Arnold, who took up his duties at the beginning of August 1889 (see report in No." of this newspaper), died suddenly as a result of a very severe fever. The committee held a meeting on June 3 under the chairmanship of Mr. Iu. Hammacher, the Committee held a meeting at the Company's offices on June 3, at which it primarily discussed preparations for the Annual General Meeting in Cologne. The committee took note of the formation of a department in Krefeld and expressed its thanks to the gentlemen who had made a valuable contribution to the establishment of the department. The board of the department consists of the following gentlemen: Geheimer Kommerzienrat A. v. Heimendahl, chairman: Mayor E. Küper, deputy chairman; Realgymnasiallehrer Dr. Ad. Pahde. Secretary; factory owner Emil Dahl, treasurer. On the 17th, the board held a meeting under the chairmanship of Dr. Hammacher, in which questions concerning the general meeting were dealt with and the statutes of the Leisnig department were approved. Festival of the Bromberg and Tdorn departments in Schulitz. On June 8, despite unfavorable weather conditions, a number of ladies and gentlemen from the Bromberg Abseiling went to Schulitz to celebrate the foundation festival of the Leisnig branch together with the Thorn branch. After welcoming and introducing the individual participants in the hall of the Raaschlescher Gasthof, the chairman of the Bromberg detachment, Major von Bredow=Schröttersdorf, opened the meeting with a speech in which he gave an overview of the latest events in the field of colonial policy and then gave the floor to Lieutenant Märcker for a presentation on the German Schutztruppe in East Africa, which met with general applause. The boards of the two departments then met for a short business meeting. After dinner, which was enlivened by toasts, songs and, above all, a humorous festive newspaper from the Thorn department, the dancing began. For another two to three hours, the couples swayed to the sounds of the military band, then the farewell hour struck. The Zest was a complete success in every respect and will always remain a pleasant memory for the participants. Hanover department. With the lecture evening on the 11th of March, which was attended by almost a thousand people despite the fine weather, the department concluded this year's cycle of lectures. The chairman, Mr. Oberpräsident von Bennigsen, opened the meeting with a brief reference to the lectures held so far this winter, the last of which had now been taken over by Mr. Premierleutnant Giese. Mr. Giese did not speak about his experiences during the uprising, but about the country and its people in East Africa. To illustrate the character of the Negroes, the speaker cited many interesting cases from his own dealings with them and came to the conclusion that the East African Negro could very well be educated to culture and orderly poverty. And that would be the next task of the Germans in East Africa. The lecture was followed by a lengthy debate, in which Mr. von Beunigsen was primarily involved with questions about the cultural and productive capacity of the East African colonies. The Abseilung can look back on its activities this winter with satisfaction; the interest in colonial matters has been aroused to such an extent in just a few years that no lecture by explorers has taken place without an audience of around 1000 people. The branch of the German Colonial Society has probably undergone the most favorable development in this direction. Small announcements. - (The latest White Book.) The new "Reißbuch" on East Africa, which was sent to the Reichstag, contains five issues, ranging from April 27 to May 17. The first is a report by Captain Valetta from April 27 on the subjugation of Bwana=Heri. The second contains a report by Wißmann from April 28 on the complete calming of the north of East Africa and the situation of the individual stations. The third is a report by the same author on the slave trade in the German area of interest. He points out that if the necessary resources continue to be granted, the effective suppression of this trade is entirely possible. Number 4 reports the capture of Lindi. The last number (5) of May 17 reports the peaceful occupation of Mikindani. Wißzmann's report from Zanzibar, May 1, 1890, on the slave trade reads: "The fact that, although English slave surveillance ships had been stationed on the island for 10 years, the export nevertheless continued until the occupation of the coast by the gunfire troops proves how inadequate the surveillance of the coast by Imperial Navy vessels alone is to prevent the export of slaves. In Africa as a whole, the main transport of slaves took place on the route from Lamn in the north to the Zambezi in the south. North of the Somali coast, the export was much smaller, mainly because the Somali and Abyssinians themselves absorbed slaves coming from the interior. Dentsch land occupied most of the aforementioned coast and thus assumed the moral obligation to take action against the trade that was depopulating the inner African countries. The ratio of slaves brought from Africa to those bought in the coastal countries is already low today. Plantation cultivation, which is carried out by Arabs and Arabized coastal people, is at least equal in importance to that on Zanzibar and Pemba, so that the consumption of slaves, which has enabled the Arabs alone to build plantations up to the present day, is also corresponding. The coast is therefore the collection point for the export of certain slaves, and the coast itself consumes a large contingent. For these reasons, the most effective point for preventing the slave economy is obviously the coast itself. The successes that the Reichskommissariat has achieved in this direction to date are great. To best illustrate this, I mention the point that natives have handed over Arabs and coastal people who were particularly involved in the slave trade to me for punishment. Once we have come so far that the natives everywhere turn to us for protection and that we are strong enough to provide this protection, then no one will dare to capture and transport slaves. We can only succeed in suppressing the slave trade by making it impossible for them to be transported to the coast and traded. The slaves are hunted in the unfortunate regions where the natives can only defend themselves against the unhuman predators with spear and bow. In order to provide protection for the hunted natives in these countries, we would have to establish a connection to these vast areas through a series of stations. These countries lie almost exclusively within the borders of the Congo State, but the departure of the hunted slaves goes almost exclusively to German East Africa and is routed via a few very specific roads where the slave traders have established bases, such as Tabora and Ujidjl. Tabora is the most important junction of such roads. The slaves herded together in the north-west of Lake Biktoria, those coming from the interior of the Congo State (by far the largest number) and many of those hunted west of the Ryanzalee meet in Tabora on their way to the coast, and this place is therefore the most important for surveillance. The next most important point, Cinja, is situated on the three large lakes and by monitoring these, which is greatly facilitated here by a small armed steam vehicle, everything that can be done from Germany against this African plague would be done and, what is more, it would undoubtedly be crowned with success. So far I have only been able to establish one station and one observation post in the interior, the first is Mpuapua, the bottleneck through which the largest African slave caravan route passes and where I am also able to support my measures by force. The other at Kilimanjaro is for the time being only an observation post, as my means do not permit me to station a corresponding force there. For the reasons given at the beginning of this report and because I can weaken the slave hunters from the coast by monitoring the import of water and ammunition, the occupation of the coast is the most important step for the time being. The Arabs, as the party of the slave hunters can be described in one word, are already weakened by such measures. Their reputation for impregnability has been destroyed after the events on the German coast, and this is the best way to prepare a further advance against the interior and to initiate the suppression of this terrible band of people, which must lead to success if their natural progress is not interrupted by depriving them of the most necessary means. (German=East African Society.) The General Assembly of the German=East African Society has unanimously resolved to issue three million marks in preferential shares on the understanding that the existing shareholders will be entitled to subscribe. (The German colonies and the subsidized mail steamer line to East Africa). The latest report of the Chamber of Commerce in Frankfurt a. M. writes the following about German colonization in a remarkable manner: Anyone who linked the entry of the German Empire into colonial policy and the rapid acquisition of territories four times the size of Germany itself with the ideal idea that the new ventures would soon become self-sustaining and yield rich returns will, however, be disappointed with the current state of our protectorates. On the other hand, anyone who has taken the pessimistic view from the outset and rejected all colonial activity as an adventurous venture, even though all the seafaring European nations, however small and weak they may be in power and expansive strength, hold on to their colonial possessions - whether profitable or not - with the greatest tenacity and strive for further acquisition, who, despite England's almost boorish greed for acquisition, knows of no wiser advice, especially in those parts of the world in which Germany has established itself, than to give it all up again. than to give up everything again, i.e. to make England the master of all still free lands, may perhaps be a very good arditrageur, but he will not be very suitable as an advisor for capital investments. Colonies, for an empire like Germany, with such a large population, with such a powerful productive force, with such a fortunate disposition to educate lower-ranking peoples, for a nation that wants to and must continue its economic development independently of others, is a capital investment that will naturally provide little insight in the coming decades, but which must be entered into now, as long as there is still the opportunity to do so.

of acquisition and the ownerless land had passed into foreign hands. We have therefore taken possession of countries which, the further and more thoroughly they are explored, the more they confirm the conviction that large and powerful territories offer all the conditions for productive cultural work. Cameroon and Togo are already self-sustaining and their administration does not require any sacrifices for the empire. The large territory in South West Africa first requires a strong regiment to establish orderly conditions. Only then can the natural treasures of large areas be opened up, and if they are well organized, the immigration of Germans and the possibility for them to establish a carefree existence through cattle breeding and land cultivation is as little excluded as in Transvaal and Natal. East Africa, too, freed from the Arabs as slave hunters, offers a rich field for colonial work and will, if the peace and security of the owner are ensured, if traffic routes are created and the inhabitants are gradually educated to become hard-working people, yield returns that are still very underestimated today. All this, however, cannot be achieved by the Denish merchants alone; the empire must intervene with a strong hand, and must set a purposeful and energetic example, as it has done in recent times. England and France. Holland and the Hispanic peninsula, and more recently Russia and Italy, have gained their foreign possessions through their war power. It is the duty of civilized peoples to carry their culture out into areas where, under the rule of the best barbarians, otherwise well-disposed tribes are exterminating each other through constant fighting; it is the duty of civilized states to put an end to the theft of human beings, as it now exists for the needs of slaves, and to establish bodily and spiritual freedom even where, under the most brutal despotism, the life of the individual has no value and cannot develop a humane existence.... - (From the Togo area) the "Mitteilungen aus den deutschen Schußgebieten" reports: Lieutenant Herold arrived in Klein=Popo on April 6 and was about to set up a new station from Lome near Agome Palime, so that there were now two stations in that area of Reichswegen. The terrain for the station, which was given the name "Misahöhe", had already been chosen. The mechanic accompanying him, Stöhr, left for the Bismarckburg station on April 2 with a train of 24 men; after the departure of First Lieutenant Kling, the latter was administered by the technician Bugslag until the arrival of Dr. R. Büttner. In addition to the planter Goldberg, the latter also took along the farmer Paul Ohloff from Hamburg. The planter Goldberg, who had previously been active in Samoa for a long time, was sent there by the Reich to investigate this area, like Cameroon later on, for the cultivation of tropical products, especially cotton. Agome Palime, where the new Dent station is to be located, is close to the western border of the Togo area towards the English possessions in Ewelande, on the road to Kpandu and Salaga setwa at 6 degrees 55" north latitude and 0 degrees 35' east longitude). - The customs revenue in Togo in the budget year 1889,90 amounted to 91 270 marks. (Cameroon.) Premierleutnant Morgen, who had gone down the Sannaga River from the Jaundo station via Ngila's residence and had thus broken through the ring of intermediate traders, made some interesting discoveries, which are summarized as follows in the "Mitteilungen aus den deutschen Schutzgebieten": a) In geographical terms: 1. Discovery of the Mdam River; 2. determination that the Lungast is not an estuary of the united Sannaga and Mdam Rivers; 3. confirmation of the non-navigability of the said river as far as it has marched along it, namely from 10° 10' east L. to the Idia Falls. At the point of passage of the Exxedition, the Mham was definitely navigable even for larger vessels; 4. determination of the south-western boundary of the mudamedan Sudan=regents. b) In commercial terms: determination that trade in the hinterland east of Cameroon, especially from the right bank of the Mdam River, does not go to Cameroon, but via this river and the Sannaga over to the Bakoko and from there to Malimba and Batanga. The Bakoko, who live between the Sannaga and the Njong rivers, are the main trading tribe of southern Cameroon. Furthermore, there can be no doubt that the explored land is of great importance for the trade of Cameroon, especially with regard to the egg bone. - The Roard of Poreign Missione of tho Presbyterian Cburch, which had established itself in the French Gabon and the Spanish Coriseobai, had simultaneously begun the evangelization of Batanga when the German protectorate over Cameroon was declared. The German government, with whom the Board entered into negotiations, showed itself inclined to make far-reaching concessions to the mission, which, when it was granted the use of the English language in its missionary activities, chose Batanga as its station, where native missionaries had already been active in the past. Last year, a station was established there and the Reverend Brier was transferred there, who immediately began his work in this rich country, where there are villages of 500-1000 inhabitants - such as are only found among the developed and advanced Fan peoples. In his reports he was so enthusiastic about the future development of this area that the American Board decided to send the Reverend Georg Albert Godduhn, a German by birth but educated in America, to join him. As we have received a letter from America, he will be leaving for Great Batanga in August of this year, so that we can hope that the Americans will take an active part in the missionary work in our protectorate, especially if they succeed in selling their settlements in French Gabon to French missionaries at a reasonable price. - Captain (ret.) Emil v. Hartmann from Berlin has been commissioned by the House of Woermann to lead commercial expeditions to the interior of Cameroon and to establish regulated trade between the hinterland and the coast. - The customs revenue in Cameroon amounted to 200,526 marks in the 1890/91 budget year. (The dispute between England and Portugal.) On June 12, Under-Secretary of State Fergusson declared in the House of Commons that Portugal had accepted in principle the joint proposal of England and the United States to submit the question of the Delago Railway to arbitration. Missionary Krämer) of the Protestant Missionary Society for German East Africa has received permission to go to Tanga and wanted to move there as early as May 1. Greek traders have also settled in Tanga, which is charismatic, and seem to be able to withstand the competition from the Indians. (The imperial consul, Dr. Goering.) charged with the provisional performance of the functions of the imperial commissioner for the Judwest African protectorate has embarked on a journey to the southern part of the Namaqua country and intends to visit the Stolzenberg settlement in July of this year. The latest issue of "Nachrichten über Kaiser=Wilhelmsland und den Bismarckarchipel" (News about Kaiser=Wilhelmsland and the Bismarck Archipelago) contains interesting compilations on the health conditions in Kalser=Wilhelmsland. The most extensive are the reports on the state of health of the officers and workers at the main station in Finschhafen for the year 1889. On average, 54 employees of the company were present in Finschafen. From January 1 to March 31, 1889, the malaria= or climatic fever affected 93 white patients and required 569 days of treatment. -On average, there were 31 malaria patients with 189 sick days per month. Twice within a month, 27 people fell ill during the reporting period, three times 7 people. The percentage of malaria sick days among the company's employees fluctuated between 5.5 percent (beginning of January) and 15.7 percent (mid-January) over the three months; the average is 11.6 percent. In the six-month period from April 1 to September 30, 117 whites were treated with 444 days of climatic fever. There is a significant increase in the fever curve towards the end of May. End of July. The end of August and the end of September; thus, with a certain regularity, the fever rises at the end of the month. Only the month of June is an exception; here the height remains fairly constant towards the end of the month. A period of dysentery falls during this time; suspicious diarrhea was treated on 7 days and cases of dysentery occurred on 3 days. In the month of June, therefore, dysentery occurs vicariously for malaria. The increase in fever at the end of each month coincides with the time of the new moon. It is also noticeable that the peaks of the fever periods coincide with periods of heavy rainfall, such as at the end of May, the end of July and the end of August. In the quarter from October 1 to December 31, 1889, white employees of the company suffered an average of 17 febrile illnesses with 86 sick days per month. The percentage of illnesses fluctuated between 12.6 and 2.5 percent and averaged 6.5 percent During the rest of the year, the figures fluctuated between 4.0 percent. (beginning of September) and 28 percent (beginning of April). It should also be mentioned that the first illness of the new arrivals is often characterized by a rather severe, unusually long-lasting attack and slow recovery compared to later illnesses. (The Brussels Anti-Slavery Conference) seems to be at the end of its work. The last motion, put forward by the representative of the United States, called for the prohibition of the importation of adulterated spirits into Africa. However, it did not get through, but will only be included in the protocol as a wish. (The Congo State,) this creation of the high-minded King Leopold, is known to be in a crisis as a result of the sovereign's inability to meet the ever-increasing demands on his treasury to the same extent as before. After the state's attempts to start up had met with little success, there was no other option if the company was not to be abandoned or perhaps sold to France, which had long been waiting with lustful eyes, than for Belgium to take over the young state cum benoficio inventarii. In order to make this still hard morsel easier to digest for the time being, the motion was provisionally adopted at the Brussels Anti-Slavery Conference that the Congo State should have the right. to levy import duties of 10 percent ad valorem. The burdens that Belgium must impose on itself, despite this revenue, can be seen from a summary of its expenditure, which cannot well be reduced. The administration of the state, although it is still quite incomplete, already costs over 3 million a year, to which another million will be added if the resolutions of the anti-slavery conference are to be implemented by the Congo State. These expenses have so far been offset by only a few hundred thousand francs in revenue. The new customs duties will probably only yield a few hundred thousand francs in revenue in the next few years, and as the administration will inevitably develop more than trade, the deficit will still be considerable for many years to come If Belgium takes over the Congo State, as is to be expected, it will know exactly where it stands. It will, however, be impossible for it to leave its sovereign in the lurch, especially as a lively trade must blossom in the upper Congo with its strong population when the railroad from Matadi to Stanleypool is completed. The greatest hopes are now pinned on this railroad, and the Brussels syndicate has recently even succeeded in selling 20000 shares to a French bank. Initially, the French capitalists were not particularly interested in the issue for easily explainable political reasons, but now they feel compelled to take such a step, which can be exposed to all the less misinterpretation as the greater number of Congo shares are held in Germany, England, America and Belgium - (Das Weitzbuch uber Samoa) which was sent to the Reichstag.

This report contains the negotiations on the Samoa Conference, the resolutions of the same, the execution of the General Act by the reinstatement of King Malictoa, a consular decree concerning the sale of spirits to natives, the import and sale of weapons, as well as the consent of the Samoan government to the General Act of April 19, 1890. Prince Bismarck opened the negotiations on the conference by a dispatch of January 12, 1889 to Count Hatfeld with the proposal. Salisbury, together with Germany, should renew the American government's agreement to continue the negotiations of 1887 on a settlement of the conflict on the Samca Islands. Bismarck added that it was not his intention to win the islands for Germany or to call into question the agreement of the three powers with regard to their equal rights. On this basis, State Secretary Bayard accepted the invitation to the Berlin conference on February 5. This is followed by a decree from the Imperial Chancellor to the envoy in Washington inviting the government of the United States to take part in the conference, by reports from Hatfeldt and Arco in which the agreement of England and the United States is communicated, by the General Act of the Samoa Conference, by a decree to the Consul General in Apia, and by the instruction concerning the implementation of the provisions issued in the General Act of the Samoa Conference. - (The monuments in Apia and Zanzibar.) In the course of this summer, monuments will be erected to the officers and crews of the German navy who fell, were injured or died in battle in Apia and Zanzibar, the funds for which have been raised by the officers of the imperial navy through collections. Both monuments are of the same shape and material and represent an obelisk of cartaric marble about 2 meters high, which is divided into an upper and a lower part by a strongly prosiled cornice about halfway up. The upper part shows the naval eagle with anchor and a laurel wreath together with a dedication in relief on the front; the lower part bears the names of the remaining officers and men in chiseled lettering. - (The second issue of "Mitteilungen aus den deutschen Schutzgebieten") has a very rich content. In a lengthy article, Dr. W. Trabert examines the daily course of air pressure and air temperature at some stations of the German protectorates in equatorial Africa and New Guinea. Rain measurements from Abetisi in the Togo region are reported by missionary F. Ramseper. Unfortunately, the reports from Cameroon are again introduced by a necrology for Captain Karl Zeuner, Zintgraff's companion, who died in Lagos on April 23 this year. We hope to be able to return in more detail to interesting reports, accompanied by maps, on the expedition of Lieutenant Tappenbeck, who unfortunately died so young, and of Premier Lieutenant Morgen, who is currently active in the Cameroon hinterland. A third map and report provides the results of a survey carried out by S. M. Krenzer "Habicht" of the coastal area formerly known as Rio del Rey between Old Calabar and the Cameroon Mountains. Furthermore, the meteorological observations made by Dr. Zintgraff during his two stays at the Palistation are reported, the first such material from those previously unexplored parts of Africa. Secretary Eggert published a map of the small island of Nauru (Pleasant Island) from the Marshall Islands protectorate ("Chemical analysis of East African Hirsedier or Pombe.") In the laboratory of the Versuchs= und Lehranstalt für Brauerei in Berlin, a sample of "Pombe", the Hirjedier produced by various Negro tribes in East Africa, which had been sent to Germany by Major Wißmann, was chemically examined. Dr. O. Saare reports the results of the analysis in No. 24 of the "Wochenschrift für Brauerel"; the article concludes with the words: "According to this, the composition of the Hiriebier is similar to that of the single beers of our brewers. When more will be known about the present method of making millet beer, it will also be possible to indicate ways and means of making it a durable, palatable drink for our white and black rüder in Africa. (The caravou trade in Tripoli) leads a miserable existence, as a report in the June issue of the Handels=Archiv informs us. The days of the trans-Sabara trade are probably numbered, for the time seems not too distant when the Sudanese empires will be able to supply themselves in a more prosperous way on the waterways of the Niger and Benue with the ores of the civilized world, which they obtained from the countries of the African northern rim on their way through the desert. Great efforts are now being made in France to reorganize the colonial council. There is the Consoil aupérieur des colonies, which underwent a thorough reorganization by decree of 29 May this year. The Under-Secretary of State had initially intended to reconstruct this Council along the lines of the Council of State and to create various sections for dealing with finance, legislation, customs, etc. Customs and so on. However, he met with considerable resistance to this project, so that a different arrangement, grouping the colonies according to their affiliations, became popular for the sections. The first section comprises Martinique, Réunion and the American possessions, the second the West African, the third the West Indies and the Oftaniat, the fourth the oceanic colonial territory of France. The Conseil is made up of the parliamentary representatives of the colonies and representatives elected by the Kelons for three years. In addition, there are the representatives of the various administrations, chambers of commerce, etc. and scientific societies, such as the Bandelsgeographische Gelellschaft of Paris. In addition to these representatives, numbering 51, an indeterminate number of persons should be added who have a special knowledge of colonial conditions and have been active in the colonies.

We remind you once again that this year's General Meeting of the German Conial Society, the agenda of which has already been announced several times, will take place in Cologne a. Rh. on June 30 and July 1. The return of Wißmann. Early on Monday, June 23, the Reichskommissar Major Wißmann arrived in Berlin, accompanied by the German-friendly, respected Arab Soliman bin Nasr. We welcome him warmly in the joyful and grateful feeling that he has proved himself to be the right man in the right place in a serious colonial crisis. The first German to cross Africa, who achieved great things as a scout and geographer under the most difficult conditions and with few resources, grew with his goals and earned lasting fame both as a military man and as an organizer. When Captain Wißmann landed in Zanzibar on March 31st of last year, the whole coast was in flames, and only Bagamoyo and Dar=es=Salaam were still held by the Germans. Buschiri mocked the German power, the natives were intimidated by the Arabs, the Sultan's attitude was ambiguous, the blockade had only been successful in the immediate vicinity of the coast. All this changed, one might say in one fell swoop, when Wißmann won the first decisive victory over Buschiri on May 8th. Although Buschiri's incitement of the Masiti still made for difficult days for the Schutztruppe, his power was broken and a well-deserved end awaited him. We then saw Wißmann make the bold move to Mpuapua and see the German flag flying again on the outermost borders of the protectorate. We followed with joyful hearts his further victorious course, which led him to the north and finally to the south, until he was finally able to regard his task of suppressing the slave trade and protecting the German interests in East Africa as completely accomplished with justifiable pride. Loved by his subordinates, revered by the liberated natives, respected by the Arabs, whom, as the case of Bana Heri shows, he was also able to treat with his diplomatic skill, a man of whom one can boast that he made no enemy except the vanquished, he set foot on German soil again for a well-deserved rest. May the peace that he and his valiant Schutztruppe have achieved in this part of our possessions in Africa prove to be well-founded and lasting, and may Wißmann continue to stand by the colonial cultural work, whose blessings will only be fully recognized by later generations, as a loyal advisor and energetic promoter with the same success as bioher!
Dr. Karl Peters in Aganda. The last written communication that the German Emin Pasha Committee received from Dr. Peters was the report from Kapté=Kamassia dated January 16, 1290, printed in our No. 10, p. 127. A few days ago, the Executive Committee of the Emin Pasha Committee received further letters from Dr. Peters, dating back to April 15. The expedition had then continued its march to the Victoria Nyanza and was in Wachore's residence at Akola - only 5 to 6 days' journey from the area of Emin Pasha's former eastern stations - when Dr. Peters learned that Emin Pasha had left the Aquatorial Province and had departed with Stanley to the south. A further march in the direction of Wadelai would then have been pointless, especially as Peters, who only had 11 Askaris and 44 porters with him, could not think of waging war against the Mahdists. He therefore turned southwest to go to Uganda and come to the aid of the Christians under King Mwanga, who were in a difficult situation there. The march went through Usoga, a rich hilly country with an intensive culture that had been little explored until then. Near Ukassa, Peters slept at the same camp site where Bishop Hannington was murdered. A number of skulls and bones still bore witness to the catastrophe. At Ripon Falls on February 19, the crossing of the Nile and the advance through Uganda took place, which was hopelessly devastated. The march went on for days through completely burnt-out country. On February 25, the expedition arrived in Mengo-Rubagha, where King Mwanga and the whites had returned from their island of Bulingogwe. Here Peters did his best to help settle the situation in a European-Christian way. With the support of the superior of the French mission, P. Lourdel, he succeeded in concluding a treaty with King Mwanga on February 28, whereby the latter opened his country to the trade and traffic of all European nations, accepting the relevant provisions of the Congo Act, and at the same time entered into a special relationship of friendship with Germany. Despite the objections of English agents who intended to monopolize trade in Uganda for the British East African Company, the King stood firm by the treaty. The English help that Mr. Jackson was supposed to bring had failed to materialize! On March 16, King Mwanga issued a solemn ban on the trade in slaves and the importation of slaves. In order to support the king in his philanthropic endeavors and to make it possible for him to resist the Arabs who lived from slave raiding and slave trading, Peters gave him a large part of his gunpowder supply and, at the king's request, undertook to break the Arab influence in the west of Victoria=Nyanza, namely to remove the Arab Kimbulu from Busiba, who was responsible for the traffic and gunpowder supply from Unyanyembe to Unjoro. Peters sailed west around the lake in 30 boats with several hundred soldiers provided by the king. Kimbulu and Sultan Utatembora, who was loyal to the Arabs, in

Page 166

Busiba fled when the expedition approached, the country submitted to the Christian Mwanga and agreed to pay permanent tribute. In accordance with the king's wishes, Peters remained in Uganda for a month. During this time, the inhabitants streamed back into the devastated country en masse. Thus the German Emin Pasha expedition, even though it had lost its next destination due to Emin's withdrawal from the Aquatorial Province, contributed mightily to the promotion of the high task to which Emin had dedicated his life. Dr. Peters has earned unquestionable merit through his bold move, accomplished with admirable perseverance. The German Emin Pasha expedition will forever occupy a glorious position not only in the history of African exploration, but also in the history of the struggle against the Arab barbarism of man-stealing and human trafficking. From Uganda, Dr. Peters turned to the Usukuma region south of Victoria=Nyanza. His last reports are dated from the French mission Nyagezi near Ukumbi in Usukuma. From there he wanted to travel on to the coast via Ugogo. In the meantime he will have met Emin, who is returning to the interior, and we hope that the two German men have already joined forces to continue the great work on which they have been working hand in hand - the development of Africa for culture! The Anglo-German Treaty. The Anglo-German treaty, which we reported in the previous issue of the Reichsanzeiger, has, as was to be expected, received a very mixed reception due to some surprising provisions. After the informed press had already indicated that far-reaching demands of the colonial friends could not have been satisfied, that concessions were to be expected on both sides in the interests of world peace and friendship between Germany and England, it had been anticipated in colonial circles that Germany would have to give up some of its claims. However, the treaty came as a great surprise, as it was not limited to Africa, but brought to a head an issue that our strengthened national consciousness demanded to be resolved more and more urgently in the interests of Germany. The cession of the island of Heligoland overshadowed everything else for the time being, and, whatever one may think of the military value of the island, we too, who are primarily engaged in national politics, are pleased that this old German island has come back into our possession. It is only with the reattachment of this detached member of our tribe that the North Sea will in reality become a German sea and Germany will be completely master in its own house. The outward sign of British rule on the German seas thus disappears from Germany's face, and our maritime position also gains external closure. This point of view was also decisive for the press of almost all parties, which praised the acquisition of Heligoland with rare unanimity. A second consideration, which was a determining factor, here and there even decisive for the assessment of the treaty, appeared to be the final settlement with England, which had become necessary in the interests of the general political situation. Without a precise insight into the political circumstances, it is not possible to judge how far higher politics may have been decisive for the treatment of colonial questions, although an unbiased assessor cannot exclude the conviction that England, which has recently come into difficult colonial conflicts with America as well as with France and Portugal and is in constant danger of such conflicts with Russia, must perhaps be even more interested in a mutually good relationship than Germany. But although we recognize and appreciate the important points in favour of the treaty with complete clarity, we cannot conceal the fact that we and many colonial friends are severely disappointed. Before we go into the treaty in more detail and discuss the positions individually, we will summarize the basic material once again for better comparison. The announcement of the Reichoanzeiger reads: 1. the German sphere of interest in East Africa is limited a) in the south: by a line that runs from the mouth of the Rokura) in the vastness of Lake Nrassa to the mouth of the Kilambo in the south of Lake Tanganyika b) in the north: by a line that runs along the 1st degree south latitude from the west bank of the Victoria=Nyanza to the Congo State and bypasses the mountain 1) The Rikurn of other maps.
Mfumbiro to the south. Between Lake Nyassa and the Congo State, between Lake Nyassa and Lake Tanganyika, on Lake Tanganvika and between the latter and the northern border of the spheres of interest of both nations, traffic for the subjects and the goods of both nations will remain free of all duties. In the mutual spheres of interest, the missions of both states shall be granted freedom of worship and education. The subjects of the one state shall enjoy in the sphere of interest of the other the same rights of settlement and trade as the subjects of the state to which the sphere of interest belongs. England will use all her influence to persuade the Sultan of Zanzibar to cede to Germany the stretch of coast leased by him to the German East African Company. In this case, Germany will grant the Sultan a favorable compensation for the customs revenue he has lost. (2) The boundary between the German and British spheres of interest in South-West Africa shall run eastward from the point agreed upon in the earlier agreement along the 22nd degree of longitude to the 21st degree of longitude, thence northward along that degree to the point where it intersects the 18th degree of longitude, and thence eastward along the Chobi River to its confluence with the Zambesi. 3) The border between the German Togo territory and the English Gold Coast colony is to be formed, in accordance with the German proposal, by a line cutting through the disputed landscape of Crepi in such a way that the northern part with Kpandu falls to Germany, the southern part with Pekt to England. (4) Germany transfers to England her patronage over Witn and Semaliland in the north of the English sphere of interest. (5) Germany consents to England assuming the protectorate over the Sultanate of Sansidar, with the exception of the coastal strip leased to the German East African Company. 6. subject to the authorization of Parliament, England cedes the island of Heligoland to His Majesty the German Emperor. A period of time is agreed for the introduction of general conscription and German customs legislation in Heligoland, and the current inhabitants are to be granted the right to opt for English nationality for a certain period of time. 7. the other points of difference relating to colonial questions: Complaints about the landing of the steamer "Nrera", the demarcation of the Walsischbal, complaints against the English Niger Company, etc., having been established that there are no serious differences of opinion on these points in principle, are reserved for further amicable agreement Until the formal conclusion of the present agreement, which is to be effected within a short time by an exchange of notes, no undertaking in Africa which is in conflict with the above agreements will be sanctioned by either Government. The English Parliament was informed of this agreement by a despatch from Lord Saliobury to Sir E. Malet in Berlin, which reads as follows in literal translation: "The correspondence between Her Majesty's Government and that of Germany has now reached a point which allows me to request Sir Vercy Anderson to return to Berlin to discuss the necessary individual contributions with Dr. Krauel. The negotiations which he has had during his former residence in Berlin, as well as the discussions which we have had with the German Ambassador since his return, have enabled the two Governments to draw up with sufficient completeness the outlines of an agreement for the arrangement of the matters in dispute. The claims of the German Government are mainly based on the assertion that where one power occupies the coasts, another may not occupy the hinterland without its consent. It would be going too far to say that this assertion is entirely without foundation in customary international law. However, its effectiveness cannot be unlimited, while the limits within which this assertion is valid are difficult to draw. The original contention of the German Government, if I have understood it correctly, is that the whole territory between its sphere of influence and the Congo State belongs by nature to Germany as the "hinterland" of its own possessions. This would bring the German border along the first degree of latitude in the north and the degree of latitude in the south to the border of the Congo State. As far as the southern part of this claim was concerned, Her Majesty's government had a sufficient answer. The country was already occupied by the English. There were English missions and stations of the African Maritime Company at Lake Nyassa and Lake Tanganvika and along the Stevenson Strait connecting the two, and the rights acquired by these settlements could not be set aside by the vaguer claim which arose from the fact that these regions lie in the same latitude as the German territory situated more to the east. But as for the territory north of the Tanganvila, Her Majesty's Government had no answer. There were no English settlements, commercial or religious, between latitude 1 degree south and Lake Tanganvika. Mr. Stanley's treaties, according to the map supplied to us by Sir William Mackinnon, extended only to the 1st degree of south latitude, or 20 or 30 miles beyond it. Her Majesty's Government, therefore, had no legal title which could overthrow the claim of the German Government, based on the fact that this region lies immediately inferior to that of Germany. The pretension of the Germans was further supported by the fact that it would have the practical effect of

Page 167

User of the Vikteria Ryanza Sers into two roughly equal parts between the two governments. On the basis of these considerations, Her Majesty's Government have agreed to an arrangement whereby the line of the Stevenson Strait shall be the boundary between the English and German spheres of influence to the south. England will therefore retain the Stevenson Strait, as well as her claim to the whole area between the Strait, Lake Nyassa and the Congo State, which lies north of the 11th parallel. South of this latitude the questions that arise do not involve Germany. North of Lake Tanganyika, Germany retains the area north of the Kengo State up to 1 parallel degree south latitude. However, in order to make the boundary coincide as far as possible with the area secured by Mr. Stanley's treaties, the line will turn to the south so that Mount Mfumbiro will be included in the British sphere. In view, however, of the fact that the agreement reached between the two Powers will not in future prejudice trade from east to west or from north to south, it is agreed that German subjects and German goods shall have entirely free passage between the Ryassa and the Congo State, and shall pay no transit duties. English travelers and goods are to enjoy the same freedom and immunity between the northern end of Lake Tanganpila and the British sphere of influence. It is further agreed between the two Powers that in all East African territories subject to their influence the subjects of both Powers shall have equal rights of settlement and trade. The boundary between Ngamiland and Damaraland has not yet been finally drawn, and the details must be left to negotiations between Sir Percy Anderson and Dr. Krauel. It is agreed, however, that in the latitude of Lake Ngami and up to the 18th degree of south latitude the German boundary shall coincide with the 21st degree of east longitude of Greenwich. The nature of this country is very incompletely known and even the location of Lake Ngami is quite uncertain. There is little doubt, however, that the 21st degree of longitude will cover it and place Moremi's land in the Third Protectorate. In Togoland, where there has been some discussion as to the exact nature of the boundary fixed by the recent agreement between the two Powers, the arrangement is that a line will be drawn whereby the mouth of the Volta River will fall to England, but Germany will have access to the river at a higher point in its course. On the east coast, the German government has agreed to give up all territory it owns or claims north of the British sphere of influence. This will bring under British control the Sultanate of Witn, together with the Manda and Paita Yasels and the area up to Jud, over which the German Government has recently assumed the protectorate, a coastline of about 200 miles. The effect of this arrangement will be that, with the exception of the Congo State, there will be no European competitor for German influence between latitude 1° south and the frontier of Ugppten along all the country lying to the south and west of the Italian Protectorate in Abessynia and Gallaland. England will also, with the permission of the Sultan of Zanzibar (which has already been obtained), assume the exclusive protectorate over the Sultanate, including the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba. This is done with the full consent of Germany. The direct control and extended influence which this arrangement will give to Great Britain will powerfully assist the efforts to suppress the slave trade and to exterminate the slaves themselves. England will assist Germany in obtaining from Sullan of Sanstbar the recognition of the occupation of the present German coast line in return for the payment of a cheap indemnity for the customs duties imposed by him. On the other hand, Her Majesty's Government is prepared to submit to Parliament a Bill for the cession of Heligoland to Germany. The island was retained by that country in 1816, probably because of its proximity to Hanover, whose crown was then united with that of England. It has, however, never been treated by the British Government as possessing any desensive or military value, nor has any attempt or proposal been made to arm it as a fortress. Her Majesty's Government are of opinion that it would form a serious addition to the responsibilities of our Empire in time of war, without contributing to its security. There is therefore no reason for refusing to make it part of a territorial arrangement, if the motives for doing so are sufficient. It appears to Her Majesty's Government that the extension of British influence and territory on the eastern coast of Africa, which will be the result of the arrangements which I have declared to Your Excellency, will be a sufficient inducement to the Government of this country to allow the islands in question to be united with the German Empire. Conditions will be made which will secure all the present inhabitants of the islands against compulsory naval and military service, and also provide for the continuance of the present customs tariff for a period of twenty years. Several matters of detail remain to be arranged in accordance with the above outline and will form the subject of the final conferences between Sir Percy Anderson and Dr. Krauel, I remain in Salisbury. A comparison of the two texts with regard to the points concerning free intercourse shows that, according to the English text, the exemption of the subjects and goods of both sides does not extend to all duties, but only to all transit duties. But it seems far more important that, according to the English text, this exemption for German subjects and goods does not extend to the northern boundary of the mutual spheres of interest, but only to Nyassaland, whereas it applies to Euglian subjects and goods from the northern end of Lake Tanganyika to the southern boundary of the northern British sphere of interest, i.e. to the first degree of southern latitude. According to this, the interpretation would fall to the ground that those privileges for German subjects and estates are also effective beyond the first degree of southern latitude, through the northern English sphere of interest to its as yet undetermined northern border. The English text is clear and unambiguous, but the phrase "and the northern border of the mutual spheres of interest" in the German text and the expression "Abgaben" are likely to confuse understanding; the first phrase mentioned is unclear and the word "Abgaben" is more general than the "Durchgangszölle" in the English text. Fergusson has already informed the House of Commons that the publication of the German Reichsanzeiger is not correct and does not contain an exact reproduction of the Convention. It is also interesting, which was not mentioned in either text, that Fergusson serner stated that free British transit through Damara=land was the subject of the negotiations! Among the questions of a general nature is France's position on Zanzibar, which is based on an agreement of March 10, 1862, according to which "the Emperor of France and the Queen of England, recognizing the importance attached to the maintenance of the independence of the Sultan of Muscat on the one hand and the Sultan of Zanzibar on the other, have considered it good to mutually undertake to respect the independence of these two princes". Germany's agreement to this declaration was announced by Lord Lyons, then English ambassador in Paris, in a note to Freycinet dated November 27, 1886. According to the French papers, the main part of this note reads: "Germany undertakes to agree to the declaration signed by Great Britain and France on March 10, 1862, on the recognition of the independence of Zanzibar." Freyeinet replied to this note from Lord Lyons. "Paris, December 8, 1886, Mr. Ambassador! You informed me in your letter of November 27 of this year that Her Britannic Majesty's Government and the Imperial Government of Germany had reached an agreement on the delimitation of the Sultanate of Zanzibar, and you sent me a note which, on the one hand, indicated the points on which these two Powers recognized the sovereignty of the Sultan, and, on the other hand, confirmed the agreement of March 10, 1862, by which France and England recognized the independence of Zanzibar. The Government of the Republic has examined the proposal submitted to it, and I have the honor to announce that it has no objection to it. An interpellation has already been submitted to the French Parliament on the basis of these agreements and has been dealt with by the Minister of Foreign Affairs in a dilatory manner; it almost seems as if mutually satisfactory declarations concerning Zanzibar had been exchanged between the Cabinets of England and France before the conclusion of the treaty. If the reception of the treaty in Germany was very divided in wider circles, in England it was predominantly favourable, since the advantages offered to English trade and colonization in Africa could not justify a negative attitude towards the abandonment of the small German island, which was of no importance to England. Even the real English colonial chauvinists felt satisfied, and only very extreme politicians lamented the abandonment of Heligoland less out of inner conviction than out of political tactics. How could it be otherwise, after England had gained a dominant position in East Africa and its sphere of interest, which was further enlarged by Witu and southern Somaliland, then the protectorate over Zanzibar and secured the greatest possible advantages for its trade in the hinterland!) *) Stanley naturally has every reason to be satisfied. On June 19, he said in Neweastle: "The great dream of the English African explorers has been fulfilled, a great empire of 650,000 square miles has been acquired with the prospect of extending over a million square miles to Cairo. England now possessed a glorious table-land as far as the heart of Africa; it owned Kenya, the Mfumbiro and the Mountains of the Moon, as well as free transit traffic, which amounted to real ownership. In its own interests, Germany was now compelled to work together with England for free navigation on the Sambest. Regarding Heligoland and Sanstbar, Stanley said: "The Germans had laid their great, mighty days on Sanstdar, and now it bites that Zanzibar be placed under English rule and that Heligoland be ceded to Germany in return. I have never been to Heligoland, but I am sure that if the small island of Pemba were to be ceded to

After these general considerations, we move on to an appraisal of the individual regions, starting with East Africa as the most important. East Africa. The heaviest blow which our interests have suffered in East Africa lies without doubt in the surrender of Zanzibar to the British and the abandonment of Witu. After years of wrangling over supremacy in Zanzibar between Germany and England, it has now been decided in England's favor, despite the great advances made by Wissmann, through which the Germans had gained considerable influence there. There is no doubt that Arab influence extends from Zanzibar through the whole of East Africa, that all political threads converge there, and that in purely political terms it would have been of the utmost importance for us to gain influence through the Sultan of Zanzibar and the great Arabs throughout our entire area of interest. In view of the uncertainty of all political conditions, it is an unfortunate consolation that a power now friendly to us holds the reins there, apart from the fact that it is somewhat depressing to be dependent on the good offices of England for the possession of the coast, which de facto belongs to us. In Zanzibar, the Germans have old and solid trade connections, Hamburg houses have a lively trade with Germany, so knowledgeable people would pay ten times the price of Heligoland for Pemba alone. But you don't have Pemba alone, but Sanstbar with 250000 inhabitants. If you add this gift to the other gifts from Saltsbury, you will recognize the advantage of the agreement.
German commercial influence there has grown from year to year. Only a few months ago, in the explanatory memorandum to the bill concerning the steamship line to East Africa, reference was made to the great importance of Zanzibar for our trade; it was stated there that the turnover of goods of the German trading houses in East Africa, some of which have been established there for many years, is considerably greater than the direct exchange of goods between Germany and East Africa and is even superior to the English houses in Zanzibar. In view of the close and promising relations with Zanzibar in particular, the establishment of the German East Africa Line in Hamburg was greeted with great satisfaction, and now this most important hub of all East African trade, the key to the interior, is being left to England; for its protectorate there means its supremacy! In order to obtain the necessary clarity as to the commercial significance of this concession, it must be pointed out that the Sultan's dominion extends over the islands of Pemba, Zanzibar and Masia, apart from some small coastal places in the Somali region, such as Kismaju, Barawa, etc.; the northern Pemba is 964 □ km. the Zanzibar in the middle is 1590 □ km. and the southern Masia 527 □ km. According to the "Hamburger Börsenhalle", the three islands are all the more commercially important because, apart from their other diverse products, they are the main production sites in East Africa for spice nellies, the export of which, according to credible sources, has an average value of no less than about 250000 pounds sterling = 5 million marks per year. This amount is more than a fourth of the total export. Apart from ivory, Pemba and Sanstbar - not counting Masia - alone supply as many products as the entire aqua

Page 169

torial Africa; the island of Pemba alone can export an average of 70,000 sacks of cloves at 1½ cents per year. The English trade policy, which has established firm bases everywhere - one need only think of Hong Kong and Singapore and, more recently, Lamn - has once again celebrated a surprising triumph here. The German-African steamship company will face extremely lively competition from the British-Indian line; the Indian trading houses on Zanzibar will now make an effort to establish a good connection with Bombay; new efforts will be made by the English to draw the caravan trade to Mombas and from there to Zanzibar, in short, the development of the German coast, even if it may indirectly benefit from it, will nevertheless have an extremely difficult time. For today, the foundations for a commercial upswing have hardly been laid on the coast; almost everything is still lacking, while Zanzibar is already so far developed that we will remain dependent on the facilities and connections there for some time to come. Fortunately, steps have been taken to gradually move away from Zanzibar and the advantages that the ports on our coast offer us over the Zanzibar rhede are certainly not to be underestimated. But we do not find the present agreement sufficiently forward-looking and as a result it seems somewhat depressing, although we believe that ways and means will be found to prevent possible customs disputes or later customs battles, which cannot be ruled out if England wants to make traffic with its sphere of interest particularly favorable. The meaning of free trade in the hinterland of our sphere of interest is, as previously noted, not at all clear, and it will require a precise delimitation of this concept as well as of the zones, so that new difficulties do not arise here later. The reason why the British have secured freedom of movement in this area can only be fully understood if one remembers the efforts made by various parties to undermine the Congo Act; for according to Chapter! of the Congo Act, freedom of trade is completely free in the basin of the Congo into which the present frontier falls. According to Article II, all flags shall have free access to all the waters of the Congo, including the lakes, just as goods of any origin shall not be subject to any taxes other than those levied as cheap compensation for expenses incurred for the benefit of trade. Any unequal treatment of ships and goods is prohibited, and goods imported into these territories shall remain exempt from import and transit duties. According to the German-English agreement, on the other hand, we would not even be allowed to levy the duties permitted by the Congo Acts on English traffic between the Tanganyika Sea and the southern part of the English sphere of interest! The English have now achieved what has often been ridiculed as the dream of English colonial fanatics, but which we have always appreciated in all its seriousness: a partial political and partial commercial embrace of our East African protectorate, which is all the more dangerous as they will be able to exploit the advantages they have gained with incomparably greater means than we can. It is gratifying in itself that our political sphere of interest has been recognized as far as the Great Lakes, but that we, who had already gained a firm political foothold in Mpuapua in order to assert our well-founded claims, still had to accept Witu and Somaliland with the promising Jub river basin, is not quite understandable. Witu had, of course, lost importance in recent times as a result of the well-known events we have touched on several times, but it was all the less to be expected that it would be given up without sufficient compensation, as the relationship with the German-friendly Sultan had only recently been strengthened anew by the Consul General. Such compensation for Witu and Somaliland does not lie, in particular, in the way the spheres of interest between Victoria Nyanza and the Congo State were demarcated, since here the German claims had to give way to the English. It is quite strange that the Mfumbiroberg is still included in the English sphere of interest; Stanley only saw it from a great distance on his last journey, so that its exact location and extent could not be determined at all. We have drawn the border around the mountain on the map according to the wording of the German text, although the view seems to be held in England that the border line from the Mjumbiro no longer runs on the first degree, but further south, and that the closer determination of the same will have to be done according to river courses, which are very numerous on Stanley's new map, and the nature of the soil in general. The boundary here therefore remains a completely arbitrary one, whereas it would certainly have been more rational to move it more to the north and have it end at a geographically specific point. The extent to which geographers differ on the extension of the border to the west can also be seen from a statement by Prof. Dr. Kirchhoff, according to which the southwestern Nilland, i.e. Lake Albert Edward and its surroundings, should now fall within German colonial territory from the second degree of latitude, since the lake in question belongs to the Ril area but not to the Congo area. With regard to the demarcation in the southwest of the East African territory, the situation is not much better. The free zone to the west

 of Nyassa is of course only of importance to the English, as the Germans will certainly have no interests to represent there for a long time. The English were primarily interested in possessing the Stevenson Road, which they succeeded in doing, with one small exception, when a geometrically straight borderline was established. It is now important to note that the area which falls within our sphere, the northern tip of the Ryaisa up to the high plateau, especially the land of the Anyanyakyusa, is described by both Consul Johnston and the missionary Dr. Kerr Croß, who visited the same area last year, as very fertile and densely populated by a strong tribe. The high plateau north of the Nyassa is more fertile than the marshland, but less fertile; however, it is claimed that the tea bush and coffee tree will thrive excellently here. Consul Elton also describes this country as the most beautiful he has ever seen in Africa. Even Natal, the famous "Garden of South Africa", could not compete with it in terms of fertility or the opulence of the pastures. The English missions settled on these heights and created bases for the further development of the country, which is known to be occasionally troubled by Arab slave traders. If anything can to some extent reconcile us to the thought of our losses in East Africa - from a purely colonial political point of view - it is the positive advantage that we now possess a fairly well-defined unconquered territory which will not present any barriers to the spirit of enterprise for a long number of years to come, that the territory gained is still so large, that the territory gained will still be as large as not even the boldest dreams could have imagined 10 years ago, and that the secure possession, whose extent and sources of aid will gradually become known in detail, to which Emin's expedition should also contribute, will have a greater attraction for the capitalists than under the previous unclear constitutional arrangement. For with the cession of the coast to the German Empire, the development of constitutional law, which still lay darkly before us, will also have taken a huge step forward. Colonization on a large scale according to the English model requires above all English means and that enormous spirit of speculation which the Germans, who are accustomed to reckoning with perfectly clear conditions in their capital investments, lack because of their lesser wealth and their unfamiliarity with colonial matters. If the consequence of this agreement, in contrast to the thoroughly denying judgments of the colonial opponents, were to be a stronger influx of German enterprise into East Africa, a stronger straining of all forces, a rational and continued benevolent attitude of the imperial government towards the East African ventures now and in the future, we would, despite the English in Zanzibar and in the hinterland of our sphere of interest, still have to regard the future of our East African colony as a promising one. Southwest Africa. The agreements with England of December 2, 1885, as set out in the memorandum submitted to the Reichstag, and the treaty with Portugal of December 30, 1888, come into consideration for the delimitation of this territory. The extension of the German protectorate into the interior is - we follow in the theocetic 1) Thus Groß reports that on an expedition to Lake Rikwa he had found two old English cannons in a village which had been brought there by the Arabs. They were three feet long, loaded with pieces of iron and were used in the slave hunts against the native villages.
The German Colonial Society's petition to the Imperial Chancellor of April 5, 1890 - first of all established that (according to a communication from the English government) the borders of the Betschnanaland, which has been placed under its patronage, extend to the west to longitude 20 degrees east (Greenwich) and to the north to latitude 22 degrees south. In addition, the English government has undertaken to the German government not to extend its influence westwards beyond 20 degrees east longitude and not to oppose the development of the German protectorate up to this longitude. Finally, the said government also instructed the English officials of the Cape Colony to refrain from exerting any influence on the chiefs of Great Namaqua and Hereroland and to inform Chief Kamaherero and other neighboring rulers that England did not intend to extend its protectorate beyond the territory of Walsischbai. In the treaty between the German Empire and Portugal of December 30, 1886, Article 1 defines the boundary line which is to divide the German and Portuguese possessions in South-West Africa; it follows the course of the Kunene River from its mouth to the waterfalls which are formed south of Humbe at the breakthrough of the Kunene through the Serra Canna. From this point, the line runs parallel to the latitude as far as the Kubango, then along the course of this river as far as the town of Andara, which is left to the German sphere of interest, and from there in a straight easterly direction as far as the Catima rapids on the Sam River. December 1885, it immediately became apparent that it was neither sufficient nor favorable to German interests. At that time, England laid claim to Betschuanaland and designated the territorial boundary in the west as the 20th degree of longitude east of Greenwich and in the north as the 22nd degree of latitude. These borders were recognized by the German Empire. In reality, Betschuanaland is now bounded in the west and north by the Moloppo River, which flows from east to west approximately parallel to latitude 26° and continues its course southwards in a straight line at longitude 21° until it flows into the Orange River. England has therefore had its territory recognized far beyond the border of Betschnanaland; in fact, between the Moloppo and the 20th degree of longitude there are Nama whose landholdings have been cut through several times by the observed boundary. What England intended and achieved with the extension of its territory northwards to the 22nd parallel is openly stated in the notices of the Royal Geographical Society in London. At the instigation of the Cape Government, the 22nd parallel was chosen, along which the borderline was extended eastwards to the Portuguese territory in order to embrace the South African Republic in the north. The relevant passage (Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society, Vol. VII. 1885. p. 457) reads literally: The Cape authorities carry it (the nothern boundary 22° S. lat.) nearly as far as the 32nd degree, claiming the strip of land between the Limpopo river and that parallel, aud no shutting in the Transvaal on the north as it is on all other sides. Recently, the British-South African company had also laid claim to the entire territories north of the 22nd parallel up to the Cubango and Zambezi rivers on the basis of treaties with the chiefs Khama and Lobengula, and an English company had Raamiland in particular transferred to it by treaty from the ruler of Raamiland. In the

Page 171

The board of directors of the newly founded General African Exploring Company, which intended to exploit the concession granted by "King" Moremi, also included several members of the British African Company and it is due to their influence that Rgamiland, which was partly claimed by the red nation of Hoachanas under German protection, definitely came into English hands when the border was regulated. The agreements of 1885, however, leave it unclear whether England can extend its possessions northwards beyond the 22nd parallel; the English government had stated at that time that the borders of the Betschuanaland, which had been placed under its protection, extended in the west to the 20th degree east longitude and in the north to the 22nd degree south latitude; the English government only committed itself to the German government not to extend its influence westwards beyond the 20th degree east longitude. In fact, however, in the treaty with Portugal of December 30, 1886, more than a year after the aforementioned agreement with England, the German Empire had already defined the northern borderline of its sphere of interest as far as Catima on the Zambezi. This agreement would not appear justified if there were any doubt on the German side about continuing the German sphere of interest north of the 22nd parallel inland beyond the 20th meridian, in other words taking possession of the countries located south of the border line agreed with Portugal. The place Andara (21° 30" east of latitude, 17° 21* longitude) is already expressly described in this treaty as belonging to the German sphere of interest. The new demarcation, which makes us regret that the British were not forced to cede the Walsischbai to us in return for the concessions we made to them in the east, which was of almost no value to them, presents a geographically rather tricky picture, since the border line forms two paragraphs, which leave only a very narrow strip for the German extension to the Zambezi, although it is by no means certain that a more precise topographical survey will not reveal this, at least at the intersection of the 18th and 21st degrees. and 21st degree, will not make it even narrower than it already appears. Togoland. Between the imperial commissioner Falkenthal and the French governor Bayol, who were appointed boundary commissioners by their governments, the meridian has been fixed as the boundary line between the German and French territories on the Slave Coast, which, starting from the coast, meets the western tip of the small island called Bayol, situated in the lagoon between Agué and Klein Popo a little to the west of the village of Hillakandji, and has been extended until it meets the 9th degree of north latitude. These agreements, by which the eastern boundary of the protectorate with the French Nachdar is finally and for the time being sufficiently secured, have been approved by the two governments involved, with whom a demarcation of the mutual spheres of interest beyond the coastline (west of Lome) had not yet been agreed Unfortunately, the new demarcation means that the German colony is and remains excluded from the mouth of the Volia, but we have gained rights to the middle and upper reaches of the important river. They have in fact only retained the old boundary of their possessions on the Gold Coast, as shown on "Stanford's Map of the British l'ossessions in West-Africa", and added the small tip of the Toyeng River, if our sketch map is correct. Although this demarcation only corresponded to the trade and power relations in the hinterland, it is nevertheless pleasing. By Georg Baldan. (continued). The trade in the northern Cameroon region. - The unloyalty of Fallereien. - Plantations. The question of the Aederter. - The rogers' trade in English and Dutch colonies. - The commander's writs. If the commission trade were broken, the production of the colonies would multiply, for the negro, for whom time has no value, will gladly carry his oil and his palm kernels hundreds of miles if he only knows that he will be well paid for them. Here in our territory it would be relatively easy to prevent or suppress the emergence of this commission trade from the outset, at the same time as the introduction of a new order, but this requires a greater power than we have at present. The German government has made it its business with commendable zeal to eradicate this commission trade, which has been entrenched for centuries, and has succeeded in doing so in the areas along the rivers, which can be reached with gunboats and armed sloops, but in the land behind it nothing can be done at present. This requires a significant force of black troops and good roads. In our idea, 100 men of black soldiers would be sufficient to prevent all commission trade. The commander of these would be the ruler of the country, whose will would be law and against whom no one would be allowed to rebel. He would easily be able to persuade the people to turn the narrow paths between villages into wide and even roads and to maintain them. But what use would these roads be without draught animals and carts? In the whole country there is no other beast of burden than man, and for this the cow paths are sufficient. Under the present circumstances, the construction of large roads would not bring any corresponding benefit and would therefore only be an unnecessary burden for the people. Thus the country can never develop properly until it is amply provided with draught animals and roads, an object of the administration's desire. In New Year 1888, for the first time, white men carried merchandise up the Meme, when I, accompanied by Mr. G. Linnell, drove up to Ekumba=Lionga, where a factory was to be built next to the landing-place. On this occasion the village gave us a fat heifer as a present, which my people would have been ashamed to eat. When I returned, Mr. Linnell stayed here to supervise the construction of the factories and then to preside over them. A carpenter and three other men stayed behind with him as interpreters and supervisors. A few weeks later, Knutson went there with two boats and accompanied by Mr. E. Wattman, who was to preside over a factoring factory in Bonge, the construction of which had recently begun. However, nothing came of this, for Mr. Wattman fell ill on the way there, and after arriving there he contracted the so-called "black fever", which ended his life after a few days. This place, like so many others in Africa, had hardly been covered when he had to open a grave for a white man. This, however, cannot be blamed on the climate of this place, for Mr. Watiman carried the germ of the disease that put him to death. Due to the dense and high forest, which protects against the breeze from the sea, the river valley of the Meme is sedr warm, but not unhealthy. The best proof that the climate in the opposite wedge is actually very good is that both Mr. Linnell and Mr. E. Bovallius, who took over the factory in Bonge after Mr. Wattman, have enjoyed relatively good health. These two factories are of the same construction; on a wide enclosed square stands a two-storey vodnhaus about 9 meters long and 6 meters wide. Like the houses of the indigenous people, it is made of long poles and cross timbers and is covered both inside and out. On the lower floor there is a store and a storeroom, the upper floor is occupied by the headman and contains a bedroom.

Page 172

There is a room and a hall; on the river side there is a veranda with a pretty view over the river. The roof is covered with bamboo mats. In line with the dwelling house are a storehouse, also covered, and a spacious bamboo house, which serves as accommodation for the people of the factories and the boat crews when they come up there. The covered houses are painted with white kaik paint, so that from a distance they resemble nice, solid houses. Each factories is assigned two Krumänner and two indigenous boys, so-called "rountryhoys", who, apart from a few Bombeko= and Betiklajünglingen, currently belong mainly to the Balwiri people. The boat trips to and from the factories are, however, very arduous and detrimental to health; that is why Kuntson and I, despite being used to the climate and also to strenuous journeys, took turns accompanying the boats. In most cases, these journeys have had no bad consequences for us, whereas the other white men have almost always become more or less ill the few times they have accompanied the boats. The journey up to the factories takes at least 2, sometimes 21 days; the return journey takes 14 days. Depending on the time of year, one has to endure either a burning sun or incessant rain all day long in the narrow bays packed with all kinds of goods. The extremely humid nights are usually spent in the boat, which is anchored at Bamoso or Ndane. The endurance of the Krumans in rowing is admirable. On these trips, they row from sunrise to sunset, i.e. 12 hours, and during this time they only stop for half an hour to enjoy some colten rice and fish, which have been cooked before departure. If there is moonlight, the trip is usually continued for half the night. On these voyages the crew eats little, but drinks all the more, especially on hot days when often 5 liters of water are drunk per man. These people sweat as if they were just a large filter through which the water is strained. The sun bakes their shiny, sweat-soaked bodies, and often the refreshing breeze fails to appear, so that they find themselves as if in a steam bath; nevertheless, they continue with the strenuous rowing, evenly and rhythmically, without under-turning and with undiminished strength hour after hour, like automatons, or machines without feeling or ability to tire. However, this only applies when they are supervised by a white man; left to their own devices, they certainly do not work in this way. The rainy season and work elsewhere prevented us from visiting our newly acquired possessions for several months, but at the beginning of the dry season, in November and December, we undertook a few trial trading trips to Balundu. We got to know the waterways and the approximate extent of the trade and decided to set up small factories with blacks as stewards at the landing places. In the meantime, the Calabar men had returned during the rainy season and we met them in several villages, partly engaged in trade and partly in collecting old debts. They were now leaving again, but they had brought smallpox to Jlloani, which soon killed several Persians, including the village's most prominent chief, the owner of the two-storey house. However, the people had learned to fight the disease in the right way through old, trustworthy experience. The sick were immediately isolated by taking them to the small isolated houses in the plantations, and the surrounding villages were forbidden to have any contact with the infected village under strict penalty. The result of these wise orders was that the disease, which usually wreaks such havoc among the blacks, claimed only a few victims this time and was completely eradicated before the end of the dry season. The Calabar men continued to stay in Bamoso, where they exchanged stretched fish for rum, gin and other goods subject to customs duties, which they did not have the right to import. During one of our encounters with them, an episode took place which I would like to mention here because it bears witness to the cold-bloodedness of my friend Knutson in the face of imminent danger. One day, as Kuution was traveling through Bamoso, he heard that the Calabar men had left in the morning and had taken three graziers with them in exchange for a claim. When he arrived on the Ndame, he saw two large Calabar canoes, and to investigate whether the robbed men were in them, he immediately headed for them. The grazers were not found, but in one of the two canoes were two crates of gin, which the owner of the canoe was immediately ordered to deliver. The latter refused, and one of his slaves, belonging to a tribe known for its courage in the interior of the country, rose quickly and pointed the muzzle of his rifle at Knutson's chest, threatening to shoot him down if the crates were touched. The fellow was in a very agitated state, his eyes rolled wildly and the hand he held on the lock of the rifle trembled strongly, so that the rifle could be squeezed off at any glance, even if the fellow did not want it Knutson, meanwhile, remained calmly seated, but ordered the scimitars to immediately load the rifles they always took with them on such journeys. The crooks, who are quite courageous on the water, quickly shot cartridges into the rifles and pointed them at the slave and his master, whereupon one of us was ordered to fetch the gin crates. The Calabar man then wrapped his arms around the slave and threw him to the bottom of the canoe, showering him with accusations that his foolish behavior had caused himself, his master and all the others in the canoe to fall into the *) Wherever bamboo is mentioned, the rhizome palm is meant. The real bamboo is rare and is not used for building.
would have brought the greatest danger. The disputed ginkgo boxes were now taken into our boat, which then continued its journey. When Knutson returned to Bamoso a few days later, he found two of the stolen women there, who had been returned by the Cal=barmen, who had been frightened by the gin palaver. These journeys took so much time and the boats held so few goods that we could not sufficiently supply the new factories with goods, nor could we carry away all the products we had bought from them. We therefore bought two large canoes and manned them with countrymen. But even these two canoes proved to be inadequate, and goods were often spoiled by the rain in the open vehicles. It was therefore necessary to purchase larger, canopied and, above all, faster boats. During my visit to my home country in the summer of 1888, I therefore bought a small but powerful and fast-running bowser in Stockholm, to which a fully decked barge of 12 tons was built in Livervool. When I returned here in October of the same year, I had these two vessels with me, and this marked a new era in our trade. The Buasir steamer "Bibundi" cannot go any further up the Meme than Mongosi, but that is a great gain. It takes 7-9 hours to get there from Bibundl with the Pradm and two boats in tow. I have already mentioned the great fertility of the land and its suitability for plantation agriculture a few times, but I would like to say a few more words about it here. Only a few years ago, plantation cultivation was still new and untried in Africa, but since the Germans obtained colonies there, the plantation question has been embraced by them with great and ever-growing interest. In 1885, a large company was formed, the "Kamerun=Land= und Plantagen=Gesellschaft", whose share capital amounted to several million marks and which began to establish a cocoa plantation in the Bay of Warships between Viltoria and Bimbia in the east of the same year. At present there are about 150,000 young cocoa trees in this plantation, which are growing so luxuriantly that the company can certainly count on a good result from this first attempt. Extensive trials have also been carried out on this plantation with tobacco, several varieties of which have given a very good yield in terms of both quality and quantity. The cultivation of a very expensive Havana Valley with short, broad and yellowish-brown leaves has been particularly successful. In order to make use of the experience gained here, the company has now established a large tobacco plantation in Batanga, and the tobacco grown there has been of even better quality than the former. Another, smaller company has owned a tadak farm here in Bibundi for six months, and a third company started a cocoa plantation in Jonie in March of this year. The lively interest and good example set by the Germans should encourage the formation of a larger Swedish plantation company for mainly cocoa farming here in Cameroon. We have an abundance of suitable land both in the above-mentioned area at Meme and at the foot of the mountain in the vicinity of Vikoria. The greatest difficulty that stands in the way of the establishment of plantations is the lack of tangibles at a cheap price. This brings us to another issue - the question of laborers. As long as Cameroon has been in German hands, this question has been on the agenda. Much has been done to solve it, but no result has yet been achieved. It has often been said that the blacks are bad Ardites, but in my opinion this is not true. Those who have once become accustomed to a certain kind of ardite, under proper supervision, display incredible endurance, of which the rowing of the Krumans and other coastal peoples, as well as the ability of the blacks to cover long distances with heavy loads on bad roads, day in and day out, month after month, is an example. Crooked men can be found at all the factories along the west coast, and they are indispensable as capable and cheap workers for them, but they have the defect that they cannot be made to work in the fields. There are suitable workers for this in Lideria and on the Gold Coast, but they are expensive. It is from there that the German plantations have brought their present demand for agricultural laborers. (To be continued.) Announcement. German Colonial Society. Berlin Department. We hereby inform you that we have decided, in accordance with the general mood in colonial circles, to refrain from the planned and already initiated celebration in honor of the Reichskommissar Major Wißmann and the Schutztruppe. The reason for this decision is the completely changed situation in East Africa as a result of the Anglo-German agreement, which no longer gives cause for celebrations.

The latest reports of Dr. Peters. Nyagezi near Ukumbi in Usukuma, April 13, 1890. The Board of the German Colonial Society for the attention of His Serene Highness Prince Hohenlohe=Langendurg Berlin. Through the intermediary of the German Emin Pasha Committee, I have the honor of sending the Board of the German Colonial Society the following account of the progress and results of the German Emin Pasha Expedition that I led. I consider such a communication to the German Colonial Society to be appropriate because our enterprise has developed in close connection with the management of this society and has received constant encouragement and support from it during my initial stay in Germany. I can overlook the difficulties I encountered due to the situation of East African conditions in Zanzibar and on the coast. Instead of the large undertaking as planned, a small expedition had to take its place because it was absolutely impossible for me to obtain porters in Zanzibar. I did not have a single Zanzibar porter in my expedition; even my private servants, who had been loyal to me for years, gave way to the influences exerted by the Arabs to thwart the German enterprise in Central Africa. I did not have a single servant from Sansidar. I was able to procure a total of 70 men in Dar=es=Salaam and Bagamoyo with the permission of the German Reichskommissar, Captain Wißmann, and through the mediation of the Catholic mission. In Lamu and Witn I temporarily brought this number up to about one man. However, desertions very quickly reduced it to 60 Vagasi and this has remained the maximum number throughout. Today I have 43 porters. The British wanted to thwart my expedition in the worst possible way. Landing, even though I had planned to do so outside the Blolade area, was made difficult by British warships; my vessels were confiscated. English expeditions tried to obstruct my route. Such were the conditions for me when I set out on the Tanaroute. This route has its great difficulties; two English expeditions, that of Mr. Pigott and that of Mr. Smith, both extraordinarily better equipped than we were, succumbed to these difficulties. I suspect that Mr. Pigott's expedition was the one which Mr. de Winton had already predicted at Baringo in the early winter of 1833, and which I was to meet on its return from Emin Pasha, if I were still to be sent off. I had already met her returning tracks earlier, but unfortunately she had neither reached the Aquatorial Province nor the Baringo at all. She had already turned back before Umdvi, through which I passed at the beginning of November 1889, while I myself only arrived at the Baringo on January 6, 1890! So it was still a reasonable end to the Baringo. We met the third English expedition, at least in its headquarters, in Kavirondo. It was that of Mr. Jackson, who, as his letters to Uganda, which I was shown, said, had been staying there for months in "fear and trembling" on the threshold of the Nile region, but could not decide to march to Uganda with 500 men to protect Christian interests. Mr. Jackson's expedition had, if I am not mistaken, set out from Mombas in the autumn of 1888, so had a head start of 8--9 months over us. The course of our expedition will be described by me elsewhere. I would just like to explain to the board of the German Colonial Society why I believe that this undertaking, which was so lively supported by them, should not be considered as having been carried out in vain, despite Emin Pasha's departure. 1) The following are reports on the conduct of an English expedition leader who was still intriquing against Peters in the most hostile manner in March of this year. We will refrain from publication for the time being
First of all, I may state that I believe I carried out the expedition technically. I had reached Wakore in Akola, from where I still had 5-6 marches to Rilsee Kodja, from where, as Emin Pasha confirmed to me, there was direct contact with his former station Kodja and Foweira and thus with Magungo and Wadelai. But Emin was gone, as I learned in Wakore. I now had to consider how to make my expedition useful in the spirit of its organizers. The Emin Pasha enterprise had arisen in connection with the great anti-Arab and anti-slavery movement, of which Emin Pasha appeared to us as the pioneer in Central Africa. After his position had been taken, the second decision in this conflict was made in Uganda, where the Christian and Arab parties struggled with each other. If the German Emin Pasha expedition succeeded in intervening decisively here, we had not marched to Central Africa in vain. I therefore crossed the Nile in a south-westerly direction and marched into Uganda. The result of our invasion was that King Mwanga returned to the Mengo residence with the missionaries on the Nyanza island of Bulingogwe, and the written party formally established itself in power over Uganda. Kalema stayed away in Unjoro. It was my privilege to intervene in the regulation of the new situation and to observe the rapid blossoming of the country in its beginnings. It was astonishing to see the speed with which the tasteful little houses grew up and the wide roads were rebuilt. At the king's request, I stayed in Uganda for a month and during this time the inhabitants streamed back into the devastated country en masse. With the support of Monsigneur Lourdel, Superior of the Catholic Mission in Uganda, I succeeded in persuading Mwanga to accept the Congo Act and to undertake by treaty to open his country permanently to whites without distinction of nationality, and also to prohibit the trade and export of slaves by a solemn act of March 16 of this year. By these two acts we may regard Uganda as having entered the Enropean system, and thus the surest bar was set against the Arabization of these territories by peaceful means. For what is the Arab doing where there is no black elf? At the same time, I had my Somalis drill the Waganda, and although my expedition had been sufficiently weakened on the coast, I was still able to hand over 150 pounds of powder to the Christians of Uganda, a very valuable donation in this powder-depleted area! The king himself received 120 pounds of it. In connection with these efforts, I took on the task of breaking the Arab influence in the west of the Victoria Ryanza. The main aim was to remove the Arab Kimbulu from Busiba, who was responsible for the traffic and powder supply from Unjanjemde to Unjoro. I sailed west around the lake with 30 boats. Kimbulu and Sultan Motembaa in Busida (before Karagwe), who had succumbed to the Arabs, fled at our approach; the country submitted to the written Mwanga and agreed to pay permanent tribute. There was therefore no battle, as I did not embark on the adventure of a pursuit to the "far west". But the impression of the sudden appearance of my expedition under the German flag from the north was very useful in all these countries If I may also mention that our expedition uncovered the Tana as far as its source and then crossed the country of Moga for the first time: two geographical explorations which had to be undertaken sooner or later, I hope I have proved that the German Colonial Society did not support our enterprise with its moral and material means in a failed cause, but in an expedition which was at least beneficial in the context of the geographical and cultural development of Africa. We were able to penetrate to the borders of the Aquatorial Province despite many difficulties, but naturally we could not be held responsible for the course of development in these areas in the meantime. With the highest regard, Carl Peters.

French Mission Nyagezi near Ukumbi in Usukuma. April 13, 1890. I have the honor to inform the esteemed committee of the German Emin Pasha Committee of the following: On my arrival here in Usukuma, I learn that our expedition has been declared a failure in Europe and that I myself have been declared dead. The comment was made that this had been predicted, that the whole world had known that an expedition like mine could not pass through the Maasai; I had voluntarily run into my own misfortune rc. rc. The honorable committee will permit me to make the following very humble remarks: 1. First of all, I was probably in a better position on the spot than our critics in Europe or on the coast to be able to judge the question of the possibility or impossibility of carrying out my expedition with the means at my disposal. It has never been my intention to risk the lives of people devoted to me like a fool. If I nevertheless went forward with my small column, it was because the difficulties I faced did not seem insurmountable, despite all the talk, and my success proved me completely right. (2) The difference between other people's and my own view of the difficulties at hand can be briefly characterized by the fact that I generally pay very little attention to the initiative of the Arabs and Africans and am therefore always convinced that I can get through with a certain combination of caution and quick conclusions. The dangers of the Masai countries did not impress me. The travelers who reported on them: Thomson and Dr. Fischer never adopted a resolute attitude against these somewhat impudent sons of the steppe, and consequently could not be at all authoritative in judging the dangers of this march. In fact, these dangers are by no means as terrible as one might think, and my march through these territories, although I had only 60 to 70 men in all, was by no means a witchcraft feat, although it had its difficulties and on individual days turned out to be somewhat precarious. I sincerely hope that our example, if followed, will make the so-called "Maasai danger" disappear altogether in a very short time. In any case, there can be no question of my having invested our lives lightly, because I recognized the dangers quite correctly and, as our success has shown, did not underestimate them 3. In general, we seem to have a number of prejudices with regard to travel to Africa, which must be eliminated as quickly as possible in the interest of opening up this part of the world. These include, above all, the belief that one must set out with an excessively large mass of barter goods and porters in order to reach Central Africa. Since each porter consumes an average of 1½ doti of cloth per month, it is easy enough to calculate by what time he will have eaten his own load. And if one believes that the large quantity increases the resistance, I can point out that in this respect everything depends on the organization, which is easier to carry out with a small troop than with a large one. The actual Mgwagwana is weak and drags away the better elements of an expedition by his bad example. Examples of this are the Arab expeditions, thousands strong, which were defeated by the Maasais. The English expeditions in East Africa, which proceeded at the same time as mine and numbered many hundreds, were, I am firmly convinced, not at all so quick-witted and able to resist as mine, in which I know every man, and which is animated by a uniform spirit. Many articles of exchange, however, lead to the danger that any fights are bought off with a tribute, which only hurts the reputation of the white race and increases the naive arrogance of the Africans. I will be pleased if a comparison of the German Emin Pasha expedition with others shows that I have never been guilty of this cardinal error. Success has also taught us that our expedition has been as highly regarded in all countries as befits the dignity of our European race. Even in these countries the hostile parties prefer to flee at our approach, as for example in the west of Nyanza the powerful Arab Kimbulu, who has over a hundred elephant hunters, with all his followers, whom I had undertaken to expel from the country. The tribes who wanted to keep peace with us have always fared well; in all battles, without exception, we have found ourselves in justified self-defense. 4 In this way our expedition, although unfortunately Emin had to leave his country beforehand, which will always be regrettable, was able to work in the spirit that brought us here. The German Emin Pasha expedition was able to explore the entire Tana region and Usoga. We were able to lead Mwanga back to Uganda with his written party and thus create a Christian bulwark against Islam in the north of the Nyanza, annex Uganda to the semi-civilized countries of Africa, such as Zanzibar, by adopting the Congo Act and the principle of the slave trade ban, and sweep the west of the Victoria-Nyanza clean of Arab influences. This was essentially the aim of our movement for the upper Nile countries, through which we hoped to influence the cultural development of Central Africa, of which we rightly regarded Emin Pasha as a pioneer. I believe that people in Europe will be inclined to greatly underestimate the importance of these Emin Pasha expeditions. But perhaps the discerning will appreciate the moral impact that the approach of so many expeditions to rescue an outstanding white man had to have on the whole of Central Africa. This has marked us in these countries as a distinguished race, and that is undiminished for all time. Glory be to Stanley, to whom it was granted to bring Emin Pasha back to the white world. But we have also been able to contribute to the fact that in the minds of the people the abandonment of the position on the upper Nile appears to be only an episode, and that the "Tutarudi" (we will return) is alive in all hearts. If Europe wishes to extend this conviction over the entire north-eastern side of the continent, it will be advisable to send a strong expedition through the Somali and Gallic countries in order to instill in these defiant tribes the feeling of our superiority and finally to avenge the murder of the Deckens. The exploration of the entire Juba region would be the geographical outcome of this expedition, which is indeed a necessity of our time. Such an expedition from quite different ethical and geographical points of departure would naturally have to lead back to the points of view and perhaps also to the final geographical goal of the Emin Pasha expeditions; and thus the last part of the mysterious veil that covers East Africa would be lifted. From the perspective of our own enterprise, it seems to me that the great decisive battle for East Africa, which was fought there between Europeans and Arabs, has now been decided in our favor. Arabism has been defeated across the board. This was achieved primarily by the German imperial campaign under Captain Wißmann. But Stanley, Count Telecki and we were also able to contribute. Stanley, by defeating the tribes between Kongo and Mvtan Nzige, the Wanyoro and Wanera, Telecki. by defeating Wakikuju and Wasuk, we, by successively making clear to the Wagalla, Wadsagga, Wakikuju and Masais, apart from the smaller ones, the superiority of the European Wasse, by supporting the Christian party in Uganda and breaking the Arab influence in the west of the Ryanza, have contributed to the Christianization of East and Central Africa. In the final analysis, therefore, all these undertakings represent a great common whole and the German Emin Pasha expedition must also be understood in this favorable context. If one understands it in this way, perhaps some former opposition to this enterprise would cease, and one will admit that, even if it has apparently failed in its purpose, it has not been in vain in the service of the great moral ideas which are struggling for realization in Africa at this very moment. I have the honor to sign myself with the unchanging esteem of an honored committee, ever devoted Carl Peters." P. S. I expect to be in Zanzibar at the end of June, bringing with me Monscianeur Livinhac, who has been appointed Superieur of the Mission of Algiers. D. O.

In the darkest Africa. - Small announcements
The general meeting of the German Colonial Society in Cologne. (Preliminary report.) The last Annual General Meeting of the Society was overshadowed by its own dark star. Already planned for the autumn of the previous year, it was postponed to mid-June of this year due to difficulties that had arisen and finally moved to June 30 and July 1 in the hope that the presence of Reichskommissar v. Wißmann would give it a special glow and make it a celebration of honor for the deserving man. Unfortunately, this hope was not to be realized due to the illness of the Reichskommissar, as our esteemed President, His Serene Highness Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, was also prevented from attending by an eye complaint, much to his deepest regret. Other distinguished members were held back by parliamentary duties. If the meeting has nevertheless become one of the most important in the annals of our society, thanks are due above all to the Cologne section, whose board and members not only took excellent care of the external arrangements, but also managed to overcome many difficulties through their cordial behavior. One of the younger sections, the Cologne section quickly developed to a high level of prosperity and pursued with great zeal the treatment of certain colonial issues for which it possesses suitable resources. The extremely large attendance at the last meetings also showed very clearly how much the public's interest in colonial issues has been aroused there and how the department has managed to develop into a factor in Cologne's public life that must be reckoned with. Even if the enormous connections that the trade and industry-rich city on the Rhine has on the world market form a good basis for the activities of a colonial society, the example of many other large cities has shown that special efforts are needed to create a fresh and attractive life in the departments for larger circles. Both the board meeting and the general meeting were attended by representatives of the departments and members of the society from near and far, especially from the industrial districts of the Rhineland and Westphalia, so that the meetings on June 30 and July 1 had an impressive character. The Annual General Meeting on June 30. After a ceremonial welcome of the Presidium, the Executive Board and the representatives of the departments by the Executive Board of the Cologne Department had already taken place on June 29 in the Civil Casino and had led to a lively exchange of views on the pending issues, the Executive Board met the next morning for a preliminary consultation, which examined the various motions and set the agenda for the General Meeting in the afternoon. Soon after five o'clock that same day, one of the Society's Vice Presidents, Minister of State von Hofmann, representing the Prince of Hohenlohe=Langenburg, opened the very well attended meeting in the large hall of the Civil Casino. Mr. von Hofmann pointed out that since the last General Assembly, important and momentous changes had taken place in the colonial field through the victories of Major von Wißmann and his brave comrades, as well as through the Anglo-German agreement. Now it was a matter of further developing the colonies under the protection and umbrella of the Reich. He emphasized how the Imperial Chancellor General der Infanterie v. Caprivi had spoken sharply and clearly about the aims of his colonial policy and had thereby elicited the joyful approval of those who wanted to secure the German Empire its share of the distant lands. The speaker did not wish to discuss the Anglo-German agreement now, reserving this for tomorrow's meeting, which would have to deal with this highly important matter, while today's meeting would first have to discuss the Society's internal affairs. Mayor Becker welcomed the meeting on behalf of the City of Cologne. Cologne, the speaker explained, had always been an old colonial city; in the 13th century, Cologne and Rhenish merchants had established their well-known staple places in London. Around the same time and later, Cologne merchants, together with the church, had founded settlements and monasteries in Poland (e.g. Lonk Monastery on the Warta), and in the Baltic provinces the Cologne merchants had colonized and Germanized. For this reason he could say. Cologne is an old colonial city and the German Colonial Society also meets with the liveliest interest here. (Loud applause.) The Secretary General, Dr. Bokemeyer, then gave a few explanations on the printed annual report. We emphasize the following: The report for 1889 states an upward trend for the Society, which had over 17,500 paying members at the end of May. In the course of the past year, a total of 18 new sections came into being, while 23 new sections were formed in the first 5 months of the current year, so that at the end of May there were 171 sections and localities with representatives. The Committee for the Support of Colonial Enterprises has allocated 3000 marks for the Pondoland Society, 5000 marks for the German Herman Settlement Society, 1000 marks for the establishment of a kind of colonial Muscum and other significant amounts for colonial purposes. The German Colonial Newspaper, a very extensive library, map sketches, photographs, wall maps, travelling collections of colonial products and lectures, which were arranged by the central management for the departments or organized for the formation of new departments, served above all to promote colonial knowledge and agitation. Full attention was paid to the conscientious distribution of information in response to inquiries concerning trade and economic conditions in overseas countries and emigration. The majority of inquiries came from people who wanted to emigrate. In order to make the provision of information to emigrants more effective, it has been considered whether it could not be organized in such a way that a number of information bureaus could be spread across Germany under the supervision of the Colonial Society, which would have the task of monitoring the agency system and gaining contact and rapport with the emigrants themselves. Such an agency

Page 174

This would certainly be a blessing, but its implementation encounters the great difficulty that the organized information service can at best accompany the emigrant to the place of disembarkation in the country of arrival, but must then leave him to his fate. A lasting influence can only be resolved in connection with the question of organized emigration. However, an actual solution to the question can only be expected once a major project has been developed that meets all the requirements in terms of capital strength, solidity and large landholdings, and in the implementation of which the Company is involved. The initiative for such a project can undoubtedly only be taken by private individuals to whom the government lends its support in accordance with the general interest involved. The development of Central and South America leads us to expect that German emigrants will once again be offered special advantages by the governments of these countries, but our own colony of South West Africa will probably also come into consideration in the near future when it comes to offering accommodation to some of our emigrants. In order to promote German interests and colonial undertakings, various measures were taken during the year under review, some of which we would like to highlight as being of general interest. In the previous year, the President had asked the Minister of Culture to consider making the Botanical Gardens and the Botanical Museum available for colonial economic purposes, giving detailed reasons. It can be seen from the reply that this important matter will receive the necessary attention. In the interests of domestic industry and plant culture in our colonies, the German Colonial Society will then be able to provide good service in the procurement of seeds and plants (in a similar way to what is done in England). The Colonial Society has also sent several thousand copies of a questionnaire, primarily to doctors in the tropics, in order to clarify certain aspects of tropical hygiene, and has set up its own commission to deal with the matter at the next Naturalists' Day. (Because of the actions of the Riger=Benue=Company, the Presidium and the Committee continued their confessions and protests until the unambiguous declarations of the Reichdregierung communicated to the Reichstag last autumn publicly recognized the injustice of the said company. After the work of the Anticlavery Chamber Mission and the petitions concerning the Imperial Mail Steamer Line to East Africa had been considered, the establishment of a colonial office was discussed in particular. The voices raised within the Society that not one department would suffice, but that an expanded colonial office alone would be able to meet the needs, define the term "matters of a colonial nature" more broadly than the government bill assumes. While the latter has in mind the administration of our colony and what is connected with it, the supporters of an extended colonial office would like to see all matters of overseas economic activity, trade, consular affairs, emigration, etc. united in one office, which would deal with all these matters in separate departments but under one head. Such an organization is highly desirable, but it will only be achieved gradually in view of the far-reaching changes in other departments. It is also to be expected that the progressive development of the overseas economic life of our nation will lead to a modern administrative organization serving the general interests, and this is always better than having a perfect administrative organization, which easily determines the direction and pace of economic development more than is good. The accounts for the year 1889 show a considerable surplus: 104,694.26 marks were received and only 92,694.26 marks were spent (including 1935 marks for unforeseen shortfalls), resulting in a surplus of 12,000 marks. The extraordinary appropriations and support for colonial ventures made in the year under review were covered by this surplus; the support for the Emin Pasha expedition in the amount of 5000 Marks from the previous year could still be covered by the additional income from 1888. Mr. Handelskammersecretair van der Borght once again addresses the harassment of the trade of other nationalities by the Royal Niger Company by means of prohibitive tariffs; he explains the importance of the Niger in terms of trade policy and believes that the German government should not allow the English company to be so sorted, all the less so as German trade has good prospects there. The Assembly must make a public announcement so that the rumor that the freedom of trade on the Niger and Benne was to be completely abolished and that the English Company could allow itself even more arbitrary actions would be silenced. Hopefully the dispatch of the Imperial Commissioner v. Puttkamer would be successful, even if the justified claims of a member of the Empire injured there had not yet been satisfied for three years, which would never have happened with an Englishman. Speaker demands discussion of the matter today. (Bravo!) The rapporteur declined to go into this and referred to the annual report, but agreed with the previous speaker's comments, particularly with regard to the need to ensure freedom of navigation on the Niger. After the report of the five representatives had been read out for the examination of the pitching matters and the representatives had been re-elected for the current year, the discussion moved on to the various motions to amend the statutes, which were explained by Mr. Sachse, Director of the Imperial Post Office, and after a short negotiation were adopted with some amendments, after a motion by the Munich department had been withdrawn. Among those taking part in the debate were Mr. Hamm, Chief Public Prosecutor. Chief District Court President Struckmann and Government Minister of Construction Wiskow. - We will provide more detailed information on these motions shortly, once the amendments to the Articles of Association have been precisely drafted. Director Sachse then gave the following highly interesting and instructive presentation: The postal and telegraph facilities in the German protectorates. Ladies and gentlemen! I have readily complied with the request to tell you something about the postal and telegraph facilities in the German protectorates, even though the subject matter will probably not arouse too much interest in view of the burning questions of the present, and despite the obvious significance of the fact that I am called upon to speak about the activities of an administration to which I myself have the honor of belonging. I believe I am protected from misinterpretation in the latter respect in the circle of benevolent colonial friends. The gratifying upswing which the colonial movement has taken in Germany during the last decade, and the resulting increase in the number of German trading establishments in overseas territories, has naturally assigned the Imperial Post and Telegraph Administration the task of meeting the newly emerging transport needs and tightening the bond between the colony and the mother country. The fulfillment of this task was sought by improving postal steamship connections as far as possible, by establishing a postal system of their own in the more important protectorates and by including them in the scope of the Universal Postal Union. The first reason for the establishment of German postal services in overseas locations was the opening of German postal steamship connections with East Asia and Australia. The history of this latter highly significant achievement is beyond the scope of today's discussion, so I will only briefly mention that the plan to establish these postal steamship lines was first put forward by the State Secretary of the Imperial Post Office, Mr. von Stephan, in a memorandum submitted to the Imperial Chancellor in August 1883, and was presented to the Reichstag in the form of a draft law in May 1884 after approval by the Bundesrat, but unfortunately was not discussed at that time. It was not until the following year, 1885, that the much-disputed draft became law. In the contract concluded with North German Lloyd in Bremen on the basis of the law, the provision was now included that NDL was obliged to have postal service business carried out by these agents in those places abroad in which it maintained agents, in accordance with the more detailed regulations of the Imperial Postal Administration. Accordingly, in September 1886, so-called postal steamship agencies were set up in Apia on the Samoa Islands and Tongatabu in the Tonga Archipelago, while in Shanghai, due to the importance of this location, an Imperial Postal Agency was established from the outset under the administration of a professional postal official. The extent to which this facility met the needs of the traffic can be seen from the fact that on the day of the departure of the first homeward-bound mail steamer, German postage stamps alone were sold for 800 marks at the postal agency in Shanghai. The establishment of German postal establishments on foreign territory as bases for the Reichspost steamship lines was of course only permissible in places that lacked an organized land postal system, although it should be noted that of the major trading states: Great Britain, France, Austria=Hungary, Italy, the United States of America and others to promote the

Page 175

national trade interests are often maintained abroad under similar conditions. Passing over the further development of the postal establishments in Shanghai, Apia and Tongatabu, I turn to the actual German protectorates and, since we are in the Far East, I will begin with German Reugninea, although the chronological order after Cameroon deserves precedence. Since January 1, 1888, Imperial Postal Agencies have been in operation in Finschhafen, where the administration for the protectorate is based, as well as in Konstantinhafen, Hatzfeldhafen, Kerawara and, from December 1889, in Stephansort on the Augusta River. The Reuguinea Company is responsible for their administration by the respective station masters. The postal connection of the protectorate with Europe was initially established in such a way that the line of the British=IndiaSteam=Navigation=Company, which runs every fourth week from London to Bridbane in Queensland through the Torreo Strait, was used as far as the Queensland port of Cooktown, where the mail arrived about 40 days after departure from Berlin. In Cooktown the mail was taken over by a steamer of the New Guinea Company, which brought it to Finschhafen in another 5 days. Since April 1889, however, the connection has been changed so that the mail for German New Guinea is delivered in Genoa every sixth week to the steamers of the Redderland Company, which sail from Amsterdam to Batavia and Soerabaya, and is taken over in Soerabaya by the company steamers. The transportation from Berlin to Finschhafen takes about 55 days. Recently, the German steamship company in Hamburg intends to establish a direct steamship line from Hamburg to the Dutch East Indies. Whether this line can be used with advantage for the transportation of mail at least as far as Batavia is still under consideration. The connection of the protectorate to the international telegraph network has been established in such a way that the Imperial Postal Agencies send the telegrams they receive to the post office in Socrabaya by the nearest ship and from there receive the telegrams destined for New Guinea by the Brie mail. After the Marshall Islands were placed under German protection, a postal agency was established in the main town of Jaluit on October 1, 1888, which, however, only relies on irregularly scheduled sailings to and from Sidney, San Francisco, Honolulu, etc. for its connections. The transportation of mail will remain imperfect until a regular steamship service is available. Of the black part of the world, let us first consider the west coast. The German settlements in Cameroon were exclusively dependent on the use of the British steamship lines of the Steamship Company and the British and African Steam Navigation Company, and thus on the detour via Liverpool, for their traffic with their homeland until the beginning of the nineteen-twenties. The situation only changed in 1882 when the Woermann shipping company in Hamburg established a regular steamship connection between Hamburg and several places on the west coast. Soon after the opening of the new line, the Imperial Postal Administration reached an agreement with the company, on the basis of which it was granted the right to fly the postal flag and was entrusted with the transportation of letters between Germany and the landing places on the west coast of Africa in return for payment of the sea transit charges provided for by the Universal Postal Union. However, as there was no national post office in the African ports of call, the items had to be delivered by the settlers on board the ships and collected there. As you will recall, the second steamship bill of 1884 also provided for an African line with an annual budget of one million marks, which was to extend from Germany via Dakar, Angra=Pequena and Capstadt to Delagoabai. However, it was rejected in the Reichstag by 166 votes to 157, i.e. with a majority of only 9 votes. The question arises as to how the German balance of power and ownership on the African coasts would have developed to this day if regular German mail steamers, such as those going to East Asia and Australia, had touched the main places on the African coasts for 4 years. The other steamer leaves Hamburg on the last day of each month and reaches Cameroon via Madeira and some places on the west coast of Africa within 30 days, calling at Victoria as required. In addition, the two English lines and the French mail steamers, which depart from Marseilles and Bordeaux respectively, are also used by the Germans, so that for both Cameroon and Togo there are three transport services per month with a journey time of 24 to 30 days. For the transportation of mail, the Woermann company received the following from the Imperial Postal Fund, according to the Universal Postal Union rates of 15 francs per kilogram of letters and postcards and 1 franc per kilogram of printed matter and samples: 71 marks, 1882 In the first year 1883 In the year... 1885 2019 4740 1887 6200 1889 i.e. an increase from 71 marks to 6200 marks in 5 years. Once the protective relationship between the territories of Cameroon and Togo had been regulated by law, the postal administration immediately set about consolidating the postal conditions there. First of all, an Imperial Postal Agency was set up in Cameroon in February 1887, the administration of which was initially entrusted to a servant of the governor, but later to a professional postal officer as traffic increased. After the incorporation of the area on the Ambas=Bai, a postal agency was also established in Victoria, which opened for business in September 188. The district assigned to this agency extends from Rio del Rey to Bimbia In the Togo region, postal agencies have been established 1. in Klein=Popo since March 1, 1888 and 2. in Lome since March 1, 1890, which is currently our youngest child abroad. As it is often not possible to land at Klein=Popo due to the high seas, the mail is usually landed in the English Quittah and sent to the postal agencies in Lome and Klein=Popo by courier. On July 1, 188, an Imperial Postal Agency came into operation in Otyimbingue for the West African territory, which is administered by Police Master von Goldammer. However, as a result of the known events in those areas, he had to leave Otyimbingue on December 1, 1888 and went via Walfischbai first to Garinnab and in October to Tsaobis. At present, Mr. von Goldammer will presumably administer the postal agency in Otyimbingue again. Unfortunately, there is no direct regular connection for the German protectorate in South West Africa; the mail there is transported by English steamers via Lisbon to Cape Town; from Cape Town, every available shipping opportunity is used to send the mail to Walfischbai, from where it reaches the German postal agency in Otyimbinque by messenger mail. The postal situation in the Witu region was rather sad when the Germans took over patronage. According to the descriptions that have reached us here, the letter sacks that arrived in Lamu on the British India steamers were opened by the customs officer, an Indian who could not read European writing; the contents were poured onto the floor and then it was left to everyone to pick out their mail. For the delivery of mail in Lamu, a two-part, open box was set up, one part of which was intended for letters to be sent to the north and the other to the south. Registered letters were not permitted at all. Anyone wishing to send such letters had to contact an authorized agent in Zanzibar. In November 1888, an imperial postal agency was set up in Lamu in order to better safeguard the interests of the Germans living in the Witu region; however, there is nothing particularly positive to report about its effectiveness, if only because the connections, for which one had to rely exclusively on England, were very poor and because disputes between the few Germans living there became a source of incessant complaints. It seems doubtful whether the German post office in Lamu will continue to exist at all after the recent change in the overall situation. The only German protectorate in which there is still no German post office is German East Africa. The reason for this is perhaps that the German East African Society did not apply to the Imperial Government in time. Later, the uprising on the coasts intervened, and when the uprising was put down by our Wißmann Africanus (Applause), it must have seemed expedient,

The German authorities have agreed to set up the postal facilities at the same time as the new steamer line is launched. All preparations for the establishment of a German postal agency in Zanzibar have now been made; the postal officer appointed to manage it will leave for East Africa on the first Woermann steamer; whether he will stay permanently in Zanzibar remains to be seen. The plan is to set up several postal agencies at the German coastal locations and to place them under a main agency, which will probably have its headquarters in Dar es Salaam or Bagamoyo As far as the new steamer line is concerned, you know that the Imperial Postal Administration has made a sincere contribution to its achievement and implementation (applause). The contract with the Deutsch=Ostafrika-Gesellschaft has been concluded on the proven basis of the NDL contract. Using the utmost high pressure, it has also been achieved that the first steamer will leave Hamburg as early as July 23. However, the first voyages are provisionally to be carried out in intervals of two months, while the final factory plan with monthly voyages will not begin until March 1891. The steamer, which is to make the first voyage, is built by Blohm & Voss in Hamburg and has been given the name "Bundesrath". It has already been approved by the Reich's inspection commission. The "Bundesrath" has a speed of 11½ knots (great cheerfulness) and has room for 48 passengers. The sister ship, which is to be christened "Reichstag", is also already ready. In November of last year, the British=India=Steam=Navigation=Company, which had previously been responsible for transportation to the east coast of Africa, concluded a new contract with the British postal administration, according to which the former Bombay=Aden=Zanzibar route was converted into a direct line from London to Zanzibar. However, this new contract has nothing worrying for us. The English have understandably refrained from overbidding in terms of size and speed of the ships, as has often happened elsewhere. The new German mail steamer lines will therefore be able to complement the English and the existing French lines between Marseilles and Madagascar in such a way that mail shipments will be offered several times a month. The mail will probably be delivered to the German steamers in Naples and reach Dar es Salaam, or Zanzibar, in about 21 days after departure from Berlin. Let me add a few words about the way our postal agencies operate abroad. The local accommodation was not always easy. In some places, however, quite nice little houses were available; the photographs on display here, which come from our Postal Museum, give an idea of this. In other places the difficulties were all the greater. Mr. von Goldammer, for example, had to make do with a shrub hut as a post office on his return from Otyimbingne in Garinnab. However, the resourcefulness and dedication of the officials overcame all difficulties. The most necessary postal equipment is sent from here. There is not too much to it, and the Imperial Postal Administration has some experience in these matters from the campaigns. If you are interested, you need only visit the local war exhibition, where a box is on display in the field post department, as it is given to officials on their journey to set up field post stations. With the help of such a box, a post office can be set up in an hour, which lacks neither the Reich coat of arms and the mailbox on the outside, nor the sorting bags and all other accessories for internal operation. The administrators of the postal agencies are chosen partly from professional civil servants, who are then usually active in the consular service, partly from other suitable personalities. They have to provide a deposit and are specially obliged to maintain the secrecy of correspondence. Recently, the postal agent and customs administrator in Klein=Popo applied to the Imperial Post Office to send blacks to Germany for training in the post office box and then to employ them at the agencies in Africa, in line with the procedure in England. An idea that will perhaps have to be explored further. An application for the supply of uniforms for the black postmen has also been submitted to the Imperial Post Office. A white cap has already been delivered to them. However, a white suit with orange trim and post horns on the collar and sleeves as badges was also to be added. "Such a uniform," says the applicant, "not only makes the people more reliable, as it raises their pride and vanity, and it would be the greatest pain for them to lose their uniform, but would also give the messengers a great reputation and thus increased safety on their rounds." The request was at least partially granted. The operation of the foreign agencies is regulated according to domestic standards and principles. The upper management of the postal agencies in the German protectorates is carried out by the Imperial Post Office; the foreign postal agencies are only assigned to the higher postal directorates in Hamburg and Bremen with regard to current service and accounting matters. Traffic at these establishments has so far developed in a very pleasing manner. For example, the total number of items handled by the postal agency in Cameroon in the first year of its existence amounted to 11,700 items weighing around 12 hundredweight. In 1889, the total number of letters for the German protectorates in Africa amounted to 50,240; in 1889, 46 parcels were exchanged in New Guinea, 104 in Samoa and 691 in Cameroon. The revenues are also not inconsiderable, amounting to 1800 Mk. for 1889 for the postal agencies in New Guinea, 1251 Mk. in Klein Popo, 310 Mk. in Victoria and 4262 Mk. in Cameroon. All the protectorates are currently affiliated to the Universal Postal Union. Ordinary and registered parcels can therefore be sent everywhere, letters to and from Cameroon, Togo, New Guinea, Apia and Tongatabu, letters and parcels with a value of up to 8000 Mk. to Cameroon, postal money orders to Cameroon and Togo. The introduction of the postal money order service with New Guinea is imminent The rates for letters are consistently those of the Universal Postal Union, i.e. 20 pfennigs for letters up to 15 g, 10 pfennigs for postcards, 5 pfennigs for printed matter and samples for every 50 g. What this means for the facilitation of traffic only becomes clear when one considers that England has until recently maintained the rate of 4 to 6 pence or 32 to 50 pfennigs for a single letter for most of its colonies, and that it took major battles and government conferences in Australia to achieve a reduction to half this amount in traffic between the Australian colonies and the mother country. We have a similar situation with parcel and postal order traffic. Whereas a parcel weighing up to 5 kg to overseas destinations used to cost up to 30 Mk. postage, a parcel of up to this weight can now be sent to New Guinea for 4.25 Mk., to Cameroon and Togo even for 1.6 Mk. and to most of the places on the major mail steamer routes for 3.0 to 3 Mk. postage. The German protectorates have not yet been able to set up their own telegraph systems for telegraph traffic in the Reich. This is due to the high cost of undersea cables and to the fact that wherever German postal agencies exist, the handling of telegrams until they reach the first cable station has been carried out by the postal agents. At present, however, steps are being taken both for Cameroon and the Togo region, as well as for East Africa, to make German telegraph operations as independent as possible of foreign administrations at the starting and end points. For East Africa in particular, a contract has recently been concluded with the Eastern and South African Telegraph Company for the laying of a cable from Zanzibar via Bagamoyo to Dar es Salaam. This cable would then be rented by Germany for a certain annual fee. The intention is to gradually connect all those coastal ports by telegraph which the steamers of the Woermann Line can call at. First, however, the question of whether the lines should be laid underground or above ground is still under consideration. The obstacle to an above-ground line is that the wooden poles will be eaten away by termites in a very short time. The question then arises as to whether iron poles would be suitable for the East African conditions. Such iron rods were already used 15 years ago on the line between Berlin and Königs-Wusterhausen, and then also elsewhere in Switzerland, Bavaria, Spain, Brazil, Australia, Australia. Spain, Brazil, Australia, as well as on the Anglo-Indian line; however, the judgment on the usefulness of such systems for experts does not yet seem to be complete. As far as the plans for cable connections for Cameroon and Togo are concerned, they have not yet progressed to the point where I could provide information about them here.

The German Postal and Telegraph Union of the German protectorates has put 12 of its own postal agencies into operation and prepared the establishment of several others; that, furthermore, steps have been taken to make the telegraphic traffic of the protectorates as far as possible independent of foreign facilities, that all newly established postal establishments there have been included in the scope of the Universal Postal Union, and that, as a result, the formerly very high postage rates have been reduced to the modest level of the world postal rate. I may assume that these factual statements will strengthen your conviction that the head of the German postal and telegraph system, who has already rendered so much service to the national transportation facilities, is also following the colonial development with the liveliest interest. gentlemen, to ensure that the Imperial Postal and Telegraph Administration continues to find cause for extensive activity in this field in the future, which serves the common good." (Lively bravo.) The assembly had listened to the speaker with great excitement; Excellency v. Hofmann spoke in their spirit when he thanked Director Sachse and at the same time State Secretary Pr. v. Stephan, who had contributed so benevolently and energetically to the prosperity of our colonies. Dr. Friedrichs then spoke about the legal situation of the natives in the German protectorates, but limited himself to the penal views of the natives because the subject matter was too large. He stated as a principle that they only have success in mind and do not, as we do, distinguish between intent, negligence, and so on. This view is particularly important because it gives rise to allegedly completely unfounded attacks on whites. A number of interesting details enlivened the lecture, which concluded with a resolution calling for an in-depth investigation into the legal status of the natives and asking the Society's Board of Directors to draw up a program to this end. Dr. Hindorf then spoke about the development of New Guinea. He regarded the transfer of sovereignty to the empire and the new shipping connection with Soerabaya as the starting points of a new major development. The stationmasters could now devote all their activities to economic purposes, and from Soerabaya they would receive the Malay workers needed for the plantations. So we can expect a lot from this colony. That was the end of the presentations. Nuremberg was chosen as the venue for the next general meeting and 26 board members were elected, whose names will be published as soon as the gentlemen have given their consent. The public meeting on July 1. The general meeting of the Society was followed on July 1 by a public meeting in the large, decorated hall of the Leiegesellschaft, which was extremely well attended in accordance with the importance of the lectures and the significance of the speakers. Many officers and also members of the clergy, with the Archbishop at the head, took part in the meeting. We would all have been pleased to welcome the man who, through his activities in East Africa, has contributed mightily to the welfare of the German fatherland and to the promotion of civilizational endeavours in Africa. We all hoped to see Major v. Wißmann among us and to express our appreciation and thanks to him face to face. Unfortunately, Major v. Wißmann's already fragile health, which has recently become even worse, has forced him to stay away from here. Nevertheless, we are able to express our feelings for the man who, in a relatively short time, has rendered immortal service and accomplished the task assigned to him by His Majesty the Emperor with admirable energy, unparalleled prudence and brilliant success. He struck powerful blows against the slave trade and, we hope, put an end to the slave trade in those regions for all time. He has increased the fame of the German name and restored our power in East Africa. (Loud applause.) I ask you to rise from your seats in accordance with parliamentary custom as a sign and expression of our admiration and gratitude for Major v. Wißmann and his brave officers. (Done.) At a board meeting yesterday, we decided to recognize Wißmann's outstanding services on the part of the Colonial Society by making him an honorary member of our society. (Lively applause.) The large attendance at this meeting is a brilliant and encouraging testimony to the efforts of the Colonial Society. We, the management, sometimes need such refreshment and encouragement in the face of the many obstacles and difficulties with which we have to contend. Your participation is all the more grateful as the recent events in colonial politics have surprised us and in some cases painfully affected us. But I hope that we will be able to document full unity in this meeting. I would like to thank all those present, especially the high authorities who are represented. We also have a visitor from East Africa, the Superior General of the Missionary Society of the Holy Spirit in Bagamoyo, a society which has made a generally recognized contribution to the spread of Christian morals in Africa. (Applause.) We will now hear the announced speeches by Major Liebert, Professor Fabr and Consul Vohsen and a series of resolutions concerning the German-English agreement will then be presented to you, on which the Board has already reached agreement and which will hopefully be adopted unanimously: Major Liebert (warmly welcomed): I have gladly accepted the invitation of the President, Prince von Hohenlohe=Langenburg, to give a report here in Cologne on the military situation in East Africa. It fills me with pride and joy to be able to work for our national cause here in Cologne. I spent most of my service in the East and know how dead the East, with the cities of Breslau, Königsberg and Danzig, still is for our colonial cause today. Here in Cologne, on the other hand, in the center of the Rhenish-Westphalian industry, in the center of the wholesale trade that sends its ships down the Rhine across the ocean, here you can feel the pulse of national life. Yesterday, we already had the opportunity to feel this pulse, which is so warm on the Rhine and can also be heard so strongly in southern Germany; indeed, we have almost had to curb the national overzealousness. On the other hand, I am also disappointed. I had hoped to be able to speak in the presence of my friend Wißmann and to present his deeds and successes in his presence. I believed that this would enable me to express some of my gratitude for the reception I received from the Reichskommissar, his officers and the Schutztruppen, whose comrades-in-arms I had the honor of being. At 3 o'clock last night I received the following telegram from Major v. Wißmann: "Please express my heartfelt thanks to the assembly for the planned reception. As honored as I feel, it is all the more difficult for me not to be able to express my feelings personally. My condition is such, however, due to a fever I contracted today, that I will probably not even be able to travel home. On entering Europe I have had an uninterrupted chain of excitements to which my constitution, which has been somewhat worn out by twelve years in Africa, has suddenly reacted. With warm greetings to all acquaintances and friends of our cause, with the request to represent me where necessary. Yours, Wißmann." The situation in East Africa cannot be better characterized than by a description of the situation from April 1889 to the same date. The speaker then described in detail the period of the uprising in Pangani from midsummer 1888 and the destruction of all but two of the German stations, the battles with Buschiri and his capture, the battles at Mpuapna and Lieutenant Giese's rescue. The recapture of Mpuapua was a great political and moral success, indeed of world-historical significance, when Stanley's and Emin Pasha's caravan saw the German flag flying 300 kilometers from the coast in the interior of Africa. Emin Pasha told me that he was filled with pride to find the German flag here. (Loud applause.) Stanley had to take down his flag, and the caravan moved to the coast under the German flag. (Loud applause.) After an account of Bana=Heri's resistance and fall, the speaker turned to the time of his presence in Africa. When I arrived in Zanzibar on March 2, I received the news about Bana=Heri from Wißmann, and Wißmann asked me to come along. So I saw the Schutztruppe on night marches, in camp, in firefights and learned to marvel at them. In addition, the terrain was rugged, bushy and confusing. Fortunately, African diplomacy helped us. Treaties were concluded with the chiefs and Bana=Heri was starved out with about 1000 men. After a treaty with v. Gravenreuth, BanaHeri received permission to settle in his homeland, and now we have gained a friend in him. Redner then gave a brief description of the south, Kilwa and Lindi. Wißmann had thus fulfilled his task in the course of a year. Not only had he conquered the coast in this short military drama, but he had also pacified the country 300 km into the interior and absolutely stopped the slave trade and strengthened German interests in such a way that we can speak of our brilliant position of power in East Africa. (Loud applause.) The troops that have established our power there are Su

Page 178

Danes, Zulus and Askaris. Wißmann has done a masterful job with the Sudanese; they come from the upper Nile, are strict Mohamedans and are therefore subject to strict discipline. They are professional soldiers who serve in the troops from the age of 20 until well past the age of 60. I have seen two soldiers who fought under Mehemed Ali and Moltke at the Battle of Nisib in 1839; that was 50 years ago, so these soldiers must be between 65 and 70 years old and are still at the front. This proves toughness and desire and love of the craft. I would also like to talk about the physical constitution of the Schutztruppen. I saw wounded blacks there, one had a bullet in his lung, one had both hands pierced, another had a bullet lodged in the back of his head so that it could be touched with a probe. All these people soon recovered. (Great amusement.) The one with the bullet in the back of the head was able to straighten his bed himself three days after the wound. (Great amusement.) These people have a very poorly developed nervous system, have almost no feeling of pain and do not enjoy alcohol (Applause.) We hope to retain these men, who have women and children with them, as a tribe of troops and to educate the children in a Christian and German way through troop schools. The Zulus are also good soldiers who have only had misfortune in battle and must first be brought up in strict habituation to the service. I liked them, they are willing and obedient; they have no names, but call themselves after their superiors. So it happens that a popular company commander has 30 to 40 men who bear his name and only then call themselves by their number. (Great amusement.) I have seen Zulus who sang the whole song "Heil dir im Sieger kranz" on the march. They can't speak German, but they sang the song quite nicely. From this you can see how the Oifiziere engage with the troops and try to draw them to themselves, as in our army. (Applause.) I wish that many of you in Africa could see what exemplary order prevails in the stations. (Applause.) You can see the German spirit prevailing and officers and soldiers acting as bringers of culture. Every native rises before the European and says his greeting. The natives are accustomed to street cleanliness, street lighting and building houses according to straight lines. It is a pleasant impression. The competitors can already admire our way of colonizing. (Lively applause) We now have permanent sites on the coast that can be described as fortresses. In three months' time, the three southern sites will be completed - they are being built very quickly, and I hope that the sites will be in order by the end of August. I warn against taking over demountable houses and iron constructions. The best way to build there is with an excellent coral stone quarried on the coast: lime is burnt on the spot, and straight-trunked mangrove wood is added. These three materials are used to build Arab-style, solid houses with flat roofs. The Europders live on the second floor, and the floor of the house is used for the Reger doorkeepers and storerooms. The health of the troops has thus been greatly improved. And Major von Wißmann deserves thanks for this alone. Now the objection has been made to me that now that peace has been established on the coast, troops are no longer necessary there, as the liberal party à la Hannibal Fischer said, or at least should be greatly reduced. I must oppose this very firmly. We must send out patrols along the coast and occupy posts to absolutely prevent the smuggling of human goods. We must also send expeditions into the interior to protect caravan routes and mission stations. We want our colonization to be Christian. Therefore, it is the duty of the Empire to ensure that not a single missionary is unprotected. Such an expedition is on its way under Emin Pasha to Lake Victoria=Nyanza. We must also send teams to Tabora, where Father Schynse had to leave the Kipalapala station. Work is to be resumed in Ujiji, as the slave trade has flourished most at this port so far. We would then have a line of 1100 kilometers protected by fixed military stations. In the northwest we have to occupy one of the richest and most prosperous countries Karagwe, which borders on the English sphere of interest, and in the south Lake Ryassa with 4 stations. We must also ensure that the three large lakes Victoria=Nyanza, Tanganyika and Nyassa, which have fallen to us as our share, are navigated by German steamships. (Loud applause.) Only in this way can we develop cultural work there in a definite manner and safely and reliably initiate lively trade. However, this is costly. The steamboats have to be dismantled, transported across the country and reassembled. On behalf of my friend Wißmann, I ask that the City of Cologne, the Colonial Association or the major industrialists of the Rhineland and Westphalia make funds available in some form for this purpose. It would be an uplifting feeling if the first steamer on Lake Nyassa bore the name "City of Cologne". (Stormy applause and hand clapping. Ruse: Very good!) I myself am a soldier and am enthusiastic about military activity. I praise the martial laurels that Wißmann has won. But higher is the civic crown that must be earned by those who take over the German administration in East Africa. Imagine a country that has been without peace for thousands of years, where the population has only a very loose tribal community, where every village is surrounded by pallisade fortifications, where only weapons provide personal security, where no one cultivates the wonderfully rich soil for fear that tomorrow he will lose what he has sown today, a country without religion and sast without customs, caught up in the strongest superstition. I brought an instrument with me, a gourd filled with asen hair and strings of pearls. This was Bushiri's talisman in the battle against the Germans. The Askaris stood trembling in front of it when it was taken from Buschiri. In one part of the country, a third of all newborns are killed out of superstition. The person who goes there now and takes over the administration has behind him a small but proud and powerful force and can fulfill the task we set him, namely, that he brings peace to the population, that he spreads full confidence in German protection, that he educates the people to work, builds roads and arranges for the products to be pulled out of the ground and brought to the German roads. Even if the free-minded make me out to be an incorrigible optimist, the military situation is a splendid one. The German soldier has done his duty. I hope that the merchant, the technician and the engineer will now do the same and that the country, which until now has seen only the military, will now also see cultural workers. (Lively applause.) I can express myself no better about the man who is now going there than with Goethe's words: "If I open rooms for millions to live safely here and actively there". I hope that Wißmann will take on this task with his rich experience and his knowledge of Reger's heart. If he takes it on, let us wish him the best of success. (Repeated lively applause. The Chairman then gave the floor to Professor Dr. Fabri:) It is pleasant when the speaker approaches the subject matter he is to discuss with a certain warmth and enthusiasm. I do not have this advantage today, because I have very mixed feelings as I prepare to discuss the German-English agreement. In any case, it cannot remain undiscussed at this association, which joins the general meeting of the German Colonial Society. Of course, I am not speaking on behalf of the Board of the German Colonial Society, I am only giving you my personal opinion as a German colonial friend and colonial politician. Let me first outline in a few lines the impression that the German-English agreement has created. The English press - apart from a few careless remarks during the first few days - immediately expressed its full approval of the treaty, which soon turned into enthusiasm and jubilation. Cameron, Mackinnon and even Stanley are today singing the praises of the Marquis Salisbury. In Germany, the mood has been reversed. Whereas in the first few moments the impressive impression of the return of Heligoland and the joy of having come to an agreement with England at all predominated, today the conviction that we have come up short, indeed that our entire colonial political development in Africa has been stopped by England, is widespread in the widest circles. As from the camp of our colonial opponents, we have also recently heard the call from the circle of colonial friends: Under these circumstances, we would probably do best to leave the whole of German East Africa to England. This disgruntlement is understandable, but there can be no question of our throwing in the towel. In the other countries of Europe the treaty is naturally regarded only from a general political point of view, and the Austrian and Italian press rejoice in it as a sign of England's strong rapprochement with the Triple Alliance. The attitude of the French and Russian press is noteworthy; in the first few days, it betrayed a certain amount of concern: Der deutsch=englische Vertrag. Cologne 1890. Published by the M. Dumont=Schauberg bookshop.

Page 179

but has recovered from it. We are moving towards an agreement that is as unbiased as possible. It goes without saying that mutual concessions must be made in colonial policy agreements. In Germany, too, many far-reaching demands were made in the course of the negotiated agreements, albeit mostly in a timid form. All the more powerful were the efforts in England, where a well-organized campaign against the Germans in Africa had been waged for months under Stanley's leadership, and it was primarily this movement that defeated us. If you look at the agreement, you will find Germany in retreat on all points in Africa. But not only that, we are also renouncing the future. If we look at the borders, we see German territory in South-West Africa and in East Africa enclosed on all sides by England and thus threatened, if not paralyzed, in its natural conditions for development. The most disadvantageous points of the agreement for Germany, however, are two: the handing over of the island of Zanzibar to England in the form of protection, and the directional handing over of Walsischbai to Germany. Let me speak frankly. Since England and Germany met in competition on the island of Zanzibar, the Sultan's retirement could only be a matter of time. All the agreements made in the meantime could only represent a gradual transition to this fact. However, they necessarily created a highly complex and unclear situation at first. The agreement has brought political clarity to these entanglements. The Sultan has retired. This fact is not only a favorable but a necessary development for German East Africa; a formally clear relationship has finally been created. Only private companies could get involved in the previous legal confusion. With the political retirement of the Sultan, the only previously justified objection to the transformation of German East Africa into a German crown colony has now been removed (it is quite impossible to have German East Africa administered by a company. Nowhere in the world has there been and still is rule and the peace and order it provides, as the basis of all civilization, without the corresponding development of power. Today, however, this can only be granted and maintained by organized states. The development of the Congo State, which was created at such great private sacrifice and which is now to become Belgian and probably must become Belgian, provides striking proof of this. Only when German East Africa has become a crown colony will the German East African Society also find a clear, feasible and worthwhile task. Should its loan have failed, let it console itself. As soon as German East Africa becomes an imperial colony, the necessary capital will flow to the company and the expenses of the empire will soon be covered as well as in Cameroon, indeed amply. If you look at the map of East Africa, you can see how Zanzibar had to become the starting point and center of trade and civilization for the whole of East Africa. The cession of the island of Zanzibar to England thus opens up a fierce economic struggle between the English and the Germans on the East African coast for many years to come. We must create trading centers on the coast in order to leave Zanzibar fallow. I hope, I believe, that we will remain victorious, however great England's trading power and capital wealth may still be. You see, I cannot join those who declare German East Africa worthless without Zanzibar. But I consider it impolitic and contrary to the spirit and intention of the treaty, which after all aims at friendly understanding, to include unnatural provisions injurious to one party, which would make the immediate opening of a fierce economic war between the Germans and the English a necessity, and which might well harbor in their bosom the arousal of disturbances, easily more tangible and stronger than those hitherto. Everything would have been easier if Zanzibar had finally become German. And a cheap compensation was, so to speak, obvious here. The larger island of Pemba, much richer in plantations, could have been left to England, and this would have been a very fraternal division in the Indian Ocean. And the Walvis Bay in South West Africa! I was more astonished by the Anglo-German agreement than by the fact that the Welsh Bai was also retained by England. (Sustained applause.) Let us hope that the reserved demarcation means the cession in prospect. I shall pass over the other provisions of the treaty as briefly as possible, gentlemen. Wituland and the southern Somali coast have been ceded to England. Germany is cut off from the mouths of the rivers Tana and Dschub. The cession of Wituland is even more saddening. Of all the colored potentates with whom German colonial policy has so far come into contact, Sultan Achmed von Witn is the most intelligent and full of character. The Emperor of Germany has placed him under his protection - this declaration of protection has been renewed and confirmed this very year - and he has honored this relationship with a certain chivalrous loyalty. (Bravol) I regret that he and his people are now unreservedly at the mercy of the English, who have little sympathy for him. In view of our national honor, it would be advisable to consider without delay whether some protection could not be secured for him or whether his and his people's resettlement in German East African territory could be made possible. The southern border of German East Africa is the Rovuma River and thus Portugal remains our neighbor. It is striking that the Tunghibai, to which the Sultan of Zanzibar, apparently supported by England, has laid claim, is not mentioned in the agreement. If England were to establish herself here, it would hardly be long before a wide channel was opened to Lake Nyassa. If England establishes itself on the right bank of the Rovuma, German East Africa is in fact surrounded on almost all sides by the English. We come to the western border of East Africa. I find the entire line drawn at Nyassa and along the Stevenson Road to Tan Ganyika and up to the border of the Congo State quite appropriate. It has been regretted that the valuable Kingdom of Uganda has not been included in the German sphere of interest. Dr. Peters has concluded a treaty of friendship with the King of Uganda, but it seems to me a justifiable and necessary concession that Uganda should be included in the English sphere of interest. Some of the border definitions here should be clearer, for example, when a mountain (Mfumbiro), which Stanley saw from afar but no European has yet set foot on and determined its location, is designated as the southern border for Uganda instead of being defined in degrees. This detail clearly shows how much Stanley's proposals influenced the British ministry. But who gave expert advice in Berlin? It may be 20000 German square miles and more which we have transferred to the British sphere of interest in a formal agreement. On the other hand, we have received nothing in Africa. But you mentioned Heligoland: someone, I think it was an English statesman, said that Heligoland in British possession was like a wart on the face of Germany. Now warts are not ornamental, but neither are they a particular evil, at least in the face of a powerful man. Of course, it may be somewhat different if you imagine Germany as a woman, as Germania. But joking aside, the matter is actually a serious one. It is a certain point of national honor that the Frisian cliff - a good half square kilometer in size, 3000 times smaller than Zanzibar - so close to the mouth of the Elbe, returned to German possession. But if we take the sum total of these considerations, we come, whether we like it or not, to the following conclusion: England, accustomed to good business, has made a splendid bargain with this Anglo-German agreement, as never before. Stanley, who is in a position to judge, has just said: "We get a new suit of clothes for a button on our pants. What caused such an agreement? What made it possible? It is undeniable that for a good three years there had been a certain weariness on the part of the Imperial Government towards our colonial policy endeavors. Thus the German colonial acquisitions actually became primarily objects of compensation vis-à-vis England. This is the only explanation for the fact that the rape of German traders on the Niger has not yet been stopped. Only in this way can it be explained that a British admiral and British sub-officials were able to rape the German Emin Pasha expedition without any intervention from Berlin. How, in my opinion, public opinion in England would have been in an uproar if Germany had taken similar action against an English expedition! The second reason for the unfavorable outcome of the Anglo-German agreements lies in a shortcoming that is weighing more and more heavily on our colonial policy from year to year. As inexperienced newcomers, we have quickly come into possession of overseas countries. We need a colonial authority of our own The excessive haste with which the treaty was pursued by Germany must also have had a damaging effect. That's right, we are essentially dealing with political aspects here. We are told, somewhat mysteriously, that the general political situation compels us to move closer to England. England has joined the Triple Alliance; a formal alliance is said to have been concluded between Russia and France. Mr. President, allow me to speak quite frankly here too. The word "the political situation demands it" is the magic word that has been used in Germany for years.

Page 180

The tenth century has carefully avoided any discussion of foreign policy issues. But there are hardly any political secrets left today; why should not the public debate, the parliamentary negotiation, look these political constellations clearly and firmly in the eye! England, firmly on the side of the Triple Alliance, would be an event that can only be a welcome message to every German, to every friend of European peace. If the great war of nations breaks out, which will extend its shocks from Gibraltar to Kamschatka, England will only have the choice of an attempt at neutrality or joining the Triple Alliance. The Triple Alliance is already England's best protection. It has often been asked in the last week: Can this treaty, which is humiliating for Germany, not still be stopped, still be made invalid? The path that enthusiastic German colonial friends in Switzerland have suggested by means of an appeal distributed by many thousands: "Germany wake up!", that the German people should rise up unanimously to bring about the tearing up of the treaty, will of course hardly be able to count on success. Should we now, Mr., become despondent? Just as in the life of the individual man success is only gained and his character developed and ennobled through toil and labor, so it is in the life of nations. This basic law applies twice as much when they set about new tasks as we do in colonial policy. It is important to learn and not to be discouraged by mistakes and setbacks Everything is changeable in this world, even in the life of nations. Only on European battlefields will the great shifts in colonial possessions be decided in the future. Nobody knows what the future will bring in this direction. But I do know one thing, and in concluding I want to impress this on our minds together. The nation that does the most for Africa by straining its economic, moral and intellectual strength, that works in a truly humane way to educate the people, that closes Africa's festering wound, the slave trade, with understanding and strength, that does not give priority to spirit water, but to the blessings of the people who bring Christian civilization to the world of government, that nation will also be the future of Africa - that is our German-African programme. (Loud applause. Mr. Consul Vohsen!) spoke about the economic changes that the German-English agreement will have for German East Africa. Our influence on Zanzibar was still very strong at the beginning of the first half of the year, and had the most favorable effect on the negotiations that Redner conducted with the late Sultan. Now we are faced with a fait accompli and must continue to build on it. We have a clear goal in mind and can move towards it. I firmly deny that the board of the German-East African Society changed its views on a hint from above, but I have confidence that our government acted in this way because it had to, although we do not know the reasons. After all, we are left with a large and rich possession, we are left with the coast, and Zanzibar's trade depends on it. Freedom of trade exists, but not freedom from customs duties, only a right of transit is granted to the English. Would you trade Sausibar for the mainland? I would prefer to keep what we have. The importance of the countries in the Upper Nile Delta has also been overestimated; their natural outlet remains the Ril, even if it is now blocked by the Mahdist uprising. The exclusion of European trade from the coast was a matter of survival for the Arab slave traders; this disgraceful trade brought Zanzibar into prosperity, but at the same time held back the development of the mainland. Now that the mainland is politically and customs-wise separated from the islands, a change must occur. (Trade, albeit small and independent of Zanzibar, has existed before. Zanzibar has only one rhede, Dar es Salaam is an excellent port, and not the only one. I hear that the coastal towns are to be connected to each other and to Zanzibar by telegraph. Dar=es=Salaam should become the seat of the central administration. It should be noted that the monsoons often make traffic between the coastal towns and Zanzibar extremely difficult - this circumstance also makes the coastal towns less dependent on the island; with the help of the steamer lines they will be able to take on the competition with confidence. The population of the island of Gorée on the Senegalese coast has fallen by half since 1878, mainly due to emigration to the mainland. The company hopes to complete its factories again next year; the Usambara region is one of the most fertile in Africa and the conditions are favorable for the construction of a railroad. An effective dam has been built on the coast to prevent the export of slaves, and the major caravan routes are being prepared for 1) Consul Vohsen's speech will also be published in an expanded form in a brochure, to which we draw our readers' attention in particular, as it will provide interesting statistical material. D. R.
The plantation company is already operating alongside the German-East African one, but there is still plenty of room for other companies and individual capitalists, all of whom will be welcome. Already 50 years ago, Krapf assigned the German people a leading role in the cultivation of Africa, let us not sit in a sulking corner! Now the way is clear and we must enter it with vigor. (Lively applause. Mr. Hamm, Senior Public Prosecutor, then explained the resolutions on behalf of the Board in a pithy and captivating manner. Gentlemen, the resolutions which the Central Board of the German Colonial Society has drafted with the representatives of the various departments gathered here from all over Germany after long and detailed debates, and which I would like to recommend to you for adoption, closely follow the important speeches which you have followed with such lively interest, Looking back on the successes of our Wißmann, which were a great honour to the German people and which Major Liebert described to us with such clarity and warmth, we would like to thank the Imperial Government and the Imperial Diet for the vigorous implementation of this great undertaking aimed at suppressing the slave trade and promoting culture in Africa. We are justly proud that Germany is leading all other European nations on the path to these lofty goals. Your Committee was united in this uplifting sentiment from the outset and you will all feel at one with us. We were not so quick to reach agreement in the Committee on the other resolutions concerning the Anglo-German agreement. We all agreed that this agreement not only significantly reduced the size of our African colonies, but also severely damaged the colonial possessions remaining in Africa and caused great difficulties for the development of our colonies in Africa in the future. However, we then disagreed, if not about the value of English friendship, which we had bought with these colonial sacrifices, then at least about whether the price paid for English friendship was not too high. In this respect, as between the two speakers, so also between us - I would say, according to temperament - the greatest differences of opinion became apparent. We finally agreed that, as a colonial society, we were not in a position to judge the value of the agreement for Germany from a general political point of view, nor, in the absence of any knowledge of the particular agreements, were we in a position to do so, and that, in saying this, we must confine ourselves to declaring the agreement to be highly disadvantageous to us, viewed solely from the point of view of Germany's colonial interests. At the present moment, however, not in contradiction, but precisely because of our unfavorable judgment of the agreement, we considered a double appeal necessary. Firstly, to the government: to save what can still be saved and to consolidate our remaining colonial possessions more and more and to open them up more and more to the economic and cultural work of German capital. And then to all of us: not to tire in our colonial endeavors, but to work all the more diligently and sustainably to awaken understanding and interest in our great colonial cause everywhere among the people and thus also the courage for extensive capital participation. If the agreement with England has brought us painful disappointments, let us therefore not accuse the government, but above all beat our own breast! Does the whole nation stand behind us in the colonial cause and has German capital so far participated with sustained vigor in the economic ventures in our colonies? As long as we friends of German colonial policy are still regarded by the masses as strange enthusiasts, as long as the whole German people have not come to realize that Germany, having joined the circle of the great European powers, has also received for its part the duty and honour of cooperating in the spread of Christian culture in the dark continent, as long as there is no general understanding of what is at stake for Germany's future if it is now excluded from all colonial possessions of value in the distribution of Africa among the European powers: for so long we cannot complain that the government does not conclude better colonial treaties. It must now be our task all the more to maintain the enjoyment of our German colonial possessions, which are still quite valuable and promising for a long future, but also require hard work.

colonies that we possess in Africa - and to spread this joy and patriotic enthusiasm for the development of our colonies to ever wider circles. We Germans have achieved the highest good there is for a people - a strong, unified nation state that is respected by foreign nations - only late, after centuries of toil and struggle. One of our first writers described this as a stroke of luck for the German people. He said: "God does not make the work towards this goal easy for the people, for whom he is well pleased, and does not allow them to reach the goal effortlessly, but makes the work more difficult for them and leads them to the goal the hard way. Perhaps it is the same with our colonial possessions. Perhaps it is fortunate for Germany that our first colonial successes, which we won relatively easily and effortlessly thanks to the daring of individual bold men, are not all claimed immediately, that we now have to acquire what we possess in colonies through hard, arduous work. It will be fortunate for Germany if we now show the same warm patriotism, the same vigorous determination and the same unshakeable confidence in success in the further development of our colonies as the man whose great successes in Africa we celebrate today with proud admiration. It is in this spirit that we have passed the resolutions which are now to be read out, and it is in this spirit that we ask you to adopt them unanimously. The resolutions read as follows: 1. the German Colonial Society thanks the Imperial Government and the Imperial Diet for the vigorous continuation of the undertakings aimed at combating the slave trade and promoting culture in Africa. 2. the German Colonial Society is not in a position to judge what reasons the Imperial Government had for concluding the agreement with England to delimit the spheres of interest of both sides in Africa, and does not consider itself qualified to pass judgment on that treaty from the standpoint of Imperial policy. On the other hand, as the appointed organ for the cultivation and propagation of the colonial idea among the German people, it expresses the conviction that the provisions of the agreement, insofar as they have come to public knowledge, have damaged the hopes placed in our colonial activities in Africa, and regrets that the ideal spirit that has awakened the colonial movement in Germany and made it a noteworthy factor in our public life has suffered a severe blow as a result. Although it recognizes that the secure demarcation of our protectorates has provided a basis for their development that should not be underestimated, it cannot exclude the view that this advantage, even taking into account the acquisition of Heligoland, has been purchased at disproportionate cost. (3) In view of this situation, the Assembly expresses the hope that the Imperial Government will now not only oppose with all its might any further impairment of German colonial interests, but will also take the further consolidation of our remaining colonial possessions into its own hands and thereby strengthen the courage of the people to participate vigorously in the economic development of the same. 4. the German Colonial Society considers it necessary to continue to promote German colonial interests and to support the economic and cultural development of our protectorates in word and deed. These resolutions were adopted unanimously, and after Minister of State v. Hofmann had made special reference in his closing speech to the national sentiment satisfied by the acquisition of Heligoland, he saluted the Kaiser, to which the assembly enthusiastically joined. The banquet. After the public meeting, more than 500 participants gathered in the afternoon for a banquet in the Palm Hall of the Flora. The background of the tables, at which the board of the Colonial Society and the Colonial Department of Cologne were seated with the guests of honor, was adorned with the imperial eagle and the Cologne coat of arms, framed by rich flag decorations. After the first course, Prince zu Wied stood up and celebrated our Emperor in roughly the following words: "The representatives of all the Gauen of Germany have flocked here to express their feelings, to celebrate Wißmann and to stand up for our beautiful young cause. What could be more natural than for us all to commemorate our youthful and energetic Emperor, who has just sailed out to the North Sea to visit friendly rulers. We see him, as he himself once told the Brandenburg Diet, on the gangplank of his ship, looking with justifiable pride at the ships that bear witness to Germany's greatness and power. We also see him in our mind's eye, standing on his ship's staircase under the starry sky, gazing thoughtfully into the future, towards the distant horizon, determined to seek the best for his country and his government, constantly looking up to the heavens. We see him going out to friendly rulers to sow trust and reap peace for his people. (Loud applause.) We trust our Emperor, we have only one thought towards him, the feeling of rock-solid trust for all the future, the feeling of unchanging love and loyalty. We express it by shouting: Long live His Majesty, our most gracious Emperor! The cry of homage resounded enthusiastically and "Heil dir im Siegeskranz" (Hail to thee in the wreath of victory) broke out in bright tones as Attorney General Hamm celebrated the hero to whom the celebration was dedicated. Wißmann did not want to have a drink. What is most likeable to us Germans is what adorns Wißmann: prudence, certainty and boldness in action and modesty. When Wißmann was here last year, he said it would be his greatest pride one day to have crossed Africa without having fired a shot, whereas another "Africa-crosser" had fired many shots. We had the satisfaction of knowing that the latter had had to pass through German territory in order to reach the coast. We were now celebrating the anniversary of the storming of Pangani, the first year of our colonial successes. Not everything we had hoped for had been achieved, but much more than we had expected from Major v. Wißmann, for which he deserved the thanks of the German people. (Lively applause. Major Liebert thanked Wißmann for the tribute and assured him that Wißmann was only prevented by illness, adding: "I still have more on my mind. Having glorified Wißmann's deeds this morning, I would like to remember two other German-Africans, Emin Pasha and We Germans are still a young Dr. Peters. (Loud applause.) Colonial people and have to learn everywhere in this direction. But one thing we always have is the right men in the right place. (Applause.) In this respect, no nation shall surpass us. (Loud applause.) I have had the honor of associating with Emin Pasha and have learned to respect and love him. I do not need to praise him. You know him and his works and his deeds, which he accomplished for 15 years at a difficult post. When the well-known Anglo-American publicity hero (stormy, prolonged applause), who became an explorer because he had unlimited means at his disposal, while Emin Pasha did not have such means in the least, seeks to insult Emin Pasha's character, the person concerned is judging himself in the eyes of right-thinking men. We Germans have a judgment as to whether the man is right who keeps his diaries honestly for 15 years and does not give them out into the world, but takes them back into Africa just because they do not seem polished enough to him, or the man who writes his travel reports beforehand. (Stormy applause.) The second person is Dr. Peters. It is said of him: "Confused by the parties' favor and hatred, his character fluctuates in history." (Lively applause.) It has not always been easy for us, his friends, to clear the stones out of his path, so much was thundered and railed at from all sides and he was maligned. Now we have reason to rejoice, for he has justified our trust in such a way that we can say: He is after all a thoughtful, a great man. Add to his deed that of the Anglo-American. With 12 soldiers and 40 porters, Dr. Peters overcame the most dreadful hardships. How many would have put down the lozenge and turned back. Read the wonderful letter he wrote from the interior of Africa. On his left flank he sees the mighty empire of Uganda, torn apart by factions. He enters the empire with a few soldiers, makes peace, concludes favorable treaties and returns to the coast. Only he did not think that these treaties

Page 182

 will no longer all be valid. That will not disparage him in our eyes. When Dr. Peters returns, we want to celebrate him as the great German, the great German-African. (Lively applause.) Both men, Emin Pasha and Dr. Peters, they live high In jubilant enthusiasm, the representatives of all German districts paid homage to the two heroes. Minister of State Dr. Hofmann, President of the Higher Regional Court Struckmann and others also spoke. In the evening, the gathering, multiplied by ladies and friends, flooded the brilliantly lit rooms of the Flora to the sound of festive music and the beautiful celebration ended in the most harmonious mood. German world = hegemony*) A voice in the desert. The Anglo-German treaty of June 1890 is undoubtedly new proof that our government is not striving to become a world naval and trading power. The treaty restricts our national "chauvinism" in this respect as firmly and thoroughly as possible for the foreseeable future. In Europe, England dominates the sea and world trade anyway, and where we have now secured colonial possessions in East and West Africa, we have left those places that dominate the sea and world trade there to the English (Walvis Bay) or only now ceded them to them (Zanzibar) But should we lament this? - I do not want to scold the "chauvinists" among us colonial politicians. I even agree with them that the question of world hegemony is increasingly shifting from the small field of European great-power competition to the more comprehensive field of overseas politics. But will sea power and world trade remain decisive for this? Will that nation exercise spiritual dominion over the globe which takes care of the business of packers, the accounting and the police services, or rather that which solves the cultural tasks of mankind and to this end allows itself to be supported by friendly nations in the packers' and police services I have often taken the opportunity to point out the desirability of our close union with the British Empire; now this seems to me more necessary than ever. We should not look at the differences that separate us from our fellow tribesmen, but at what unites us with them in a common culture. It is not the treaty with England that I find reason to lament, but rather the despondent, pessimistic mood that is currently making itself felt in our colonial circles. For this shows how narrow and petty the minds of some of our friends and comrades still are. Let them broaden their cultural horizons a little and rise above the church tower horizon of mischievous nationalism. May everyone take to heart what the Parisian astronomer Flammarion recently said in his witty essay "L'oeil nouveau": "On one of the smallest of the countless waves, on a speck of boundless space, with a horizon as narrow as the shell of a caterpillar, we live, creatures of a moment, knowing nothing, seeing nothing, and yet imagining that we know and control nature. Yes! to the astronomer it must seem desirable that the heads of nations, the legislators and statesmen, should look at the map of the heavens and put themselves in a position to understand it. This calm contemplation would probably be more useful to mankind than many congresses and parliamentary speeches. If we knew how small our earth is, perhaps we would stop tearing it to shreds! Peace would then reign in the world, social prosperity would take the place of pernicious militarism, and the political enmity of nations would cease. - But many a secret of heaven will be revealed to the photographic eye before man's eye will see wisdom in the council of nations. Of course, this view does not release us from our duty to do our utmost to ensure and work for the prosperity of our national culture. But let us look at the English treaty from this somewhat higher point of view than the one we have today! Have we secured our national future more through this treaty? The following thoughts of Dr. Hübbe=Schleiden will come as a surprise to some readers and challenge his criticism, but we believe that they deserve consideration as coming from one of our first colonial politicians, even if one does not want to accept the premises. D. R.
damaged - or more secure? - It seems to me the latter! - Did our salvation ever lie in a struggle with England for power in maritime affairs and world trade? - Never! Have we not always used England's power to our advantage in both respects? Have not our Hanseatic merchants always succeeded masterfully in this? Did we not achieve significant successes at the World Exhibition in Australia? - Should we not also be able to let England carry the burden of many advantages for us in Zanzibar? And can it be a question of the external organization of world trade for the intellectual cultural predominance among nations? - Certainly not! Only decisive cultural achievements of lasting value can justify such world hegemony. The cultural task, however, to which the German people are called more than any other among mankind (apart from philosophy, science and internal organization), is not world trade, not naval power, but the solution of the most difficult, most far-reaching and at the same time most economically profitable cultural question, the cultivation of primitive peoples and natural countries. England has not yet proved equal to this task. But our closest relatives, the Dutch, achieved great things in this cultural work two centuries ago. Wißmann's brilliant successes, among others, have again proven that we Germans, with our great organizational talent and as much patience as we have grit, can achieve more than other peoples at the right time, even with few resources. But how we could turn our East Africa into a German Ethiopia in the sense I have already expressed my opinion on this in the 1887 volume of the "Kolonialzeitung" in the essays on the "treaty system". Once the fulfillment of this task has been approached, more qualified people will soon come forward with better proposals; and the right man will certainly be found at the right time to carry them out! This new treaty with England points us once again in the handiest way to our most important world task: the cultural education of primitive peoples. In East Africa, the consolidation of our rule offers us essential advantages for the realization of this cultural task. We will at least gain the prospect of being able to dominate our territory more completely than before, including the coast. The acquisition of Heligoland may or may not have any other advantages for Germany, but for our colonial endeavors it has the value of making even the most stupid German philistine aware of the national benefits of overseas politics. Let us exploit this advantage for our cultural task! Only if this treaty were not utilized in the right way, here at home and especially abroad, would it mean a step backwards for us in our national development; but not in such a way that we would have been damaged by it in our cultural development, but only in such a way that it would become a lasting testimony to the practical incapacity of our national intellectual power. I do not fear this at all! But only cultural achievements of lasting value to mankind will lead to world hegemony among its races and peoples. Hübbe=Schleiden. In darkest Africa. The civilized world has just come into possession of a great work by the famous traveller for the fourth time, and the reviews of it have already taken up a great deal of space in the daily newspapers, which could not tire of admiring the stupendous achievement of the journey, and of presenting to their readers once again in the fullest detail what had already become known through the reports published earlier. We can refrain from doing so. It is certain that the march through the Congo Forest is an outstanding achievement, but it is equally certain that this expedition will conclude the series of great expeditions. For the loss of human life was so immense that no civilized state will ever again bear the responsibility of delivering its subjects, even if they belonged to a contemptible class of Zanzibarites, to such an enterprise. As an excuse, however, it should be said that Stanley had a humanitarian purpose in mind, which he endeavored to carry out by all means, but one will become aware of this when reading the incidentally *) In Darkest Africa. Search, Rescue and Retreat of Emin Pasha, Governor of the Aquatorial Province. By H. M. Stauley. 2 volumes. Leipzig. F. A. Brockhaus.

Page 183

In this exciting, if occasionally verbose, book, I cannot help thinking that Stanley chose the Congo route primarily because the area he was traveling through was still completely unknown. The route he proposed for the return march could just as well have been chosen on the outward march, since there were no serious reasons for not doing so; incidentally, it is the same route that Wissmann proposed at the time when the rebellion broke out in East Africa. With his huge caravan, he would certainly not only have been able to protect the Christian missions in Uganda, but also perhaps help Emin Pasha to the extent that the Aquatorial Province was preserved for culture, whereas it has now been handed over to the Mahdists as a result of insufficient assistance. Just consider that both the caravans starting from Mombas and Dr. Peters, who chose the incomparably more difficult, completely unknown Tanaroute, succeeded in reaching Emin Pasha's station with incomparably fewer means and the loss of little human material, and you will then realize that Stanley, despite his not undoubtedly humanitarian approach, is not undeserving of reproach for such an experienced African traveller as he is. But as far as the ultimate humanitarian purpose is concerned, which alone can reconcile the unprecedented loss of human life in the history of African exploration, the whole world agrees today that Stanley basically cared very little for Emin Pasha, but had more political purposes in mind. But when he saw that his diplomacy was shipwrecked before Emin Pasha, that the latter was not to be had either for King Leopold or for England, he brought out a very uncomfortable side of his nature, intent only on leading the reluctant Emin Pasha away from Aquatoria by gentle force. The more he realized that Emin Pasha did not want to be harnessed to his triumphal chariot, the more he finally became a completely indifferent personality, although he was occasionally unable to escape the charm of his personality, just like Jephson, who is therefore occasionally called the "Eminist". Emin Pasha had rejected the proposals of a political nature that Stanley made to him and declared his willingness to go along if his people did. Accompanying Stanley to the Victoria Nyanza was the best and by far the most sensible solution to the problem. Although Stanley reproached the Pasha even then for not having waited for him, he nevertheless wrote by far the best characterization of Emin in his diary that day, no doubt still under the impression of the conversation and the hope that Emin would soon accompany him. "His abilities, efficiency and usefulness for the peculiar position in which he was placed are evident from the way in which he made it possible to clothe his troops. Among the presents imposed upon us were pieces of cotton cloth woven by his own men, coarse but strong, as well as slippers and shoes made by his own shoemaker. The appearance of his steamers and boats after long service, the preparation of oil suitable for the engines, a mixture of sesame oil and tallow, the excellent sanitary facilities, the cleanliness and orderliness of the stations under his command, the regular payment of the grain tribute twice a year by his Negro sub-dauen without objection, all serve to mark his peculiar character and to prove that he possesses talents rarely found in those who choose Africa as their field of labor. In endeavoring to judge him, I pass in my mind's eye hundreds of Oifizieren who have served on the Nile and Congo, but I know few who would equal him in any of his valuable qualities. Apart from his linguistic knowledge, he is a naturalist, somewhat of a botanist, and as for him as a doctor, I believe that 20-30 years of the adventurous life he led gave him rare opportunities to become wise and skillful in this profession. The words he used give out more than what is necessary for a general conversation, and also made me recognize his fluency in English, which sounded very pleasant in his sonorous voice and measured manner of speaking, notwithstanding the foreign accent. I found him very well informed on the questions of politics discussed in newspapers and magazines, no matter what country we were talking about. His manner is very courteous and obliging, perhaps a little too ceremonious for Central Africa, but most befitting a governor, and just such as might be expected from an official in such a position, conscious of his grave responsibilities. Hard work seems to be an important necessity of life for him. He is a model of hard, patient work. No sooner had he set up camp than he set about methodically tidying up the furniture. His table and chair have their designated places, the diaries are on the table, the aneroid barometers are on a suitable pedestal, and the thermometers and pspchrometers are properly placed in the shade so that the air can brush them properly. The diaries are marvels of delicacy and without blots, the writing is microscopically small, as if he wanted to win a prize for accuracy, economy, delicacy and fidelity." But this favorable mood did not last long. The rebellion thwarted Emin Pasha's and Stanley's orders; while Stanley tried with all his might to get out of the country, for which he had not the slightest interest, Emin, who had grown fond of the country and its inhabitants, hesitated to leave in a manner quite incomprehensible to Stanley. The reasons are highly honorable to Emin. No sharper contrast can be imagined than between the natures of Stanley and Emin. Just read the following passage from the diary, dated March 1, 1889, where the expression "angular in character" would probably bring a smile to any reader who can form an idea of Stanley's nature. As a naturalist and meteorologist, the Pasha was in his own element. He belonged to the school of Schweinfurth and Holub; his love of science borders on fanaticism. During our daily chats I tried to find out whether he was a Christian. Muslim, Jew or pagan, and I almost suspect that he is nothing more than a materialist. Who can tell why disciples of science, though exceedingly amiable in social intercourse, are so angular in character? After my analysis of their nature, when I compare it with the character of people who are more Christians than scholars, I must associate with it a certain hardness, or rather want of delicacy. Their nature seems to me somewhat unsympathetic, capable only of cool friendship, and coldly indifferent to warmer human feelings. I can best express what I mean when I say that, in my opinion, they have more love for the bleached skull or the ugly skeleton of a man than for what is divine in the human being. When someone speaks of the inner beauty which some consider alone worthy of attention, they are inclined to yawn and reply with an apologetic, pitying smile. They seem to want to imply that they have studied the whole body through and through and that it would only be a waste of time to dwell on something that only exists in the imagination. These few sentences speak louder than long treatises; they show the sharp contrast between the explorer who sees the goal to be striven for in reaching a point and its approximate cartographic definition, and the collecting explorer who does not lose sight of even the smallest details and who conquers his world from within. Stanley is tasteless enough to repeatedly allude to Emin's scientific importance, but sometimes it comes over him like a realization and a tone of warmer feeling breaks through, for example in the following words from the chapter "Emin Pasha, a Study": "The virtues and noble aspirations for which we must praise the man in the strictest justice are just as great and praiseworthy for him as those which we cannot ascribe to him. Every man who strives for the sake of good, to kdun what is in him to deserve the sweet approbation of conscience, is armed with a happy indifference to all the rest; therein lies the merit of Pasha, and it was this which made his society so agreeable to us, when the necessity of violent action ceased to vex him. We have learned more of his character by his nature than by words. The melancholy shake of his head, the raising of his hand, the calm, measured seriousness of his features, the opening of his eyes and the unassuming shrug of his shoulders seemed to say to us: "What's the use? You see, I am resigned. I am an enemy of violence, refrain from it. Why force them? Surely you should have seen during these many years that I have only your best interests at heart. If they don't want me, should I impose myself and my ideas on them against their will?" He never admitted as much, but we were free to explain the somptoms to ourselves according to a lower opinion. Probably the fact that he devoted himself constantly and lovingly to certain pursuits aimed at the expansion of science and his weakened eyesight made him unfit to perform the more serious duties which, as it seemed to us, the circumstances of his sphere of activity demanded. But he cannot be blamed for giving more importance to scientific studies than to the duties of government, or for his taste which made him value the title of Doctor Modicinno more than the rank of Pasha, or for running the risk of losing his sight altogether in a cataract. If he had to hold a book in front of his eyes in order to be able to read, it was physically impossible for him to read a person's mood from his face and to judge whether his gaze reflected anger or loyalty. But whatever opinion we may have had about what should have happened, we always had a high regard for him. One cannot but admire him when one sees how, at a moment when his own fate is in the balance, he uses every opportunity to increase his stock of sea-shells and trovic plants, how he eagerly seeks the possession of a rare bird without regard to its color and beauty, and with the same interest examines a new species of rat, how he takes the measurements of a human skull When a large evening butterfly, a rare cheese or a typhloy is brought to him, he immediately forgets the court-martial that is to pass judgment on him, and he seems to be completely indifferent as to whether he is to be shot by his soldiers or delivered to the Khalif of Chartum as booty, strapped to his cot. When one hears all this and begins to understand him, one realizes, though one may wonder at these sideways crickets of human nature, that the man is worthy of any sacrifice on our part. If Stanley, even in quiet moments, Emin Pasha's nature

Page 184

 can hardly understand, although he is immensely overconfident in his knowledge of human nature, he can do so least of all when he becomes agitated, passionate and bitter. He has no idea that his behavior towards Emin provokes at least as sharp a criticism as Emin's alleged weakness and indecisiveness, which is certainly due to the general, morbid irritability that afflicts everyone living in Africa after a more or less long stay. Europeans who have lived in Africa for many years are no longer accustomed to being approached, least of all by a swaggering benefactor with rude manners, who sometimes plays the prophet, sometimes providence, and is not a little vain about it. So far we have only Stanley's one-sided view of the causes of Emin's hesitation, and it would therefore be highly desirable for Emin to publish his diaries now so that the world can get a different picture of the situation at that time. They will probably not be able to tell us much new about Stanley himself; his character is now generally appreciated in the right way. Great as a traveler because of his tenacity of purpose, small as a man. But one cannot separate the two, and therefore reading the book does not make a very pleasant impression. One can only advise the publishers to combine the two volumes into one as quickly as possible, eliminating the grotesque additions, and thus make the travelogue enjoyable for a wider audience, because, as already mentioned, it contains many characteristic and geographically significant details. Small notes. - (The Colonial Department.) The department formed in the Foreign Office on April 1 of this year will henceforth bear the name "Colonial Department" in accordance with a decree issued by the Imperial Chancellor on June 29; following the leave of absence of Privy Legation Councillor Dr. Krauel, who has been appointed to a diplomatic post, its management has been transferred to Privy Legation Councillor Dr. Kayser as departmental director. As far as relations with foreign states and general policy are concerned, the Colonial Department remains under the authority of the State Secretary of the Foreign Office. In all actual colonial matters, however, especially in all organizational questions, the Colonial Department will in future function independently under the responsibility of the Imperial Chancellor in such a way that the head of the department will make the necessary presentations directly to the supreme head of the Imperial administration and will himself designate the documents to be issued by the latter under the designation "Foreign Office, Colonial Department". - We have every reason to be satisfied with the change both in the organization and in the leading personalities. - (The German-English agreement), which was signed on July 2, is attracting even more public attention in England than in Germany. In the House of Commons, on July 3, the Anglo-German agreement on Africa and the cession of Heligoland to Germany again gave rise to various interpellations to the Government, which, however, on the whole, were repetitions of previous questions. Sir James Fergusson, the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, promised the early production of the official documents relating to the negotiations preceding the treaty with Germany, and in reply to a question from Waddy he declared that the treaty between the German Empire and Great Britain was concluded entirely in accordance with constitutional custom. The First Lord of the Treasury, Smith, in answer to a question from Sommer, stated that the Governor of Heligoland was in England during the negotiations for the cession of the island to Germany. Fergusson also stated that the German government was prepared to recognize legally acquired concessions in Damaraland. In the case of Lewis, however, the validity of the main concession was disputed by the German government, and the matter in question was still under consideration. At the meeting on July 7, the First Lord of the Treasury, Smith, explained that the southern boundary of the Walsischbai area was unfortunately not precisely defined, and that discussions had therefore arisen between the Cape authorities and the German authorities in Damaraland as to whether a certain stretch of land, which appeared important as a water station for the roads from the coast to Jnland, should be included in the boundary of the Walsischbai area.*) An attempt to settle the existing differences of opinion through a joint commission had failed. As the English and German commissioners had not reached agreement, the English-German agreement contained provisions to submit the matter to arbitration. - The House of Lords passed the Heligoland Consent Bill at first reading. - Some Members of Parliament are making great efforts to obtain still more in East Africa for the English Government, especially since it appears that France has demanded compensation, whether on the Riger or in Madagascar, for consenting to the assumption of the English protectorate over Zanziba. The matter has a certain importance for us, because it may lead to the hinterland of our Togo colony coming into French possession. The cession of the island of Masla), the third largest of the sultanates belonging to the Sultanate of Zanzibar, to the French, is a matter of some importance because it could possibly lead to the cession of the hinterland of our Togo colony.
The Sultanate of Zanzibar seems to be the most that our diplomacy was able to achieve before England. When the main features of the agreement with England had become known and it had immediately become apparent that a comparison of the German text with the English text revealed many points of contention, the societies interested in East Africa had made every effort to ensure that at least Pemba or Masia would be ceded to Germany. Pemba is the richer of the two, which in and of themselves are quite unhealthy, as they have many swamps and low places, veritable breeding grounds for miasma. Moreover, they have no harbors, no towns or any significant settlements and are difficult to navigate because of the coral reefs. But the vegetation here is, where possible, even more luxuriant than on Zanzibar itself, which, as the planters have discovered to their detriment, has little good soil for growing tobacco and coffee. Masia was always a particularly popular staging post for slave traders, and the English blue books often tell of dangerous expeditions by marines. The protectorate over Masia will also provide us with many experiences in this respect. The location of the island in relation to the coast and its harbors is less favorable than that of Zanzibar and Pemba, but the island, which to a certain extent covers the south, is certainly of value for later. (The representatives of all the powers, with the exception of the Netherlands, signed the General Act of the Anti-Slavery Conference and an additional declaration concerning the Congo tariffs on July 2. The Dutch Government has been granted six months to declare its adherence to the resolutions of the Conference. - We will come back to the General Act of the Conference in more detail. (From East Africa.) The "Reichsanzeiger" carried the following announcement in its unofficial section: "The suspicions that have often appeared in the press that the realization of the German-English agreement will harm the German-East African Society are incorrect. As soon as the sovereignty of the Sultan of Zanzibar over the coastline and the island of Masia is transferred to the German Empire, the Society will have the task of colonizing the area unhindered by foreign influence. The government, which must not regard it as its duty to initiate and manage economic ventures, attaches importance to the East African Company, which has already begun to develop its facilities for trade and agriculture on the coast, not only maintaining them but also expanding them as far as possible. The government will support the company in these relations to the best of its ability." - The Arader Mohamed Kaisim, who murdered the German merchant Giesecke in the vicinity of Tabora in 1886, was court-martialed by the deputy Reichskommissar for East Africa and sentenced to death. - The Jrlander Stokes, who has entered German service, is to set off for Unvamwest in mid-July with a 2000-strong expedition, which will be accompanied by a German officer. - According to the latest reports, Dr. Peters was in Usagara. - The Missions- und Heidenbote, the organ of the Neukirchner Missionsgesellschaft, declares that the mission, although Witu has been placed under English protection, will not cease to work among the Pokomo even under the changed circumstances. - The chief Mandara of Moschi has, as Mr. Ehlers, who was still in Sanstbar at the beginning of June, from where he wanted to leave for India and New Guinea, writes to us, abolished slavery in his country. - (Germany, wake up!) Under this title, an appeal has gone through the press, signed by Dr. A. Fick, Zurich, (who is known to the readers of the Kolonialzeitung through his earlier work in it), in which an appeal is made to appeal to the German Reichstag in mass petitions, and to speak out frankly that the German-English treaty has awakened bright despair in thousands. The concluding sentences of the appeal read: "Who can prevent a nation of 50 million, which devotes its greatest strength to military service, which spends over half a billion a year on warfare, who can prevent such a nation from tearing up a treaty which is obviously intended to defraud future generations of their inheritance in the plancten?! Truly, our sacrifices of blood and money would be too great if our military power did not even give us the opportunity to assert our good right even where it does not meet with the high approval of the English. We are prepared to fall in line at the call of our Emperor and to be led silently and obediently towards the enemy's bullets, but we can also demand a price worth the sacrifice, and that price is: to belong to a master nation that takes its share of the world for itself and does not seek to receive it from the mercy and goodwill of another nation. (From South West Africa.) Dr. Goering, the Reichskommissar for South West Africa, issued two decrees in Usap on March 25 and April 1, according to which the import and trade in weapons and ammunition, as well as the trade in spirits, is only permitted against liquor vouchers. Violations are punished in the former hall with fines of up to 1000 marks, in the latter case with fines of up to 500 marks. - Captain v. François has already set off on his aforementioned expedition to the Ngamiiee in January with 3 men from the Schutztruppe, 2 Bastards. 4 Berg=Damara and 3 Namas. - Lieutenant v. François had set off for Otvimbinque on March 5 with 42 companions, then marched to Okabandya, and was received by Mabarero in a friendly manner.Captain v. Francois intended to travel to the eastern Damara district with the troop at the beginning of July with a strength of 2 officers, 38 men and 6 wagons.

To the members of the German Colonial Society. After the Annual General Meeting of the German Colonial Society took place in Cologne on June 30 and July 1 in the most satisfactory manner, I cannot but take this opportunity to express my deep regret to all members of our Society that I was prevented from attending it by a sudden indisposition from which I suffered for several weeks. As much as I regretted this, on the other hand, I am very pleased to note from the reports on the negotiations that there was a pleasing consensus of opinion on most of the important issues discussed. This is certainly due to the efforts on all sides to achieve the greatest possible unity in the work to which our Society is dedicated. I would particularly like to emphasize that the proposed amendments to our statutes were so readily accepted by the departments. I am convinced that their adoption will bring about a correct organization of the relationship between the departments and the central management. As urgently as I would like to see a lively, fresh life animating the departments at all times, and for them to frequently take the initiative for new tasks, it is nevertheless necessary, on the other hand, to maintain the unity of the management in all important matters in order to achieve great results, that the amendment to the statutes has found the right expression for the mutual behavior of the central body and the departments, the letter of the statutes alone cannot provide a sure guarantee of this if not all members of our society are inspired by the spirit of unity. In the Cologne meeting, however, this spirit prevailed in such a convincing manner that I have the joyful confidence that all differences of opinion will continue to find a peaceful balance in the bosom of the Society in the future. A not insignificant difficulty for the Cologne Assembly lay in the assessment of the German-English agreement. It was not possible to remain silent on this treaty, which was highly significant for the future development of the colonial issue; a position had to be taken on it. As different as the opinions on this matter seem to have been, thanks to the efforts of insightful and patriotic men, it was possible to give expression to the feelings of colonial society, which met with general approval. I can declare myself in complete agreement with the content of the resolution adopted, especially as it expresses, in a way that should not be misunderstood, the regret that the hopes we justifiably cherished with regard to the demarcation of German protectorates could not be fulfilled. We are not in a position to judge the reasons which prompted the Imperial Government to accommodate the British wishes to such an extent without having an overview of the entire political situation. Now that the treaty has been concluded and there can be no doubt that both the English Parliament and the German Reichstag will give their consent to it, insofar as these legislative factors are constitutionally entitled to do so, we must ask ourselves what attitude our society should adopt in future. It is certainly not our task to indulge in impotent lamentation, to regret what has been lost and to stand by and watch the further development of our colonial policy. As painful as it must be for all of us to have to give up so many cherished hopes, we must keep in mind that vast areas in East and West Africa are awaiting German cultural work and that we must not casually lay our hands in our laps. On the contrary, we must use all our energy to fulfill the task that has been set for Germany. We must prove to the world, and especially to the British, that the German nation is capable, even under unfavourable conditions, of fulfilling the great civilizing task we have undertaken by participating in the colonization of overseas territories. We must not expose ourselves to the ridicule of our neighboring nations by discouragingly throwing in the towel because only part of what we wanted has been fulfilled. Now it is a matter of leading the African territories firmly assigned to us towards culture. In order to do this successfully, it is above all necessary for us to gain a precise knowledge of the countries. As yet, we have very little information about large areas of both East and West Africa that are under German patronage. We must investigate the most suitable transport links, determine the navigability of the rivers, the construction of roads, and find out where fixed stations should be built to serve as bases for larger settlements. It will be the task of our society, in agreement with the colonial commercial companies involved, to effectively prepare and promote the economic development and cultural development of these countries and the settlement of German emigrants in suitable places by sending special expeditions to the as yet unexplored parts of the German protectorates and areas of interest. A more lively

The participation of the public in our society and a reduction in expenditure on the press could enable us to do justice to this practical work of colonization. However, this is not to say that the other tasks of our society should be completely set aside. The production of good maps of our protected areas that can be used by the general public, as has already been done to some extent in recent years, certainly contributes to a better knowledge of them and should be continued in the future. The work of the information office for emigrants should not be restricted. In time, if our efforts succeed in bringing about a legal regulation of emigration, they will be of considerable benefit to the great mass of emigrants. Knowledge of the countries most suitable for German emigrants is becoming ever more extensive and reliable as a result of the numerous reports coming in and the study of the overseas territories concerned, on the basis of which reliable advice can be given to emigrants. I do not wish to abandon the idea, which has found healthy expression in our statutes, that our society should form the focal point for all colonial endeavors. I can state with satisfaction that almost all those who have wanted to embark on a colonial venture have first and foremost turned to our Society for advice or support. If we have not always been able to give those involved the answers they hoped for, the reason has often been that we have been approached with overly adventurous plans, but often also because of the novelty and inexperience with which we naturally have to contend. Our main task now, however, will always have to be to direct our energies as far as possible towards the practical colonization of our protected areas. However, this will only be possible if we enjoy the strongest possible support from the Reich government and the Reichstag. The state security of the territories assigned to us and the guarantee that the Reich will ensure legality and order give us hope that capital will participate more generously in the implementation of a suitable colonization of the vast stretches of land. I believe that I have demonstrated in the foregoing that the Colonial Society has a rich field of activity open to it even under the present circumstances, and I would be pleased if my views could, on the whole, meet with the approval of the honorable members of our Society. Prince of Hohenlohe=Langenburg. From the German Emin Pasha expedition. On July 18, Dr. Peters and Lieutenant v. Tiedemann arrived in Zanzibar in good health and we will perhaps soon be in a position to report on the expedition's last marches. As soon as the first news of Dr. Peters' arrival on the coast became available, the German Colonial Society sent the following telegraphic congratulations to the courageous traveler: Warmest congratulations to the bold champion of civilization on his happy return from a difficult and brilliantly executed expedition. Colonial Society. Hohenlohe. Annual general meeting in Cologne. We still have a few things to add to the report in No. 15 of the newspaper. Following the annual report, the secretary of the Cologne Chamber of Commerce, Dr. R. van der Borght, drew attention to the grievances brought about by the Royal Niger Company's violation of the Congo Act on the Niger, as well as to the Hönigsberg case, about which the German government has lodged a complaint with the British government; at the same time, a written interpellation was submitted to the Executive Board, which reads as follows: Is the Board aware of what steps have recently been taken by the Imperial Government against the continued violation of the Niger Navigation Act of February 26, 1885, by the Royal Niger Company, and what success have these steps had? 2 Is there any truth in the rumor which has recently appeared in the public papers that the freedom of trade and navigation on the Niger is to be abandoned in favor of England? What knowledge does the Board have of the present state of affairs of the merchant Hönigsberg, and is there any prospect that the aforementioned will be granted adequate compensation for the damage suffered in the shortest possible time? In reply to the interpellation, the Secretary General, Dr. Bolemeyer, pointed out that the matter had been clarified by the declarations of the German government in the Reichstag of October 1189 and that a satisfactory outcome was to be expected thereafter through full recognition of the German complaints on the part of England; England's reply was still pending and Redner referred to the information in the annual report (pp. 13-15) on the case, or to the diplomatic correspondence in the White Paper, seventh part, so that it was possible to refrain from entering into a more detailed discussion of the interpellation. In October of last year, the German government sent a note to the British embassy in London stating that it considered the abuses on the Riger to be proven facts and hoped that the Royal British Government would not hesitate any longer to intervene. The German government has also expressly recognized the legality of the compensation to be granted to the merchant Hönigsberg in the note in question; it states in the relevant passage: "The compensation to be granted to the merchant Hönigsberg according to the opinion of the Imperial Commissioner falls short of his demands by more than half and is, in the opinion of my high government, to be regarded as low and modest. An early correction of the same would therefore only be in accordance with the dictates of justice. After this decisive statement of the German government on the matter, it could be expected from the English government that 1. the customs blockade and the violence of the Royal Riger Company against the provisions of the Niger Shipping Act would now be quickly removed and 2. Kaufmann Hönigsberg would immediately be satisfied at least to the extent of the compensation demanded by the German government, which was considered low and modest; the sum demanded by the government amounted to about 6143 Lstrl. This expectation was held above all in colonial circles, which had paid particular attention to the matter from the outset, and this was still the view held by the Colonial Society at the time of the Annual General Meeting. Unfortunately, in the meantime and in the course of writing this report, it has now become apparent, through the reply from England to the above-mentioned Red, that the matter has entered a completely new, highly surprising stage. Although we only know the part of the reply that relates to the demands from the Hönigsberg case, this is sufficient to abandon all hope of restoring freedom of navigation on the Riger as useless. After the English government had already offered Hönigsberg some time ago that he could return to the Riger (he had been expelled from the country by the "Company") and trade freely if he waived monetary compensation from the Royal Niger Company, and this offer had been rejected by the injured party with the consent of the German government, the English government has now recently declared itself willing to pay monetary compensation in the amount of 500 pounds or approx. 8 percent of the low and modest claim of the German government in addition to the earlier offer of free return. This notification was sent to the merchant Hönigsberg in writing by the Foreign Office in Berlin on July 14 of this year, with the addition that he would like to contact the Royal Niger Company directly regarding this offer. The latter remark could easily lead to the conclusion that this case of complaint should not be regarded as a matter for the governments, but we consider this to be out of the question, because we believe that the German citizen is also protected by his home government vis-à-vis England. An explanation for the English Government's conduct, which deviates so far from all expectations, can only be found in its parliamentary system; all the statements made so far in the matter on the English side clearly show that the English Government, contrary to the German Government, does not follow the free resolution, is not guided solely by factual considerations, but by the fact that the English Government has not acted in accordance with the German Government's wishes.

Page 187
 
but that it is under the pressure exerted on it by the influential and powerful circles close to the management of the Royal Niger Company. Reasons of continental policy may not permit the German Government to give any other emphasis to its complaints against the insolence of the English Company than by sending a commissioner, who finds the complaints justified, and by exchanging a few notes. It would appear that the German government is counting on a concession from England. But when one considers that Hönigoberg's debts from his ruin caused by the Royal Riger Company amount to over 100,000 marks and that he must now live on the mercy of his friends who support him in his misfortune, all things known to the English government, then after the insulting offer of 500 Lstrl. After the insulting offer of 500 Lstrl, there is no further proof that the prestige of German trade must be independent of English good will. From the Hönigsberg complaint, the outcome of which cannot be determined with any degree of certainty, one can also conclude with a fair degree of certainty that Germany will be lenient in the matter of shipping and trade on the Riger; in any case, it would be foolish to hope otherwise. Nothing has changed in the present state of violence and violation of the law on the Niger, since the Riger Company knows quite well that no one will take it seriously enough to put a stop to it by more solid than paper means, and its own government is powerless to do anything else than it wants. And since this situation is possible today, despite the fact that the international Congo Act guarantees free navigation and free trade on the Niger, no change can be expected as soon as the freedom from customs duties on the Congo, as sought by the signature powers of the Congo Act with the exception of Holland, is abolished. This would make legal on the Niger precisely what we are still fighting against, albeit in vain. With painful feelings, we give up hope that free access to the hinterland of Cameroon on the Niger and Benns will be secured for us in the future, just as we do not share the view that this should not be a great loss for us, because we still have access from the land side, from the coast of Cameroon to the interior, which meets the current needs of German interests on the coast. We felt that we owed our members these few remarks following the interpellation communicated, and now continue with the supplementary report on the Annual General Meeting. The following gentlemen have been unanimously re-elected as representatives to audit the accounts for the current year: bank director Consul Wallich, banker Natorp, merchant Kistenmacher, Dr. Pfaff, chemist, art publisher Grunert. The amendments to the Articles of Association proposed by the Board of Directors, as published in No. 13 of the Deutsche Kolonialzeitung, were adopted with very minor deviations. The motion of the Munich Division underh was withdrawn in favor of the motion of the Hanover Division under g; the other motions under a to g were unanimously adopted with a few editorial changes decided by the Board of Directors at the meeting on June 30. As a result of these amendments, the Articles of Association have become substantially different in individual sections, so that we are printing them as they now stand in a separate supplement. The adopted amendments are highlighted in print. After the motion (under s) to increase the number of members of the Board of Directors to be elected by the Annual General Meeting from 25 to 50 had been adopted, the Chairman read out the list of nominations, which was recommended to the Annual General Meeting by the Board of Directors for adoption and contains 26 names instead of 25, as a new election was to be held in Berlin for Director Cornelius, who resigned in March of this year. At the request of Mr. Baumann (Frankfurt am Main), the following 26 gentlemen were unanimously elected to the Board of Directors by acclamation in accordance with the proposal of the Board of Directors: Government Assessor Angerer, Potsdam; Prince von Arenberg, Knight Commander à la suito of the army and retired Legation Secretary, Berlin; Consul General of the Argentine Republic H. Alb. de Bary, Antwerp; retired State Councillor Fritzen, Düsseldorf; Andr. von Grand Ry, owner of a manor and member of the Reichstag, Eupen b. Koblenz; Imperial Count and Marquis von und zu Hoensbroech, hereditary marshal in the Duchy of Geldern, Haag Castle near Geldern; Count von Hompesch, royal chamberlain and owner of a manor, Rurich Castle near Cörrenzig; Count Hahn=Neuhaus, chamberlain of Her Royal Highness Princess Heinrich of Prussia, Darmstadt; Chief Postmaster Heindorf, Frankfurt a. d. O.; former Reichstag deputy Major, Baron von Hoiningen=Huene, Berlin; Senior Public Prosecutor Hamm, Member of the State Council, Cologne; Privy Councillor of Commerce A. von Heimendahl, Krefeld; Former District Administrator Janßen, Burtscheid near Aachen. Janßen, Burtscheid near Aachen; Prince Karl Fugger=Babenhausen, Augsburg; Regierungsrat von Knebel=Doeberitz, Berlin; Wirklicher Geheimer Rat von Kusserow, Excellency, Hamburg; Major Liebert, Berlin; Professor Maenß, Magdeburg; Director Dr. Mehnert, Dresden; Reichstag deputy, lawyer and consistorial councillor Dr. jur. Porsch, Breslau; Professor Dr. Supan, Gotha; Wirkliter Geheimer Ober=Justizrat Dr. Struckmann, Cologne; Royal President of the Senate at the Higher Regional Court Dr. Ritter von Staudinger, Munich; Privy Councillor of Commerce and Reichstag Deputy G. Siegle, Stuttgart; Lieutenant Colonel (ret.) Uhl, Bamberg; President of the Chamber of Commerce Zaun, Minden i. W. Of the speeches given at the Annual General Meeting, the earlier report contains the wording of that given by Ministerial Director Sachse, who for the first time gave a clear overview of the postal and telegraph facilities that have been set up in our protected areas. For this reason, we can refrain from reproducing verbatim the highly interesting lecture by Dr. Friedrichs, which will probably be published in a legal journal or as a special brochure, but we will complete the information on Dr. Hindorf's lecture on New Guinea later. After the Chairman had proposed Nuremberg as the venue for the next Annual General Meeting and this proposal had been approved with the proviso that, should it be necessary, the Board could, at its own discretion, determine a different venue, the meeting of the Annual General Meeting was closed. Dr. Bokemeyer, Secretary General. The public meeting and the banquet on July 1 were exhaustively reported in No. 13 of the newspaper, but we would like to add a few characteristic toasts. Mr. Hamm, Senior Public Prosecutor, celebrated Major v. Wißmann in the following words: "Gentlemen! In ancient Rome, triumphs were granted to military leaders who returned home victorious from battles with foreign peoples. Despite all our pleas, our German victor returning from Africa did not attend the celebration that we organized here without triumph in the simplest manner. This is a characteristic trait for our Wißmann, who, in the German heroic manner, knows better how to fight for victories than to boast about them. When Wißmann took part in the first anti-slavery meeting in the Gürzenich in 1888, before his so glorious and successful expedition in East Africa, and we talked to him about his famous African journeys, he said that he did not consider it a glory that he had crossed Africa twice, but that he had done so without firing a shot. Now, with arms in hand, Wißmann, as commander of the German Empire, has put down the rebellion in East Africa, suppressed the slave trade on the coast and far into the interior, and opened the way for literary culture into the heart of the German continent. These very days are the anniversary of his heroic storming of Pangani. But even here, where he had to shoot and fight, we saw how, after his victory, he endeavored above all to win over the defeated for German culture. To bring security and peace to the country and its people. What Wißmann did after the battles to calm the conquered country, to secure the peace he had fought for, is not the least of his great successes. We admire in Wißmann not only his fearless courage and his resolute strength of action, but above all we see in him a true picture of manly, purposeful efficiency and a loyalty to duty that never considers itself and its glory, but always keeps its task in mind, such as is genuinely German and especially the tried and tested nature of German soldiers. As long as Germany calls such men her own, she will not lose her high reputation, as everywhere else, so also in Africa, and will retain her position of honor at the head of all nations that are fighting for the

Page 188

The Reich's forces will forever stand their ground in the fight against the slave trade and for the spread of written culture in Africa. Our glorious, but never restless conqueror and organizer of East Africa, the Reichskommissiar Major von Wißmann, long live Reg. Reg.=Rat Frhr v. Tucher, toasted His Serene Highness the Prince of Hohenlohe=Langen burg and His Excellency Minister of State v. Hofmann in the following words: We have come to Cologne under circumstances that have never been more difficult, indeed more critical for the German colonial cause and for the position and further development of our society. The Assembly, for its part, had, he believed, shown itself equal to the situation. It had expressed its views and those of the circles behind it in a manly and measured manner, as far removed from angry agitation as from fearful consideration. This gratifying success was due to the spirit of unity that animates the German Colonial Society in all its parts. The cultivation of this spirit is primarily the merit of our esteemed President, Your Serene Highness the Prince of Hohenlohe, and his devoted, prudent management of the Society, but also, as far as the present meeting is concerned, of the measured, conciliatory work of our esteemed Chairman, Your Excellency the Minister of State v. Hofmann. Both gentlemen deserve the thanks of the German Colonial Society, which those present wish to express with three cheers. The German-British Agreement. According to the Reichs= und Staatsanzeiger, the agreement between Germany and Great Britain on the various questions concerning colonial interests reads as follows: The undersigned: the Imperial Chancellor, General of the Infantry von Caprivi, the Privy Legation Councillor in the Foreign Office Dr. Krauel, the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Her Britannic Majesty Sir Edward Baldwin Malet, the Head of the African Department of Her Majesty's Foreign Office, Sir Henry Percy Anderson, having discussed various questions concerning the colonial interests of Germany and Great Britain, have concluded the following agreement on behalf of their governments: Article 1: In East Africa the territory reserved to Germany for the assertion of her influence shall be bounded: 1. on the north by a line which shall start from the northern shore of the mouth of the Umbe River and run in a straight line to Lake Jipe. Along the eastern shore of the lake and around the northern shore of the same, the line then crosses the river Lumi to cut the Taveta and Dschagga landscapes in the middle, and then along the northern slope of the Kilima=Rdscharo mountain range, to be continued in a straight line to that point on the eastern shore of Lake Victoria-Nyanza, which is met by the first degree of southern latitude. From here, crossing the lake at the aforementioned latitude, it follows the latter to the border of the Congo State, where it ends. It is, however, understood that the German sphere of interest on the western side of the said lake does not include the Mfumbiroberg. If it should turn out that this mountain lies south of the latitude mentioned, the boundary line shall be drawn in such a way that it excludes the mountain from the German sphere of interest, but nevertheless returns to the end point previously indicated, which, starting on the coast from the northern border of the province of Mozambique, follows the course of the Rovuma River to the point where the M'sinje River flows into the Rovuma, and from there continues westwards along the parallel of latitude to the shore of Lake Nyassa. Then, turning northwards, it continues along the eastern, northern and western shores of the lake to the northern shore of the mouth of the Songwe River. It then ascends this river to its intersection with the 33rd degree of east longitude and follows it further to the point where it comes closest to the boundary of the geographical Congo basin described in the first article of the Verlin Conference, as shown on the map attached to the 9th Protocol of the Conference. From here, it shall proceed in a straight line towards the boundary previously imagined and shall run along it as far as its intersection with the 32nd degree of east longitude, then turn in a straight line towards the point where the north and south branches of the Kilambo River meet, which it shall then follow as far as its mouth in Lake Tanganyika. The course of the proposed border is generally indicated according to a map of the Nyassa=Tanganyika plateau, which was officially drawn up for the British government in 1889. I. In the west by a line which, from the mouth of the Kilambo River to 1 degree south latitude, coincides with the border of the Congo State. The territory reserved to Great Britain for the assertion of her influence is bounded: 1. in the south by the aforesaid line from the mouth of the Umbe River to the point of the Congo Free State which is crossed by the 1st degree of south latitude. Mount Mfumbiro is included in this area. 2. in the north by a line which begins at the coast at the north user of the Juba River, the

Page 189

The borderline of the Nile River runs along the bank of the river mentioned above and coincides with the border of the area reserved for Italian influence in Gallaland and Abyssinia as far as the borders of Egypt. 3. to the west by the Congo Free State and by the western watershed of the upper Nile basin. Article II In order to carry out the delimitation described in the preceding article, Germany withdraws her patronage of Witu in favor of Great Britain. Great Britain undertakes to recognize the sovereignty of the Sultan of Witu over the territory extending from Kipini to the point opposite the island of Kweihn fixed as the boundary in 1887. Germany further renounces her sovereignty over the coast bordering on Witu as far as Kismaju and her claims to territories on the mainland north of the Tana River and to the islands of Patta and Manda. Article III. In South-West Africa the territory reserved to Germany for the assertion of her influence shall be bounded: 1. in the south by a line beginning at the mouth of the Orange River and running up the north bank of the river to the point where it is joined by the 20th degree of east longitude. 2. to the east by a line which starts from the aforementioned point and follows the 20th degree east longitude to its intersection with the 22nd degree south latitude. The line then runs eastward along this parallel to the point where it is intersected by the 21st degree of east longitude, it then runs northward up the said meridian to its junction with the 18th degree of south latitude, then runs eastward along this parallel until it reaches the Chobe River, and then continues in the valley of the main course of this river to its mouth in the Zambesi, where it ends. It is agreed that by this provision Germany shall have free access from her protectorate to the Zambesi by means of a strip of land which at no point is less than 20 English miles wide. The territory reserved to Great Britain for the assertion of her influence is bounded in the west and north-west by the line previously described. The NGami=Sea is included in the same. The course of the proposed boundary is generally shown on a map drawn officially for the British Government in 1889. The determination of the southern boundary of the British Whale Bay Territory shall be reserved for decision by arbitration unless an agreement between the Powers on the boundary is reached within two years from the signature of this Convention. Both Powers agree that, as long as the settlement of the boundary question is pending, the passage and transit of goods through the territory in dispute shall be free for the subjects of both sides, and that the treatment of the latter in the territory shall be equal in all respects. No duty shall be levied on goods in transit, and until the matter is settled the territory shall be considered neutral. Article IV In West Africa: 1. the boundary between the German protectorate of Togo and the British Gold Coast colony shall be drawn on the coast from the boundary markers set at the negotiations of the mutual commissioners of July 14 and 28, 1886, and shall extend in a northerly direction to the parallel of 6° 10 north latitude. From here it runs west along the said parallel to the left bank of the Aka River and then climbs up the valley of the latter to the parallel 6° 20 north latitude. It then continues along this parallel in a westerly direction to the right bank of the Jawe or Shavoe River, follows this bank of this river to the parallel of latitude determined by the point where the Deine River joins the Volta, and then continues westwards along the imaginary parallel of latitude to the Volta. From this point it continues along the left bank of the Volta until it reaches the neutral zone agreed in the 1888 treaty, which begins at the confluence of the Dakka River with the Volta. Each of the two Powers undertakes, immediately after the conclusion of this Agreement, to withdraw all its officials and employees from the territory assigned to the other Power by the above determination of boundaries. (2) It having been proved to the satisfaction of both Governments that there is no river in the Gulf of Guinea corresponding to the Rio del Rey shown on the maps and referred to in the Convention of 1885, it is agreed that the provisional boundary between the German territory of Cameroon and the adjoining British territory shall be a line running from the upper end of the Rio del Rey creek in a straight line to the point at about 9° 8" east longitude, which is marked "Rapids" on the British Admiralty map. Article V. It is agreed that treaties and agreements made by or for the benefit of either Power in the regions north of the Benus shall not prejudice the right of the other Power to trade freely in transit to and from the shores of Lake Chad without the payment of transit duties. Of all treaties concluded in the territory situated between the Benus and Lake Chad, the one Power shall notify the other. Article VI All the lines of demarcation mentioned in Articles I to IV may be adjusted by agreement between the two Powers, if such adjustments appear necessary in view of local circumstances. In particular, agreement shall be reached on

Page 190

 that, with respect to the boundaries mentioned in Article 1V, Commissioners shall meet as soon as possible for the purpose of effecting such rectification. Article VII. Each of the two Powers undertakes to abstain from any interference in the sphere of interests conceded to the other by Articles 1 to 1V of the present Convention. Neither Power shall make acquisitions, conclude treaties, assume rights of sovereignty or protectorates in the sphere of interest of the other, or prevent the extension of the influence of the other. It is understood that companies or individuals belonging to one Power shall not be permitted to exercise rights of sovereignty within the sphere of interest of the other Power, except with the consent of the latter. Article VIII. The two Powers undertake to apply the provisions of these Articles in all those parts of their territories within the free trade zone designated in the Act of the Berlin Conference of 1885 to which the first five Articles of the said Act are applicable at the date of the present Convention. Trade shall enjoy complete freedom; navigation on the lakes, rivers and canals and the ports situated thereon shall be free to both flags; no unequal treatment in respect of transportation or coasting trade shall be permitted; no duties shall be imposed on commodities of any origin other than such as may be levied, to the exclusion of unequal treatment, for expenses incurred for the benefit of trade; no transit duties shall be imposed and no monopolies or trade favors shall be granted. The nationals of both Powers shall be permitted to establish themselves freely in the territories of both Powers, in so far as they are situated in the free trade zone. In particular, it is agreed that, in accordance with these provisions, the reciprocal movement of goods between Lake Nyassa and the Congo State, between Lake Ryassa and Lake Tanganyika, on Lake Tanganyika and between this lake and the northern boundary of the two spheres shall be free from any obstacle and any transit duty Article IX. Commercial and mining concessions, as well as rights to land, which companies or private individuals of one Power have acquired within the sphere of interest of the other Power, shall be recognized by the latter, provided the validity of the same is sufficiently demonstrated. It is understood that the concessions must be exercised in accordance with the laws and regulations in force in the place Article X. In all the territories of Africa belonging to or under the influence of either Power, missionaries of both countries shall enjoy full protection; religious toleration and freedom for all forms of worship and spiritual instruction are assured. Article XI. Great Britain will exert all her influence to facilitate a friendly agreement whereby the Sultan of Zanzibar will cede to Germany without reservation his possessions situated on the mainland and mentioned in the existing concessions of the German East African Society, together with dependencies, as well as the island of Masia. It is agreed that His Highness shall at the same time receive equitable compensation for the loss of revenue resulting from this cession. Germany undertakes to recognize the protectorate of Great Britain over the remaining possessions of the Sultan of Zanzibar, including the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba, as well as over the possessions of the Sulkan of Witu and the neighbouring territory as far as Kismaju, from where the German protectorate will be withdrawn. It is agreed that, if the cession of the German coast has not taken place before the assumption of the Patronage of Zanzibar by Great Britain, Her Majesty's Government will, on the assumption of that Patronage, undertake to exert all their influence to induce the Sultan to effect that cession as soon as possible, on payment of a cheap indemnity. Article XII. 1. subject to the consent of the British Parliament, the sovereignty over the Island of Heligoland, together with its appurtenances, shall be ceded by Her Britannic Majesty to Her Majesty the German Emperor. (2) The German Government shall grant to persons coming from the ceded territory the right to choose British nationality by means of a declaration to be made before January 1, 1892, by themselves or, in the case of minor children, by their parents or guardians. (3) Persons originating in the ceded territory and their children born before the date of signature of this Convention shall remain exempt from military service in the army and navy in Germany. (4) The presently existing domestic laws and customs shall, as far as possible, remain unchanged. 5. the German Government undertakes not to increase the customs tariff currently in force in the ceded territory until January 1, 1910. (6) All property rights which private persons or existing corporations have acquired against the British Government in Heligoland shall remain in force; the obligations corresponding thereto shall devolve upon His Majesty the German Emperor. The expression "property rights" includes the signaling rights of NDL. 7. the rights of British fishermen to anchor in all weathers, to take in food and water, to make repairs, to load goods from one ship to another, to sell fish, to land and to sell fish, and to land and sell fish. The right to sell fish, to land and to dry fish remains unaffected. Berlin, July 1, 1890. by Caprivi. R. Krauel. Edward B. Malet. H. Percy Anderson. The colonial situation. The thoroughly pessimistic mood about the future of East Africa, which was expressed here and there in the circles of colonial friends after the announcement of the Anglo-German treaty, has gradually given way to a calmer view. On the one hand, the apparent impossibility of achieving a different, more favorable result through any amendments, then the thought that even within the narrower borders we still have an enormous amount to do for centuries to come and that sooner or later a different political constellation in Europe may also benefit our colonies, provided their development requires special demands, but above all the consideration of the necessity that it is in our own interest not to damage the development of East Africa through excessive pessimism. Our interests would be damaged, however, if capital were deterred from further investment in East Africa and the view became general that the entire salvation of East Africa lay in the possession of Zanzibar. At the Cologne General Assembly, Consul Vohsen already indicated the various points that are important in assessing the situation; in the brochure now available,') particular reference is made to a very striking example of the extent to which an island loses its commercial value with the increasing development of the mainland, the island of Gorée, which belongs to the French Senegalese colony. When the French began to seriously develop the west coast of Africa through barter trade, they preferred to base their settlements on the island, which offered a sufficiently safe harbor, while the landing sites on the coast were the most difficult imaginable, and where they also had the advantage of being protected against attacks by the natives. However, as the French subjugated the Senegal region further inland, concluded treaties with the chiefs, and the products flowed to the coast in greater quantities, a decentralization of trade slowly took place, and the coastal settlements of Dakar and Rusisque flourished to the same extent, especially as the French government also made great efforts to improve the landing conditions, as Gorée declined, and the time is not far off when the latter - although it has been made a free port in order to be able to compete with the coast - will lose all importance as a trading center and will probably only serve as a sanatorium. There is, however, a huge difference between the large island of Zanzibar with its relic culture, a flourishing commercial city rich in capital and people, the seat of the large business houses, in the most favorable location, whether one comes from India, Madagascar, Mozambique or the north, and the small, insignificant rocky island of Gorée with its few large entrepôts and a sluggish mixed population, but the trade is also quite different in both countries. The Senegal area mainly exports olive fruits, which do not fetch high prices, and only has rubber as a highly valued mass product, while the export of a much larger, richer zone, especially ivory, rubber and copal, flows to the East African coast. If Zanzibar is important, the coast and the hinterland are incomparably more valuable, and provided that a concerted effort is now made to develop the coast, the same process will take place in East Africa as in Zanzibar.*) Derselde will be accelerated by the fact that The German-English Treaty. Lecture given by Erust Bohsen, retired consul and director of the German East African Society, at the general meeting of the German Colonial Society in Cologne on July 1, 1890, Berlin. Fontane 1890. Thus writes a correspondent of the Frankfurter Zeitung, which has no particular sympathies for German colonization, from Zanzibar under the title

Page 191

the East African coast has several good harbours, the entrance and landing places can be put in good condition at relatively low cost, while Zanzibar only has an open rhede that is exposed to the monsoons, that the German-East African steamship line will ensure regular traffic with the mainland ports, as it is primarily intended to benefit German colonization, and that the East African and other companies will take advantage of the reasonable opportunity offered by establishing factories and plantations. The subscription of the German East African Society for three million marks has, to our delight, been a good success, proof that confidence in the development of East Africa is deepening, new societies have been formed or are in the process of being formed, and the basis for comprehensive activity is developing more and more with more precise knowledge of the country. Given the lack of transportation routes from the interior, it is certainly economically correct to first consider the coastal areas and their surroundings for the cultivation of products, but the exploration of the auxiliary sources of the interior should by no means suffer as a result. The imperial government has made great efforts in this regard by sending Emin and Stokes, which is to be acknowledged with gratitude, although it is doubtful whether their journeys have a more political or economic purpose, but the German East African Society, if it understands its task correctly, should not be inferior. As is well known, it has sent Dr. Baumann to the north, but one must take a look at the map of the south published in No. 8 of the Kolonialzeitung and read the series of articles on this subject, which will be continued in this issue, to come to the conclusion that we still know very little about the conditions in this area and that research in terms of trade policy has become a necessity. The establishment of scientific-commercial stations or even stations from which the explorer and merchant can get to know the country, which we warmly recommended for East Africa at the beginning of this year, has become a necessity more than ever, and the establishment of systematically managed experimental plantations is becoming more urgent from day to day. After we had been thrown back in East Africa, far-reaching plans for such plantations, on which, however, the later economic development in the still almost unknown regions can be based, had to be abandoned; today, after a firm framework has been created by the border regulation, the time has come again when science and practice must work together for the best of the country. We have seen how beneficially these stations have already worked in Cameroon and Togo, and how the trade of Vatangaland has begun to take a completely new turn since it has been possible to break through the ring of middlemen from the stations in the interior. In addition to the economic activity, missionary activity must also begin anew and strive more towards the interior to the less spoiled peoples, who, as the example of Uganda has shown, offer rewarding fields of work, and the humanitarian societies in general must limit their efforts to the mainland. After the suppression of the slave trade, the imperial government still has the most important task of organizing the administration in a way that is as little as possible based on the French bureaucratic model, but more on the English colonial administration. It must, if it is not to create disgruntlement again, show a skillful hand in the selection of personalities and set up the administration in such a way that the process of transforming the Company Colony into a Crown Colony, which will inevitably come, proceeds without major upheaval and meets with universal approval. It must, as I have said, proceed according to plan. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Baron von Marschall, has announced a program for the autumn, according to which the government intends to proceed, which has been welcomed with joy. In possession of the coast, we can now do as we please. But then it will be the same for all colonial friends: Hie Rhodus, hie salta! June 23: "I am firmly convinced that the stretch of coast that is now in German possession is one of the best to be found in East Africa. The harbors are excellent and large caravan routes lead to the interior. Confidence in the Germans is growing daily, and caravans are coming from the lakes, bringing letters and expressions of friendship....
The great south.") The high plateau between Nyassa and Tanganyika. The land between the Nyassa, Tanganyika and Rikwa lakes, part of which was granted to us by the Anglo-German treaty, has been the stomping ground of English missionaries for many years, who have established a whole chain of stations on the high plateau. With a few insignificant exceptions, these have now remained in English ownership, as has the Stevenson Road due to the new border agreement, which is shown on the map on page 188 according to the latest models. For this area we are now almost entirely dependent on the information provided by British travelers and missionaries, as Wissmann only spent a very short time here, but from everything that has been said about it, it is clear that this country and its population are more interesting and more estimable than was previously assumed. The June issue of the Scottish Geographical Magazine, for example, contains a lengthy work from the pen of the missionary Kerr Croß, who was consulted on the English side as an expert on the demarcation questions, which, based on the earlier English investigations, contains so much new information that a longer excerpt should be of general interest He divides the country into three districts. 1. the area north of Nyassa, comprising the Awanyakynsa, Awakukwe, Awabundali and Awamesuko tribes, 2. the first part of the Nyassa-Tanganyika plateau with the Awawandia, Utambo and Uwurambia tribes, 3. the Mpoko, Unyika and Miwunga country as far as the little-known Lake Rikwa. The land of the Awanyakyusa, or as they call themselves, the Awamasoko, perhaps one of the richest in the Nyassa area, stretches from the Livingstone Mountains along the lake for a width of fifteen to twenty miles to Karonga. The area is flat, swampy in places, and was no doubt once covered by the lake; it is very fertile and well watered, so that two or three harvests a year are possible. Some of the plains are under water for months at a time, during which time the banana-covered mounds are inhabited by the natives. These banana plantations are their pride; they stretch in long lines along the ridges, so that one can walk six or seven hours in a straight line from village to village without once being forced to leave their cool shade. The people own a great many cattle, which are tended with the greatest care and housed in special stables or in the huts. This country is very well irrigated, as a glance at the map shows; the Lufira, Mbaka, Kiwirwa, Nsessi and Songwe carry water constantly, and some of them are navigable a few miles from the mouth, as the M'baka has already been navigated by the mission steamer "Ilala". Kerr Croß's description of the Awanyakyusa villages is very pretty. When you land on the sandy beach, you enter a banana grove and walk along a perfectly flat path as if in the palm section of a botanical garden. Weeds and garbage have been cleared out of the way by the boys who do this work in the morning hours. Hidden under the trees are the round huts of the natives, built of bamboo and mud bricks. The roof is made of reeds and, like the hat of a mushroom, extends beyond the walls, while the door is so large that a man can walk in upright. The doorposts are often painted in red, yellow or other colors, so that the houses present a very friendly and comfortable appearance. The unmarried men live in square houses, often twenty steps long, with interwoven bamboo walls. These banana hedges are overhung in places by large shady trees, called misuangute, in whose cool shade fires are lit on hot days, in whose smoke the cattle stand and ruminate undisturbed by flies. Food, bananas, sweet potatoes, cassava, hams, corn, beans, peas, millet, wild fruits, honey, milk and beef are available in abundance. There are over twenty different types of bananas and plantains alone, given special names by the natives. The banana is particularly valuable, from whose leaves the natives make mats, blankets and ropes and from whose fruit they produce flour, bread and wine. The huts are not only clean on the outside, but also on the inside, as all the cooking utensils and the floor are always kept clean, as can be seen from the *) See Nos. 7, 8, 10, 11 of this volume.

natives of Africa are known to be rare. The natives are muscular and well-built, friendly and like to show hospitality." Once you have walked through the land of the Awanyakyusa, you reach the high plateau, the lowest level of which also has rich soil and is well irrigated, so that Croß thinks that tea and coffee would grow excellently here in the land of the Awakukwe. The land of the Awakukwe lies like a riche in the middle of the surrounding mountains and is about 30 English miles long and from 6 to 10 miles wide. Consul Elton*) describes this area as follows The region through which we have come is without exception the most beautiful part of Africa that we have seen. Even Natal, the famous "Garden of South Africa", cannot compete with it in terms of fertility or abundance of grass. It is made up of a series of valleys 3,000 to 5,000 feet above the sea, between gentle ridges and pyramidal hills, bordered by the rich foothills of the mountains or walled in by high chains, in the east by the extension of the Livingstone Mountains, which hold the warlike Makanywala" sern and break the connection with the coast here. He continues: "We have now marched over forty miles through an area that is the most favorable for European subtropical cultivation that I have ever seen. On this plateau, near the village of Kararamuka, i.e. still in German territory, lies the northernmost station of the Livingstonia mission, which was only recently established, perhaps in the hope of bringing this area under English influence. The highest elevation of the plateau lies in the settled English area and begins to the west of the Songwe, which in some respects also forms an ethnic divide. The villages on the plateau, which cannot bear comparison with the lower-lying area in terms of the advantages for colonization, are surrounded by pallisades and ditches, built close together, i.e. laid out like real bomas, usually on a river or the confluence of two such rivers. The inhabitants and their livestock live inside these enclosures, whose fumes are noticeable from afar during the rainy season. This state of habitation has proved necessary as a result of the many attacks by slave traders, one of whom, Merere, a very important one, has chosen the Wungu Mountains as his residence. The villages are very scattered, averaging one every two or three English miles. In November, Croß made a journey from N'scherenji to Lake Rikwa, which took him up the Songwe to Chitete. The Songwe valley had been devastated by the raids of the Awawemba living on Lake Bangweolo, who were hired and armed by the Arabs, the villages had been burnt down and the inhabitants dragged away into slavery. The chief of Chitete was also in league with the Arabs, who had supplied him with powder and guns, so that he was burning with eagerness to link up with the weaker villages. With. Chitete, the Sonqwe is about 12 yards wide and knee-deep. The inhabitants of the Awanyika country differ greatly, but not favorably, from the Awanyakyusa. They are physically weaker, lean rather than slim, with thick heads, and live in pallisadirate, extremely dirty villages. Banau are unknown, cattle are few and far between. Croß, who saw the region at the beginning of the rainy season, describes it as a plain covered with grass, interspersed with ridges, with occasional groups of trees and very rich in game. Iron is available, is smelted and processed into spears, axes, hoes, etc., just as the natives spin and weave the abundant wild cotton and have many industries. The iron smelters, built of rods and clay, are a full nine feet high with a diameter of five feet at the bottom and three feet at the top, and hold about half a ton of iron ore, brown hematite, which lies close to the ground. The fuel is charcoal. At Chitete he was joined by the English consul in Mozambique, H. H. Johnston, who wanted to travel from Nyassa to Tanganyika, and both marched together to Lake Rikwa through the Miwungu Gebict. The descent from the plateau had its difficulties*) There is only one point that disturbs the pretty picture of these villages. It is clear that the lower terrain is swampy and favorable for the development of malaria, which is not the case in the higher areas. But how is it that the natives are so well developed physically / The general opinion is that swampy areas degenerate the races, but in no area of the Nyassa, according to Croß, is a more strongly developed people to be found than at the northern end Poung visited the high plateau in 1876, Elton in 1878, Thomson and Stewart in 1879, later Giraud, Wißmann, more recently Trivier, the first French "traverser" of Africa. *) Also called Magwangwara.
The natives were unfriendly, the water was bad, the land arid and scorched, overgrown only with thorny acacia species. A "sultan" wanted to block their way to the lake and as his people were well armed, the travelers found it very uncomfortable to stay in the terribly hot, unhealthy and food-poor lowlands. After a fruitless palaver, Johnston concentrated backwards with his 150 men and disappeared into the night, leaving Croß alone with his 10 men.*) However, the missionary still managed to come to terms with the chief and stayed in his village for a full week. From there, crossing a number of small, brackish streams teeming with waterbucks and other antelope species, he reached Kipindi, a small village situated on a hill by the water. The water of the lake is dark-colored, brackish, undrinkable, the banks are swampy. The boy who was to fetch a water sample for Croß had to walk about 300 yards knee-deep through the mud before he could fill a bottle. The water of Lake Rikwa, which is about 80-90 English miles long, is very low at the moment, as it has not rained in this area for two years. Croß saw neither hippos nor crocodiles, of which Johnston tells us, but the country is very rich in game, elephants, buffaloes and antelopes are abundant and are hunted diligently by the natives, as they are dependent on hunting animals and people, the latter being sold to Unyamwezi, due to the poor harvests. Croß then went back to Momwongo and took a more frequent route than on the outward march, which led him via Mireya to Chitete. In one village he found a couple of old English three-foot-long cannons, which had been brought here by the Arabs and used in the slave hunts. Close to Mireya, the Songwe has worked its way through limestone cliffs, which are several hundred feet high and rich in all kinds of shells. This concludes Croß's travelogue, which at the end refers to the merits of the English in the exploration of these regions, a reminder which, as we know, has had the unfortunate result for us that our border from the Rikuru, which was originally intended, has been shifted to the Songwe. The map of Stanley's latest work. "Reviewers almost always omit to mention the maps accompanying their travelogues." Thus Stanley introduces a chapter*) of his book full of his own praise, telling us how, in the three years of his journey, he took three chronometers a day, made three hundred observations and even calculated them himself, drew them on the map and spent a total of 780 hours of honest labor on the latter. He seems to believe that those members of the public who lack the patience to read through his venomous polemic against everyone, which fills hundreds of pages, must at least be in awe of his map and follow his energetic: Plaudite cives! will follow. Looking at the map, the first thing that strikes the observer is its green coloring, which covers more than four-fifths of the paper and consists of nothing but small trees. What may have prompted Stanley to inscribe this entire area, of which he has only covered the top quarter, with the colossal inscription "The Great Forest" can only be explained by the author's desire to make the forest, and therefore his achievement, appear quite large. After all, he reckons 2690 kilometers of forest to the Scottish geologist Drummond in order to impress him, but admits on the following page that his forest route, if you only take it into account once, is only 526 kilometers.") But how can it be explained that Stanley's green forest coloring extends to the northern edge of his map, over the entire terrain explored by Junker, when we have long since learned from Junker that he only saw the first forest on the southern bank of the Nepoko? The disparaging remark about Junker and Schweinfurth: *) In a preliminary report on his journey (Aprilhest of the Proceodings of the Royal geographical Socioty), Johnston passed over the fact that he did not even reach the lake, but only saw it from a distance. However, he gives a precise description of its shores, its abundance of animals, water and inhabitants, so that the innocent reader must assume that Johnston had examined the lake in detail. What his description of the country (see page 114 of the Kolonialzeitung, footnote) is all about is therefore easy to guess. *) Volume II page 303. 3) Volume 1I page 67. *) See Petermann's Geographische Mitteilungen 1889 page 120.

Page 193

"They are regarded as experts in Cairo" is explanation enough. Stanley has become such a great man that if he needs a forest he has not seen for his greater glorification, the contradictory judgment of those who have seen nothing of the forest on the spot cannot carry any weight. Nothing is known about the nature of the soil in the southern two-thirds of Stanley's map; Stanley could just as easily have painted the cannibals*) and dwarves mentioned in almost every chapter under his trees, as was the custom in the old good times, and it would have been impossible to prove the opposite of his statements. Whoever looks at Junker's marked route in the north, which at two points comes within two days' march of Stanley's path, wonders why on earth it could be necessary to sacrifice hundreds of human lives to explore a twelve-mile-wide strip of African terra incognita instead of simply following Junker's route and going from there to Emin without famine and bloodshed, as Junker did. Such considerations also seem to have been made in Stanley's camp at the time of the emergency. We learn (albeit only indirectly) that one of Stanley's six white companions asked for permission to go after Schweinfurth's and Junker's wave. "His duty was clearly before him and yet he did not see it," says Stanley angrily." When he reached the mouth of the Nepoko, which Junker had been exploring, he was, as mentioned above, only two days' march from Junker's territory. Junker's Monbuttu boy, who accompanied Stanley, asks the latter to march through "lands inhabited by decent people and not through such a terrible region". The Momfu tribes in the north would certainly welcome people who could prove that they appreciate hospitality. Stanley himself says that he was already mentally considering a change of route on the basis of these remarks, and adds: "Had I known that we would meet Arabs and their evil Manyema hordes a week later, I would no doubt have endeavored to put a degree of latitude between them and myself. If we look at the map, everyone will notice that just then, when Stanley got into the biggest red in the camp of the Arab Ugarrowas, he was closer to Junker's route than ever, but despite all this, for the greater honor of Stanley, we had to march straight ahead, even if it cost hundreds of lives, that it would have been much more beneficial for his people and for science if he had once connected the route he had taken three times between Albert Nyanza and Pambuya with one of the points touched by Junker, was, as the map shows, completely ignored. A single detour is shown on the map, but it was made at a point where it would have been impossible to follow Junker's tracks. The west of the map shows us the course of the Congo and Grenfell's Lomami. The only thing to note about the latter is that although Grenfell noted longer stretches of forest on the banks of the river, there is absolutely no reason to give this area the jungle coloring described above. If we now look at the interesting part of the map, the eastern third of it, the first thing that catches our eye is the height of the Aldert Nyanza. According to Stanley's letter, which arrived in England a year ago, the height of the lake was 700 meters, a value which corresponded very well with Emin's measurements of 696 meters. On Stanley's latest map, however, we find 732 meters. There would be no objection to this either if the Semliki River at a point thirty miles from its mouth in the lake were not given an elevation of only 728 meters. The Semliki River therefore offers the only existing example of a watercourse that flows uphill.") Stanley's theories about the origin of the Ruvenzori Mountains and the two western Nile source lakes may have influenced the terrain depiction of the more distant mountain or hill ranges. Stanley is surprised that his numerous predecessors at Lake Albert never saw this mountain range; he does not mention that he himself, standing almost at the foot of the mountain in 1876, did not see it, but it shows sufficiently that in those regions one is only under extraordinary *) vol. page 52. As a just punishment for such slander, Stanley must experience that his people are begged and fought for a horde of cannidals, a fine example of the prevailing justice of fate. Volume 1I page 106 According to Casati, the Semliki is 665 meters above sea level. (Bolletino della Società Geographica Italiana. May 1890.) Casati also claims the priority of covering the Ruvenzori, to which he had already drawn Emin's attention in 1887 and to which he had indicated a particularly precise route from Unvoro. (Eden himself.) D. R.
favorable air conditions can see a few miles away, and how much we have to take in reserve everything that is not immediately next to Stanley's route and yet is marked on the map. But let us keep quiet about it, lest we be like the geologists of the Royal Geographical Society in London, whom Stanley told in his lecture that he felt sorry for them because they disagreed with him about the origin of the mountains. It cannot be regretted enough that Stanley did not at least attempt to bypass or circumnavigate the lake he called Albert Edward Nyanza, and did not use his friendly relationship with the Great Ankoris to take detours from the main caravan route to further explore Ankori, as he used to do on his earlier journeys. It almost looks as if Stanley had lost all interest in further exploration after failing to win Emin over to his cause. Both the map and the book contain little about the road through the lake, and only in the discovery of the south-western section of Lake Victoria does he go into more detail about the description of the area. The island of Misome, where he thought he saw the end of the lake 14 years ago, lies in the new map about forty kilometers south of Stanley's former destination, and behind it the lake extends another sixty kilometers to the south, "to Stanley's greatest joy and surprise". In specialist circles, where people have been used to seeing Stanley's images shifted by half a degree or even a whole degree for years, they will have been less surprised. On the other hand, the joy that Lake Victoria has moved so much closer to Tanganyika is now, after the German-English agreement, entirely on our side, since that stretch of land falls within the German sphere of interest. If we take into account Speke's elevations, who crossed watercourses belonging to the Tanganyika basin in the immediate vicinity of Stanley's route, it can already be said that there will be no natural obstacles to a route from the south-western tip of Victoria to the eastern shore of Tanganyika. The difficulties of the Stevenson Road (the steep ascent at Nyassa and the even steeper descent at Tanganyika) do not exist here, as the highest point between Victoria and Tanganyika is only two hundred meters above the former. We lose the ronten map of his entire route from Bwanga to Makolo, about 120 kilometers of unexplored territory. We do not know whether the land he passed through was near or far from the waters of the Biktoria. Six lines contain what we are told about this area, as if Stanley wished to avoid anything that might remind us of his mistake, including the outline of the Victoria. The question of whether the land labeled Ufinja in the well-known Perth map of Africa is water or not is therefore still undecided. Hopefully the books by Stanley's companions, which are expected at the end of this year, will tell us a lot more about what Stanley's map leaves us in the dark. It would be unfair if we did not also take note here of what Mr. Stanley, the great cartographer, thinks of other cartographers. In the second volume of his work he tells us: "A cartographer still living is the greatest sinner there is. In 1875 I found a bay at the north-eastern end of Lake Victoria. The bay has been wiped away and young travelers) giggle, as I know, with malicious glee about it and so on. .. I attach at the end the small map which illustrates what we were able to correct during our last journey. I do this in the painful awareness that some stupid English or German mapmaker, out of whim or ignorance, will move the basin 500 or 700 kilometers further east or west to north or south within the next ten years and completely erase our work. . .. The arbitrariness of modern cartographers is as great as that of their predecessors. For example, on a more recent map, which is considered the best in Germany,?) a large bay *) June issue of the Procoedingo of the Royal Geographleal Socloty: "J am sorry for them" *) This probably refers to Thomson. On his return from his great Massa voyage, he reported having found land at the north-east corner of Lake Victoria where Stanley had indicated water, and the maps of the north-east corner of the lake were changed. That Thomson was Stanley's rival on the occasion of the Emin Pasha expedition, we learn from volume 1 page 48. Mr. Stanley does not seem to read the proceedings of the R. Geogr. Society, otherwise he would know that in England, too, the Hassenstein map of Africa (published by Justus Perthes) is considered the best. Incidentally, we leave it to that "greatest sinner there is" to defend himself, should he deem it necessary.

completely removed from the Victoria Nyanza, and a straight line takes the place of the highly interesting and strongly incised coastline, which I explored in 1875. Lake Leopold only escaped extinction by a narrow margin because two Germans, Kund and Tappenbeck, had lost their way and could not find it*)" and so on. Enough, you can see how Stanley treats other people's maps and works. If some of the remarks about his map seem too harsh, Stanley's friends will have to console themselves with the fact that he has been treated far more lightly than his actions against the most illustrious representatives of science deserve. A. W. Schleicher. Accounts from Cameroon. By Georg Baldau. (Conclusion. The inhabitants of Calabar, Cameroon, Batanga and Gabon are not accustomed to orderly and continuous work. They have no needs that could force them to work, and no one has offered them work for pay, so why should they work! Now if a white man happens to come along and offers to do some work for him for a certain payment, they may think that it would not be so bad to have this payment, and to get it they could work just as well as the people whom the white man bolts from far away. They therefore make an agreement with him to work for him for a certain period of time, which is never long and only lasts a few weeks, a month at most. Formerly completely independent and only working when they liked, they are now forced into the narrow confines of a regiment. They have to start work at a certain time and then work continuously for 5-6 hours before being given a break of 1-2 hours, during which time they are also not allowed to leave. This constraint and the hard work soon tire them out, and one day they are late for work or have a "blue day", which results in their punishment, which usually consists of bastinado, which in most cases causes them to run away from work again. This gives rise to the judgment that the Negro is unfit for work. An impartial man, however, who knows the circumstances, will find that in most cases - I do not say all - the fault lies with the white man. He does not realize that he is dealing with people who are completely untrained and unaccustomed to discipline and hard work, but he demands as much from them as from his other workers who have been trained for years. Instead of accustoming them to the work through less rigorous work, a little more freedom and milder punishments, and awakening in them an appetite for it, he has deterred them from any further attempts in this direction through his unwise and strict procedure. This is the suspicion in many cases, but, as I have said, not in all, for some of the coast tribes are so completely corrupted by the commission trade and other causes that they cannot be induced to work even by high pay. On the other hand, the inhabitants of the Cameroon colony are among those for whom it is not at all impossible that they will learn to work. We have had Bakwiri= and recently also Bumboko= and Betikkale people in our service for two years. With a few exceptions, these trials have been satisfactory. Last year we had 20 such people in service, and of these 7 had committed themselves for a year and also served out this time to our satisfaction, while the others had only served for 2 to 6 months; of these latter four were discharged. Of all these 20, only three had previously served a shorter time with us or other whites, so that the result can be described as a very good one, all the more so as they had to work just as hard during the last six months as the cruisers. We were always very careful to ensure that they worked the allotted time, but at the beginning we gave them lighter work and only gradually exchanged it for heavier work. These jobs were of various kinds, such as rowing canoes or boats, loading or unloading goods, carrying sand and stones, clearing or digging shafts and so on. Thus they had and still have greater freedom in the evenings after their work is finished than the cruls. Mistakes were occasionally made in the early days of service, but later they became increasingly rare; the punishments were mild, only theft, which occurred a few times, was punished with bastinado Jn regard to payment, we used a method that proved to be very practical. We did not pay their wages until their term of service had expired, regardless of whether it was one month or one year. At the beginning they received their wages month by month, but this had the consequence that they spent everything and then had no more at the end of the period of service than when they started. If, on the other hand, the laborer receives his wages for several months or a year at a time and then returns to his village with them, he can buy a wife for them or pay a large part of the purchase price for one. This makes him and others realize that it is worthwhile to work for the white man; this encourages him to take up service again and entices others to follow his example. *) Volume II page 274.
In addition, by keeping their wages, one also has a certain security that they will not run away from the service. Of those who worked for us at the beginning, 12, the most unskilled, took a year's service from new recruits, and their example and the treasures they brought home have had such an effect that we can now obtain another 20-30 men at any given time. It will, however, be some years before they are able to replace the cruisers or other workers, and it would be unwise to make ourselves dependent on the natives by removing them. However, the latter can be trained to become good plantation workers, and that is what we are working towards. Nevertheless, I have much higher hopes for the natives of the interior, but especially for their slaves, who come from a distant land unknown to the whites. Nowhere else on the coast will you find such extensive and well-tended plantations as those in Bakundu and Batom. These slaves are not only talented and hard-working agricultural laborers, but also, in stark contrast to the coastal inhabitants, a courageous and warlike people (they are probably originally prisoners of war), and are likely to make good material for soldiers. They could perhaps become for West Africa what the Zanzibarites are for the east coast, with the difference, however, that they are much cheaper than the latter and can therefore be used as agricultural laborers, for which the Zanzibarite is too expensive. We will soon make an experiment with these slaves, and if it is successful and they live up to my expectations, the labor question will be solved and one of the most serious obstacles to the development of the colony will be removed. Further proof that the natives of Cameroon are willing to work is the fact that even the Duallaneg people, who are the most demoralized by the commission deal, are beginning to do all kinds of work. This is entirely due to the government. They are being used more and more by the governorate both in the countryside and, mainly, on board the warships, where they are largely replacing the crew that used to be popular there. What attracts them to this service, despite the strict discipline, is probably the good and plentiful provisions and the relatively light work, which mainly consists of keeping the deck clean. Cleaning the fittings, rowing boats, etc. The German governorate has done itself a great service by endeavoring to do right by all, whites and blacks without distinction, without putting them on the same level or lumping them all together, as the English do in Sierra Leone and other places on the west coast, which only serves to completely ruin the black population, which in these colonies forms a single collection of Canadians. However beautiful it may sound that all should be equal before the law, this cannot be realized between whites and blacks. The black man, the savage, is far behind the white man, the civilized man, in the development of the intellect and in intelligence; in relation to him he is a complete child. Well, let us take a child of 10-12 years of age and place it in an environment where it hears preaching from morning till night that it need not conform to or obey its elders, that it is just as intelligent and wise and has the same right to speak, act and judge in general matters as they do, in a word, that it is equal in everything to its elders - what is to become of such a child? This treatment has been applied by the English Government to the blacks in some of their West African colonies, and the result has been the above. In this, however, the mission has also played a large part. The members of the latter often carry these doctrines on their tongues and put them into practice. In endeavoring to obey the precepts of the Bible on equality, they do not consider that they usually refer to spiritual things, and that where they are to be taken in a secular sense, they have in view peoples of one and the same, or at least nearly the same, degree of culture. The Negro is too low to understand Christianity, which is the religion of the most highly cultured man. Teachings of the kind described above do him more harm than good. When he has learned to read and write to some extent, and has got European clothes on his body - which give him the appearance of a drifter - he believes himself to be a perfect gentleman and as good as any other. He now looks down with contempt on his "unliving" but less deserving black brothers: he believes himself too good for physical labor and therefore usually seeks a place as a "clerk in a factories, where he uses his knowledge of arithmetic and writing to carry out frauds on a large scale. There are exceptions to this, but they are rare, probably not one in a thousand. I myself have known no more than one Reger, a former missionary in Cameroon, whose whole appearance betrayed a truly educated man; it should be noted, however, that he was born and educated in America and was the son of wealthy parents. Instead of the lazy negroes learning to work in the missionary institutions, most of them leave these institutions lazier than ever, defiant, conceited, and with a false idea of their own excellence. Clearly, the so-called civilized regents have a very bad reputation on the whole coast. We have had as little contact with them as possible and have never taken one into our service. Those of our friends who have tried to do so have often had to regret it. In disputes between a white man and a black man in Sierra Leone or Accra, it is usually the white man who has to pay, regardless of whether he is right or wrong, because in most cases the black man has nothing to pay with and is therefore taken to prison, where he lives free for a longer or shorter period, i.e. at the expense of the white man.
