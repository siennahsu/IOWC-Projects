to base our ideas about the art and culture of the peoples and their art-historical development on their evaluation.  In China, we are fortunately also familiar with the magnificent, I would like to say 'living' examples of these stillborn funeral vessels, and the above explanations show that this type of observation can contain very great shortcomings. As in China, funeral vessels elsewhere will have been much more poorly made and stylistically inferior to the indifferent utilitarian objects. In addition, however, a schematic style will have gradually developed for the funerary objects that the objects above ground never possessed. If, for example, we look at the idols from the Mexican tombs, which depict the same types in deadly boredom, crudely and meaninglessly, we can assume that such things never existed above ground in Mexico either, i.e. in Mexican culture. The forms may have developed independently over the centuries from some ancient model and lost all contact with the art of the living.  It seems to me that this opens up a broad perspective for the evaluation of prehistoric grave finds. For the most part, they are "things in themselves".  The Wanjamwesi. A contribution to the ethnology of East Africa. By Fritz Spellig.  The following work is a summary of records that I made during my ten-year stay (from 1910-1920) as a missionary of the Evangelical Unity of Brethren, Herrnhut, in Unjamwesi. It is intended more as a general overview, a rounded picture of the people as a whole, than as a detailed, strictly scientific study. If the report therefore has gaps here and there and the presentation of individual chapters is somewhat brief, it should be pointed out that the author's actual profession left him little time for scientific work and that ethnological observations could not be made primarily for their own sake, but only as a sideline, as a means to an end. On the other hand, the author considered it necessary to present only those observations and results in this context for whose correctness he could give a full guarantee. This work is mainly based on my own notes. However, it has also been possible to use reports from some of my colleagues, which is gratefully acknowledged. Where such works have been used, the name of origin is given wherever possible.  1 The distribution area of the Wanjamwesi.  The area inhabited by the Wanjamwesi in the broadest sense encompasses almost the entire central highlands of the former German East Africa, from 31 to 34 degrees east longitude v. Gr. Gr. and latitude 3° to 8° south, and is known as ''Unjamwesi'' or Großunjamwesi Zeitschrift für Ethnologie. Vol. 1927/28. issue 3/g. 14

(Unjamwesi - the land of the Wanjamwesi). It borders the countries of Ufipa, Uha and Urundi to the west, Uhehe, Uloli and the Rukwasenke to the south, Ugogo, Turu and Iramba to the east, Ussukuma and Usindja to the north, and extends over an area of about 194,000 square kilometers. It thus covers about one fifth of the area of our former colony of German East Africa. The number of Wanjamwesi inhabiting this area is conservatively estimated to be about 1100000, resulting in a population density of 5-6. In addition, before the war there were about 25,000 Wanjamwesi outside Unjamwesis, who had settled mainly in the coastal districts (Bagamojo, Tanga, Dar es Salaam, Kilwa, Lindi) and in the north-west of the colony (Moschi, Pangani, Wilhelmstal) in the plant-rich districts of Morogoro and Kilossa.  U. About the meaning of the name.  In the past, the name Wanjamwesi was generally translated as "moon people". Edmund Dahl still gives this interpretation in his detailed Njamwesi dictionary (Abhandlungen des Hamburgischen Kolonialinstituts Vol. XXV). The name was derived from "mwesi', or "mwezi' (z = soft s), the moon. However, as is generally assumed today, this translation is probably not correct. Wanjamwesi rather means 'people of the west' (mwesi is synonymous with mweli-= west). That this interpretation is the only correct one can be seen, for example, from the fact that a sub-tribe of the Wanjamwesi on the western border actually calls itself Wanjamweli, i.e. People of the West. The name was in all likelihood given to them on the east coast, as they maintained a lively trade with the coast as traders, hunters and porters and have always attracted the attention of the coastal inhabitants through their united appearance and their special customs and traditions. As a rule, they call themselves by the various districts: Wakimbu, Wakonongo, Wanjamweli, Wanjanjembe, Wasukuma etc. As a collective name, however, the term Wanjamwesi is fully justified, since all the tribes and peoples grouped under it show a fairly uniform character in somatic and linguistic terms as well as with regard to customs and traditions.  III. the language.  Linguistically, the Wanjamwesi belong to the large African group of peoples known collectively as the "Bantu peoples". However, Kinjamwesi, the language of the Wanjamwesi, is divided into a number of dialects, some of which are very different, the most important of which are: Kisukuma (in the north), Kirugaruga (spoken most purely in the Urambo region, north of the Midland Railway), Kigalaganza (in the Tabora district) and Kikonongo (in the south of Unjamwesi). Apart from these, there is a whole range of smaller dialects which, however, are closely related to the main dialect groups and only have local significance. While the old people, women and children speak almost exclusively the dialects used in the individual regions, the generally understood Kirugaruga (= the language of the warriors) plays a major role as a colloquial language among the men; and it is no coincidence that this dialect is spoken most purely in the Urambo district (about 50 km north of the Midland Railway). After all, Urambo was the seat of the feared and conquering Grand Chief Mirambo, the Napoleon of Central Africa,


Page 203

as Stanley calls him, who, through his numerous conquests, contributed a great deal to giving the various larger and smaller tribes of the Unjamwesi highlands a more uniform linguistic character. In proper appreciation of this fact, the mission also primarily elevated Kirugaruga to the status of a written language. The fairy tales, songs, proverbs and riddles given below in the original language may serve as samples of Kinjamwesi. In addition, I refer to the grammars published by the various missionary societies, such as: "Eine Kinjamwesigrammatik" by R. Stern, former mission superintendent of the Evangelical Brethren (Mitteilungen des Seminars für Orientalische Sprachen, 1906 III. Abt.); as well as the "Grammatik der Kinjamwesisprache'" by Fr. Franz Müller, Salzburg 1904, published by the St. Petrus Claver-Sodalität für die afrikanischen Missionen. And finally, I would like to mention the detailed "Njamwesi dictionary" by Edmund Dahl, who was a missionary of the Evangelical Unity of Brethren (Abhandlungen des Hamburgischen Kolonial- instituts Band XXV). The latter work is a more comprehensive work which, in addition to Kirugaruga, also largely takes into account the other leading Kinjamwesi dialects.  IV. From the history of the Wanjamwesi.  The Wanjamwesi have no actual historical tradition. The few scanty data from the recent past crystallize around the names of individual chiefs who stand out from the usual monotony of the masses through their conquering and domineering behaviour. By contrast, what lies more than three or at most four generations back disappears in a gray fog of myth-making. In the following I give some brief data on the chiefdoms of six districts, following essentially the records of M. H. Löbner, Mission Superintendent of the Evangelical Brotherhood. The more detailed information about Mirambo (see under Urambo) is partly from the missionaries P. Terp and A. Seipt.  Ukimbu (in the south). The oldest chief known here is Mukuve. He had a daughter named Ikiva. One day a foreign chief's son, named Mulova, appeared and settled near the sultan's seat in Kipembabwe. Here he sowed a field with pumpkins, a crop that was still unknown there, and went away for a while. When he returned, he found all the pumpkins stolen, whereupon he declared war on Ukimbu. Only after Mukuve gave him his daughter Ikiva as his wife did he cease hostilities. Ukimbu was later often the scene of enemy incursions. The warlike Vangoni tribes came from the south. Later, the Vavungu appeared. They also had to fight with Bwana Mulwani of Tabora, probably an Arab or Arab hybrid. The war campaigns of the feared chief of Kiwere, Nungu, who extended his raids as far as Ukimbu, are also remembered. On one of them he had the chief of Kipembabwe killed and his head brought to Kiwere.  More recently, under the Wakimbu chief Tjandangombe, the Waloli raids took place under their conquering leaders Merere and Mugalula of Kiwere. Tjändangombe was poisoned in 1918. He was succeeded by his son of the same name. - Ukimbu, which used to form a relatively large empire and which at times even paid tribute to the lands of Kiwere and Ngulu far to the north, declined over the course of time due to wars and slave hunts and finally only had about 4000 inhabitants.  14*


Page 204

Kiwere. In older times, as already mentioned above, Kiwere was temporarily subject to tribute to the Wakimbu. Tradition records Ilasi or Mikono as the first known ruler. He was followed by Kapumpa, and then by Nungu, the most famous chief of Kiwere from historical times. Nungu was a sister's son of the chief Kijungi from Unjanjembe (see below). When his sister went blind one day, he accused his uncle Kijungi of sorcery and went on raids with his warriors. There was a blood friendship with the neighboring Ngulu. Several other chiefs, such as those of Vunankwila and Itumba, also became blood friends with Nungu in order to protect their countries from war. Nungu now turned to southern Kiwere, defeated and killed the local chief Kapumpa and all his children, took the ndesi (the chief's badge, consisting of a large, rare shell) himself and thus seized control of Kiwere by force. From here he waged war in all directions. He drove out the chief of Nkololo and installed his son as his successor. The Vujanzi landscape was devastated. In Kororomo, Nungu made his relative Luhamba chief. In Kavuje he made a name for himself by having the prisoners of war roasted alive. Rungwa and Ufipa in the far west were ravaged by him. In the south he ravaged the chiefdom of the Wakimbu, Kipembabwe (see above), Igunda and Ukangulu. To the east, Nungu extended his raids as far as Vujinga near Iringa, but was beaten back here by the brave Wahehe. He is even said to have waged war as far as Ugogo.  Nungu later built the sultan's seat of Igumila (Kiwere), which still exists today, where he died in 1885. He was succeeded by his sister's son Mugalula. He also waged war with Kipembabwe and Ukangulu in the south, but was otherwise popular with his subjects. After the death of Mwana Kijungi of Unjanjembe (see here), many of his relatives fled to the south and joined forces with the Wajinga (near Iringa) against Mugalula, but without being able to achieve anything. Shortly afterwards, however, Mugalula took his own life. - Since then, Msawila, the daughter of his sister, has ruled Kiwere.  Ugunda. The oldest known chief here was Meta. The land is enfeoffed from Ugalla with the chief's badge (ndesi or kilunga). One of Meta's successors, Sultana Ndizya, had to fight against the chiefs Muhalule and Mwana Kijungi (see under Unjan- jembe) and was defeated. The Sultana Meta has ruled since 1905.  Ngulu. At the time of Kijungi of Unjanjembe (see there) Madeleka, surnamed Muhalule, ruled Ngulu. He drove out his predecessor Malingo, who fled to Rungwa in the south. But as Muhalule feared that Malingo might return and take revenge on him, he joined forces with Nungu of Kiwere. The latter lured Malingo to his residence. There he was offered a chair that had been placed on a pit. When Malingo unsuspectingly sat down on it, he fell into the pit and was speared. Muhalule later conquered Sikonge, which until then had belonged to Ugunda. He died in 1901 and three of his sons ruled in quick succession after his death. The last of them died in 1910. The current chief is a younger brother of Muhalule and is called Mpagama.  Unjanjembe. The oldest known sultan here is Sewa Milundi. He was succeeded by his brother's son Kijungi, who made a name for himself with his bloody raids far to the south and west. Under his rule, many Arabs settled here with his consent.


Page 205

on the Kasehberg and founded the settlement of Tabora. Kijungi had well-trained warriors and a strongly fortified residence, so that even the universally victorious and feared chief Mirambo of Urambo was no match for him.  Kijungi was succeeded by his son Isike, usually called Mwana-Kijungi (son of Kijungi). He himself rarely went to war, but his sub-chiefs did. The ambitious Mirambo, this time supported by the conquest-addicted Nungu of Kiwere, also tried to defeat him. However, this time too he had to leave without having achieved anything. At the time of Isike, the first Germans arrived in the interior of the country and established the military station of Tabora. In his short-sighted, blind hatred of the foreign whites, he allowed himself to be tempted into chasing two of them away and taking their property as booty, which earned him a heavy fine. He continued to have friction with the Germans in the years that followed. One day, when a white man and one of his black soldiers were murdered in his residence, Captain von Prince had Isike's residence stormed and destroyed. Isike himself committed suicide by trying to blow himself up with gunpowder. His successor, Bibi Kalunde, died on March 23, 1917 and was succeeded by a coastal Negro named Saidi bin Msawila.  Urambo. Undoubtedly the best known and most powerful personality in Unjamwesi, and one can say without exaggeration in all of Central Africa, was Mirambo, which means "the corpses". His memory is still very much alive today in all parts of the country. But where people speak of him, they do so very quietly and with great reserve, as if they were afraid of invoking his spirit by mentioning his name. .  Mirambo was born as the eldest son of a small chief, Kasanda of Ujowa, in his residence Ikonongo between 1830 and 1840. He succeeded his father to the throne as a young man. In his irrepressible thirst for activity and conquest, however, his inherited kingdom soon became too small for him. First, the neighboring Ulyanhulu was conquered and its chief Kasele, his own relative on his father's side, was blinded. Now that he had smelled blood, he began a series of raids and conquests that were probably unparalleled in Central Africa in terms of ruthlessness, murder and bloodlust. First, he built himself a new, impregnable, fortress-like residence, Isela magazi (= stream of blood), in the newly conquered kingdom of Ulyanhulu. Contrary to the usual light construction of the Wanjamwesi, this castle was built of mud bricks, surrounded by several high ramparts, between each of which towered tall hedges of euphorbia, impenetrable because of their poisonous milky sap. Mirambo resided here with his harem, which according to some sources consisted of fifty, according to others even around three hundred women. It was from here that he undertook his war and raiding expeditions, through which he quickly made all the surrounding regions subject to tribute.  According to the older people who still knew Mirambo, as well as the first missionaries who founded a station in Urambo near the residence, Mirambo was of slender but handsome, sinewy build. His face, lighter in color than that of the usual Negroes, had a somewhat suffering expression. At the same time, he was extremely tough and had an indomitable strength of will, which all too often degenerated into cold-blooded cruelty. Despite his great wealth, Mirambo lived a spartan life. As a rule, he only ate porridge made from rice and maize flour and drank milk with it. 


Page 206

He hated and fought against the otherwise widespread consumption of Negro beer because it weakened the people, and he often imposed the death penalty if he caught his people drinking beer despite the ban. As a result of this simple, healthy lifestyle, Mirambo had great endurance in the face of hardship. His constant secret fear of assassination, which grew stronger the older he became, was striking. His inner chambers were therefore always protected by a security guard of a few tried and tested warriors. It was also said that he never slept at night because of this fear and always sat in front of all those present at court hearings and other gatherings.  Mirambo was particularly great as a general and as the creator and organizer of his troops. He soon realized that young, energetic and enthusiastic troops were best suited to the conquests. He therefore took only young, sometimes boyish soldiers with him on his military campaigns, leaving the older ones behind to protect the residence and the country. The warriors wore a red scarf as a badge and distinguishing mark and were feared almost more than their chief because of their lust for murder and robbery. Mirambo himself wore a red jacket and red turban in battle, with the kilinga (the large, white royal shell) on his chest as a sultan's badge. As a rule, he only took two of his wives, a cook and two tents with him on his campaigns, one for himself and one to cover the powder loads.  Before the start of a war, a war council was always held in the presence of the sub-chiefs and group leaders to discuss the order of march and plans of attack. This was followed by a military display with a war dance, during which several cattle were slaughtered and distributed. Mirambo was strict and tireless on the march and always at the forefront of the attack. His main tactic was to take the enemy settlements by surprise in the early morning, when everything was in the deepest, most careless sleep. In this way he seldom failed in his attacks.  The prisoners' lot was generally unenviable. Mirambo had some of the men cruelly murdered and the women were taken along as slaves. His warriors, on the other hand, had it good after a victorious battle. They danced and celebrated for seven days, eating and drinking excessively. Only then did they return home, richly laden with booty, to prepare for new deeds.  Mirambo's power and wealth grew with each passing year. The borders of his empire extended further and further on all sides. After three years of fighting, he finally defeated the herd-rich Vaha and Warundi at the northern end of Lake Tanganyika and brought back large herds of cattle as booty from there. In the north, the chiefdoms gradually became tributary to him as far as Lake Victoria Nyansa. One day he even took up arms against the powerful Sultan Mtesa of Uganda, allied with the warlike Vangoni. However, there was no battle. Mirambo, as a clever man, must have realized the hopelessness of his attempt and sent messengers to Mtesa's court to offer peace. They were brilliantly received and entertained by Mtesa and finally dismissed with rich gifts, consisting of sixty elephant teeth, fifty bark robes, twenty guns and thirty oxen.  During all these military campaigns, however, Mirambo did not fail to ensure the protection and security of his vast empire. For this


Page 207

For this purpose, he built regular forts on the borders, which he placed under the command of experienced leaders and sub-chiefs. Field service and battle exercises were held here daily to keep the warriors constantly in training. He also occasionally settled foreign tribes on the borders as a protective wall against enemy attacks and provided them with the necessary firearms. One day, so the story goes, he also had guns, powder and primers handed out to a newly settled tribe. However, as the people had not yet seen a gun and therefore did not know what to do with it, they smoked tobacco from it. When Mirambo heard this, he went to give them their first demonstration lesson in the use of firearms. Without further ado, he took a rifle, loaded it and shot down the first best one.  Mirambo fought his hardest battles with the Arabs. For five years he waged fierce wars against them and repeatedly attacked their trading and slave caravans. It is reported that the first cause of the hostilities was an Arab named Hamis, who is said to have made a derogatory remark about Mirambo while traveling through Mirambo's kingdom. This enraged the ambitious and easily irritated chief and he swore revenge on the Arabs. However, he still held his ground. Then a second circumstance arose that made Mirambo take up arms. One day, some Arab slaves escaped and went under Mirambo's protection. Their masters then sent messengers and demanded their extradition, but Mirambo refused. During the night, one of the messengers seduced Mirambo's favorite wife. The latter, offended in his excessive ambition, demanded satisfaction from the Arabs, but this was rejected with the scornful remark that she was only a black woman. Mirambo immediately had the war drums beaten. The Arabs, who did not feel equal to Mirambo's power, tried to appease him with gifts, but to no avail. The Arabs were defeated in a fierce five-day battle. Meanwhile, they received reinforcements from Tabora and gathered for a counterattack. While they were deliberating in the forest at night, Mirambo crept up and, sitting in a tree, overheard everything. And before the Arabs had even set off, they were ambushed by Mirambo's warriors and put to flight with heavy losses. Four Arabs and one hundred and twenty of their black warriors were left dead and the entire rich camp fell into Mirambo's hands. He chased after the fugitives as far as Tabora. Here they once again engaged in battle. During this battle, the Arab Hamis fell and fell into Mirambo's hands, badly wounded. No sooner had he recognized his mortal enemy than he had him killed, cut open by his medicine man and made ''dawa'', i.e. magic medicine, from his still twitching heart. The Arab settlement of Tabora was then plundered and rich booty was taken. It is reported that Mirambo carried off 500 elephant teeth, 200 loads of cotton cloth, 100 barrels of powder, 50 boxes of soap and much more. Although these figures may be exaggerated by the exaggeration of the Negroes, the fact remains that the Arabs suffered a heavy defeat at that time.  The Arabs tried several more times in the following years to avenge the disgrace they had suffered, but in vain. Finally, after five years, during which time the trading caravans had suffered heavily from the constant raids by Mirambo's warriors, the Sultan of Zanzibar asked Mirambo for peace, and Mirambo, himself tired of war, agreed to the request. As a gift of reconciliation, he sent a caravan with 100 elephant teeth to the coast. The people were welcomed by the


Page 208

Arabs and sent them back with rich gifts of precious materials, powder and primers, brass wire etc. in return. From then on, the Arabs' caravans could once again travel through Mirambo's empire unmolested.  Mirambo was generally not hostile towards the Europeans who were already appearing here and there in Unjamwesi. The London Missionary Society was able to set up a station near the main residence in Urambo and carry out its work without interference. And when one day, during a military campaign in Ugalla, a village was to be stormed in which a European and an Arab were camped, Mirambo had them warned in advance and asked them to leave. However, as they refused, they too were killed in the general slaughter, whereupon Mirambo, fearing that the matter could have dire consequences, sent 50 elephant teeth to Zanzibar as atonement. His tolerant attitude towards the whites was probably largely due to the fact that Mirambo was an intelligent and far-sighted man who foresaw and anticipated the coming of a new era long before his black contemporaries. He is even said to have prophetically predicted that white men would one day come from the east, from the coast, and take possession of the land. The extent to which this statement is based on fact remains to be seen.  Mirambo led his last campaign against Kapella of Ukuna. It was a stubborn battle. In addition, Mirambo had contracted a malignant venereal disease which weakened him greatly. Nevertheless, he would not give up the fight. With iron willpower he persevered until he was soon carried off by pneumonia. According to other reports, he was finally killed by his own warriors who, while he was sleeping in the hut, secretly put a noose around his neck, passed the rope through the wall of the hut to the outside and strangled him by forcibly tightening it. I have tried several times to find out whether the last version is true, but in vain, as the inhabitants of Urambo, who alone could have provided information on this, shyly avoided the subject.  It is only understandable that in the course of time a whole circle of legends and myths could form around such a personality, who was far above the ordinary level of the Negro. For example, it is said that Mirambo already had great plans as a boy. His ambition was to take on the warlike Wangoni who had come from the south. To this end, he moves south under a different name, stays on the border of Wangoniland and gets to know their language and customs. One day he goes to the residence and places himself at the disposal of the chief. Thanks to his great bravery and fearless courage, he soon becomes mutwale (commander). The chief even offers him the hand of his daughter in order to tie him to himself permanently. However, his apprenticeship comes to an end and Mirambo goes on his way again. Later, he actually came into contact with the Wangoni several times, sometimes as an ally, sometimes as a bitter opponent.  After Mirambo's death, the great empire disintegrated almost faster than it had been founded. His successor was Pandatjalo, his younger brother. He was soon wounded in battle and killed by his own men. He was succeeded by Katugamoto (firebrand), who was deposed in 1898 by Lieutenant v. Trotha and exiled to the coast because he was guilty of assaults against the German government. In his place, Kaswika mounted the now already


Page 209

The chieftain's chair of Ulyanhulu, which has become quite small and unsightly again.  The only visible traces of former greatness and power are the ruins of Mirambo's residence, Isela-magasi (stream of blood) and a huge fan palm tree near the Urambo mission station, which was fertilized with the blood of numerous executed people for years during Mirambo's time. The public place of execution was located here at the foot of the palm tree. And when Mirambo, the prince of corpses, merely nodded his head, his three executioners swung the axe.  V. The position of the Wanjamwesi among the other Negro tribes of East Africa and their economic importance.  The Wanjamwesi occupy an outstanding, leading position among the peoples of East Africa, both in terms of their external size and their physical and mental disposition. The Arabs had already recognized this. If they succeeded in extending their rule over the whole of East Africa deep into the Congo in just a few decades, they owed this in no small part to the help of the Wanjamwesi. In them they found a willing, persistent source of support and, above all, docile, intrepid helpers for military service and slave hunts. Even today, the memory of their courageous actions has not been extinguished among many Congo tribes. When the black regiments of the Belgians poured across German East Africa from the Congo and approached Unjamwesi in 1916, many of the black Askari (soldiers) expected armed and fierce resistance. They could therefore not express enough surprise at finding the feared Wanjamwesi as settled, peaceful farmers again; and again and again they were heard to say in amazement: so these are the Wanjamwesi! - After the power of the Arabs had been broken, the Wanjamwesi were among the first to adapt willingly and almost without resistance to the changed circumstances and to offer their services to the new rule as reliable, skillful porters and intelligent, persistent plantation workers. And when the initially foreign police and protection force began to be replaced more and more by locals, the Wanjamwesi again played a not unimportant role in terms of both numbers and aptitude.  One of the most remarkable traits that distinguishes them from all other peoples in East Africa is their wanderlust. The Munjamwesi is a born migrant and wanderer, the Saxonian of East Africa. The migration into the distance is in their blood. In February and March, when the main field work is done, the man can no longer stay at home. He then has to go away for a few months, even if it is only to visit one of his many relatives in a distant corner of the country. Most of the time, however, he is recruited for six to eight months on a plantation on the coast, or he takes on porter service for several months. I have met people who have made the 800 km or more journey on foot to the coast to Dar es Salaam, Bagamoyo and other port cities, carrying loads of 60-80 pounds on the way there and back. And a young man who had never been to the coast on foot, or had never been on a major safari (Karawan trip), did well to keep quiet in the men's group. Even at the age of eleven to twelve, the boy accompanies his father or uncle on the caravan journey to carry his food and sleeping mat; and as soon as he feels strong enough, he is over-


Page 210

he takes on a burden himself, adopts a sonorous safari name and now proudly calls himself Mpagasi, i.e. porter.  These frequent journeys were not without manifold repercussions on the spiritual development of the people, on economic life and on family relationships. The contact with the most diverse foreign tribes and races, the contact with other customs and traditions broadened the circle of vision and gave the Munjamwesi a certain mental agility that was pleasantly noticeable to every European. Experiences and observations gathered along the way were put to good use at home. To name but one, they liked to bring back seeds from foreign crops and trees to cultivate at home, and it was not uncommon to suddenly find oneself in front of an orchard with rare trees near a village settlement. Perhaps the example of the Arabs with their orchards also played a decisive role here. Today, for example, the mango tree is very strongly represented in places, especially in the central part of Unjamwesi, in the district of Tabora, where a large area of land is actually called Unjanjembe, the land of mango trees. In older books one often finds the translation "land of hoes"; but the word Unjanjembe must be translated according to its linguistic form as "land of mango trees". In Kinjamwesi the mango tree is called Muembe, plural Miembe, while the hoe is called Igembe, plural Magembe. Land of the hoe should therefore be called Unjamagembe in proper Kinjamwesi. Unjamjembe, as it should actually be pronounced, becomes Unjanjembe for ease of pronunciation. In addition, there is no factual justification for the translation "land of the hoes" because, as far as I know, the former indigenous hoes mainly came from the Ukonongo region in the southwest of Unjamwesi and from the northern Usukuma region. In contrast, the meaning "land of mango trees" is easy to understand, as the Unjanjembe landscape does indeed have many such trees, in places whole groups and groves. However, the name is probably of more recent origin as, according to the natives, in earlier times it was believed that anyone who planted a mango tree would die as soon as the tree bore its first fruit, and for this reason mango trees were rarely planted in the past. Finally, I would like to point out that Schnee's colonial lexicon also translates Unjanjembe as Land of Mango Trees.  However, I will show at a suitable point that the Wanjamwesi's Saxonization, despite its beneficial effect on economic life and the character of the people, cannot remain without a detrimental influence on family life.  Proof that the Wanjamwesi play an important role among the peoples of East Africa in terms of character and economy must also be seen in their colonizing ability, in their ability to quickly feel at home and take root even under the most foreign conditions thanks to their mental agility, their diligence and their peaceful attitude. Today, smaller and larger settlements and colonies of Wanjamwesi can be found in many parts of East Africa, not only in the former German colony, but especially in the northeast and towards the coast. Some of these are voluntary emigrants who have settled permanently with their families in the vicinity of a larger plantation; others are tribes that have been given permanent residence by the German government.


Page 211

were settled in former insurgency areas as a calming element. Such transplantations have proved successful everywhere; for, as I have said, the Munjamwesi is by nature an industrious, peace-loving cultivator and consequently a very useful colonizing element.  VI Social phenomena.  As has already been indicated several times in the preceding sections, the Wanjamwesi are not a uniform tribe or ethnic group, but a grouping of related tribes, which as a whole are so well characterized that they fully justify the common name. However, Unjamwesi only once had a solid state structure temporarily during Mirambo's reign of terror and plunder. Today it is politically divided into a number of independent and equal grand chiefdoms (vutemi), which are in turn subdivided into a myriad of subchiefdoms (magunguli). The major sultanates are in the west: Usumbwa, Ukumbi, Ugalla, Ukonongo; in the south: Ukimbu, Kiwere; in the east: Itumba, Ujansi, Ussongo; in the north: Ussukuma and Msalala; in the center: Unjanjembe, Ngulu and Ugunda. Closer contact only exists between these sultanates if the chiefs concerned are related or linked by blood friendship. Since the seizure of their lands by the Europeans, the rights and powers of the chiefs, who once ruled their lands sovereignly and often with unrestrained arbitrariness, have been severely restricted. In more recent times, a certain change has occurred insofar as the English have granted the great chiefs greater independence within certain limits at the expense of the sub-chiefs.  The dignity of the sub-chiefs (vanatjalo), like that of the grand sultans, is hereditary, but must be confirmed by the latter on accession. Apart from these ancestral sub-chiefs, so-called "Watwale" (army commanders) and "Wanangwa'", relatives of the Grand Sultan, can be found here and there in the country. They are appointed directly by the Grand Chief and form a certain counterweight to the land and hereditary 'Wanatjalo' (sub-chiefs). Usually a mutwale or mwanangwa is in charge of several magunguli (sub-chiefdoms) and keeps his master constantly informed about everything that is going on in the country. The peculiar thing about this is that the Watwale are exclusively the slaves of the grand chief.  The most cohesive character is shown by the village associations, which are mainly formed from the family clans with their serfs. The term village association (ikaja), which is perhaps not the best choice, refers to individual villages or settlements, which today are on average quite small and may have 6, 8, 15 or 20 huts. The settlements on the main roads with markets and the chiefdoms are an exception, and their populations are therefore usually more or less randomly composed.  Family clans are the descendants of a common ancestor, consisting of the elder brother as the village elder (Musengakaja - village farmer) with his wives and direct descendants, the younger brothers with their families and any dependants. All married adults have separate households, including the individual wives of a man and the married dependants. 


Page 212

The village association is called ikaja, the clan igongo, the inhabitants of a house, i.e. the immediate family, ivanza. The term ivanza is also used for the food community on caravan journeys.  In the past, the settlements were usually fortified with rectangular tembenas, palisades or living hedges, mostly euphorbia, whereas today they are open and unprotected.  At the head of the village association is the village chief (Musenga- kaja), who is very often also a medicine man and thus has a dual role as a social and religious leader. Under the influence of modern times, the former unity of the village associations is becoming more and more loosened, which is expressed outwardly in the fact that today one encounters fewer and fewer large and firmly fenced settlements, since the new conditions on the one hand favor a certain disintegration of the traditional clan authority and on the other hand the need for protection is considerably reduced by the suppression of tribal feuds. Only on the fringes of the larger steppes and forests can one still see the palisaded village for protection against predators.  Slavery is one of the main manifestations of social life, as is common in Africa, including among the Wanjamwesi. However, it is characteristic of the way it appears in public life that I have lived in Unjamwesi for several years without discovering any actual trace of slavery, although it is widespread. This is because slavery in the common sense does not exist in Unjamwesi today. Rather, we are dealing here with a kind of bondage that can hardly be compared in its social effects with the serfdom of our former farmers. Even the term slave (musese) is very rarely used. Instead, the owner speaks only of his "children"; and everywhere there is a community of food between masters and serfs. It is also not uncommon for a slave to be adopted as a child over time and to be completely absorbed into the family of the former master. Moreover, today the children of bondmen are considered freeborn. Of course, it is not impossible, and there is much to suggest, that in earlier times bondage was much harsher than it is today. But as things stand at present, there is hardly any reason to press for the abolition of bondage as quickly as possible. In most cases, the bonded servants themselves do not even want it, because they do not perceive their social dependence as something inferior or oppressive; on the contrary, they know that they are borrowed and cared for in this way. For, according to the general view, the owner has the duty to care for his bonded servant in cases of old age, illness and incapacity to work as he would for a family member. This is the only explanation for the fact that relatively little use was made of the opportunity given by the German government of the time to buy oneself free, indeed that a freehold was often perceived as a disgrace, as being cast out of the cherished family circle.  The majority of today's bondmen come from earlier wars and slave hunts and are therefore largely foreign. The Congolese provided the largest percentage at the time. The sultans were an exception in that they had always been happy to supplement their large stock of serfs from their own subjects. To this end, they had drawn up a series of often downright ridiculous taboo laws, the violation of which was enough to turn a free man into a slave; for example, touching the floor in the courtyard of the chief's palace.


Page 213

The latter included the skull tree erected in the chief's residence, or the unauthorized touching of a slain lion or leopard. It also happened, however, that criminals or otherwise persecuted people voluntarily put themselves into the slavery of the chief by fleeing to the residence and touching one of the above-mentioned sacred objects in order to escape their persecutors in this way. In the open space of the chief's residence (ikulu), the skull tree still stands everywhere today as the first visible symbol of chieftainship. It is a pole two to three meters high, forked several times, from whose branches hang the bleached skulls of lions, leopards and other larger predators, as well as large rare birds. I did not see any human skulls among them. This skull tree was and still is considered taboo for the common subject and may not be touched with impunity. Anyone who touched it in the past, whether intentionally or unintentionally, forfeited his freedom and became a slave of the chief. The same applied to the lion and leopard skins hung on the fence of the courtyard or on the wall of the hut. Anyone who had killed a lion or leopard or caught one in a trap had to inform the next sub-chief immediately, who then had his hunter kill the predator and take the hide to the chief of the land. Today, these prohibitions are only observed by the older inhabitants of the remote forest areas.  According to current regulations, slaves may no longer be bought and sold, but they still change hands. Incidentally, each slave has his own household. He is only obliged to help his master with sowing and harvesting during the main work periods and to lend a hand with hut building and other larger jobs. All in all, slavery among the Wanjamwesi today is a very mild form of bondage which has very little in common with the common concept of slavery and which will slowly disappear of its own accord as contact with European civilization progresses.  VII Marriage and family life.  In principle, polygamy prevails among the Wanjamwesi. If a large proportion of the men nevertheless live with only one wife, the reason is almost exclusively that they are too poor to take a second and a third; for since marriage is connected with the deposit of a relatively high morning gift, only the wealthy can allow themselves the comfort and luxury of several wives. In practice, therefore, polygamy only exists among the great sultans, sub-chiefs, village owners and a small number of economically better-off natives. All others are content with one legitimate wife, even if they usually also have a so-called muhala (ratio). There is no upper limit to the number of women. I was assured by Sultan Saidi bin Msawila of Unjanjembe in 1920 that his harem numbered over a hundred. The smaller chiefs are content with three to four, the village owners usually with two to three wives. But there are also exceptions. For example, I met a small village owner near Usoke station near Tabora who had the impressive number of seven wives.  Polygamy is deeply rooted in the social and economic conditions here and is considered normal in the eyes of the natives. It is not unusual, for example, for the wife herself to advise her husband to have a


Page 214

second marriage, be it out of concern for the offspring, because she has to breastfeed her child for one and a half to two years due to a lack of artificial nutrition; be it because of illness or for other reasons. Then there is the economic aspect. Hoeing requires a lot of energy and is mainly done by women. And finally, to mention just one more thing, the number of women is a measure of the wealth of the Munjamwesi and is also a main indicator of social rank. Each of the polygamist's wives has her own hut and household. Sometimes they also live in different villages. In general, the status of women among the Wanjamwesi is not as low and oppressed as it is among other indigenous peoples. I even got to know some families in which the woman definitely had the spiritual upper hand and ruled with a firm hand. It cannot be ruled out that the many and prolonged absences of the men on caravan journeys, plantations etc. had a favorable influence on the development of women's independence and a certain degree of freedom. In any case, the woman is given the opportunity to exert herself within certain limits and to maintain a certain degree of independence.  As a rule, the Wanjamwesi marry at the age of 14 to 16. I was assured that there is the possibility of a trial marriage, but I could not find out anything certain about this. In any case, free sexual intercourse among the boys before marriage is quite common and no particular value is placed on the bride's virginity. Child marriages are not the order of the day, but they do occur occasionally. In this case, however, the girl remains with her mother until she becomes a man. I also observed the existence of levirate marriages in the south, in Kiwere.  The main role in the marriage is played by the mukombe (= matchmaker), usually a relative of the man's family. His task is to initiate and complete the negotiations with the bride's family, which often takes months. If the young man has chosen a girl and she meets with the approval of the family, the mukombe first brings a gift worth about five rupees, consisting of clothes, a goat and the like. If the gift is accepted, it means that the girl's family is prepared to negotiate. The next step is to agree on the amount of the bride price, which involves a great deal of eloquence on both sides. The amount of the bride price varies greatly and depends mainly on the social status of the bride's family, but also to a certain extent on the skill of the mukombe in the marriage negotiations. As a rule, it varies between forty and one hundred marks. In exceptional cases, however, morning gifts worth between one hundred and fifty and one hundred and eighty marks are also paid. Whereas in the past payment was made exclusively in kind (cattle, goats, iron hoes, clothing fabrics, etc.) or with slaves, today the compensation is often made in cash. The family clan is responsible for collecting the bride price. The frequently used expressions: Purchase price for morning gift and purchase marriage are not appropriate from the point of view of the Munjamwesi, even if they are generally used for this type of marriage and the bride price does indeed justify the concept of a change of ownership to a certain extent. But it is characteristic of people's perception and way of thinking that they take the position of treating their wives like any other object.


Page 215

They, for their part, find it quite incomprehensible that the white man gets his wife for nothing, so to speak, and that the latter even brings a certain amount of property with her into the marriage. According to the Munjamwesi view, the value of the woman increases with the amount of the dowry paid, and one can generally hear the assertion: Women for whom we do not have to pay anything have no value in our eyes, they are common property, public women.  The wedding is celebrated with a big drum dance festival (ngoma) in which all the surrounding villages take part. On the evening before the wedding, the groom goes to the bride's village with his friends. As a pretense, he is denied entry with sticks and spears. Only when he has paid a small gift worth about one mark to the bride's family is he allowed in. The dancing of the party participants then begins. That night, the young man sleeps with the bride, while his friends spend the night with the bride's playmates in the girls' house. As I have often observed, the young men always appear with slight skin wounds on their faces after this night. I have not been able to find out who gives them these and what custom they are due to. After the wedding, the young man has to stay in his father-in-law's village for a while, often up to a year, and help him with all the work. This is a kind of trial period during which the young husband is supposed to show whether he is capable of supporting a wife. It is also customary for the son-in-law to meet his father-in-law on the threshold of the hut early in the morning for the first three or four days after the wedding and to greet him in a detailed, ceremonial manner when he comes out. Mention should also be made here of the existence of the father-in-law and mother-in-law taboo in the form that the young woman must always turn her back on her father-in-law when she greets him or speaks to him, and the man must behave in the same way towards his mother-in-law.  Divorces are quite common, especially in the early years of marriage. They make up the largest percentage of the many disputes and peace court hearings that are a daily occurrence in Munjamwesi. Valid reasons for divorce are: permanent dislike on the part of one party, childlessness, abuse on the part of the husband, adultery on the part of the wife and infection by syphilis and other venereal diseases. After endless negotiations, the Council of Elders decides whether or not the morning gift is to be repaid in the event of divorce. The decisive factor here is whether the man or the woman is the guilty party. If, for example, the husband has caused his wife to leave the house through continued abuse or has made her sexually ill, the marriage property will not be returned. However, if it is proven that the wife has given just cause for divorce, the bride price must be returned. In most cases, the husband's family will even hand over a detailed account of all the money spent on clothes, jewelry, etc. during the marriage. If there are children, they are usually awarded to the man in the divorce in return for renouncing part or all of the marriage property. Adultery on the part of the wife - there is practically no adultery on the part of the husband - does not always lead to divorce, because only in the rarest of cases does the Munjamwesi regard adultery as an infringement of his personal honor. In many cases, therefore, he is only too happy to settle for the relatively high fine that the married man caught in flagrante delicto has to pay.


Page 216

to pay for the breach. He does not hold the misstep against his wife in any way. The following little experience I had in 1917 is indicative of the Munjamwesi's view on this point. I was traveling from Urambo to Usoke. After we had been on the road for a day, it turned out that two porters were superfluous and could be sent back the next day. They immediately devised a plan to surprise the wife of one of them at night, as they must have known that she secretly had a lover. The gallant was not to be beaten up, however, but only caught in flagrante delicto so that he could be forced to pay the highest possible fine.  The wanderlust of the Wanjamwesi mentioned above, which keeps the young, strong men away from home and farm for months at a time year after year, is very damaging to family life. The next natural consequence is that the women become involved with other men in the meantime, which leads to quarrels and protracted disputes when the man returns. The second consequence is that the men often return home with venereal diseases and infect their previously healthy wives. In any case, the material successes of the Saxons' lifestyle did not outweigh the damage to family relationships and thus to the people as a whole.  The high infant mortality rate among the Wanjamwesi is probably also a consequence of the contamination by the men returning from the coast, even if the wrong diet must also be held responsible for this. From the very first day, the children are fed with hard-to-digest porridges made from maize and millet flour, with the result that a large proportion perish from stomach and intestinal disorders and the survivors walk around with noticeably fat, distended bellies until they are five or six years old.  As far as I know, prostitution in the sense of the term developed in European culture does not exist among the Wanjamwesi. I only have rural conditions in mind. In the towns, such as Tabora, and the larger market towns, contact with Europeans and Asians in recent decades may have led to the development of customs that come close to our concept of prostitution. However, the mixture of peoples and races here is usually so strong and the Wanjamwesi people among them are in such a minority and, moreover, so alienated from their original customs that the population of the towns is excluded from the assessment of this question. It is true that in the country there are unmarried women, widows, slaves etc. in almost every village and larger settlement who are available to men for extra-marital sexual intercourse in return for payment, and as already mentioned above, there is also generally free sexual intercourse among the unmarried youth; however, the main characteristic of prostitution is missing, namely that the women are forced to give themselves to the men for some reason, for reasons of greed or profit. Moreover, there is no perception of dishonor with regard to the women for sale, even if they are not exactly regarded as morally full. In addition, intercourse with these women very often takes the form of a temporary, albeit loose, marriage relationship. This is true, for example, in all cases where the poorer man has to interrupt sexual intercourse with his wife, whether because of her illness or pregnancy, or because she is supporting a child, and he does not have the necessary property to marry a second wife in a legally valid form.

Customs and traditions of both births.  The presence of the father or other men is not permitted during the birth. Only the midwife and a few experienced old women are present. The newborn is cut off with the help of a sharp spike torn from a deer stalk. The midwife carries the placenta to a crossroads at night and buries it there. The child is given its first name (lina lja homba = baby name) by the mother or her relatives or by the midwife. It is either borrowed from the circle of relatives or acquaintances or taken from the circumstances at the time (famine, war, etc.). For example, if a lion roars nearby during the birth, the boy is often called Simba (= lion). If the birth takes place at night, the newborn is often given the name Tschavusiku (the nocturnal one). If the child is born with the use of medicine, the boy is called Maganga (from Vu- ganga - medicine), the girl Musisja (from kusisja - to save or heal someone). A breech birth bears the name Kasindje (= foot or breech birth) as a permanent reminder of its improper entry into the world. This first name is sacred in a certain sense, which is why the Munjamwesi later, when he has grown up, adopts a different name at every opportunity. No man, for example, when he goes on a journey or is recruited by a European for some work, will give his original name, but will always adopt a new one. As a result, individuals often have four, five or more different names.  While the midwife bathes the child after a happy birth, it is greeted with cries of joy and trills by the neighboring women who have gathered in the meantime. After the bath, in some areas the newborn is given some honey from a local honey ant as its first food. Only after four to five days is the child carried out of the hut for the first time. At the door, the mother, the child, the midwife and the girl carrying the child are smeared with mula (= excrement from the giant snake, python). They then go to a crossroads with seeds of all the common cereals and pulses. A girl with a child on her back draws a furrow with a hoe, throws the seeds into it and covers it with earth again. At the end of this ceremony, the participants make an offering consisting of a thin flour porridge and then smear their foreheads, shoulders and chests with the porridge. According to missionary Fr. Terp, the boy is given a bow and arrow at birth. The grandfather or another older man from the family gives the following speech: 'My child, grow big and strong, cut down trees like an elephant, build houses, cultivate your fields, go to work and earn a lot of money. Marry an honorable woman. Do not become lazy, but prove yourself to be a useful, hard-working man." The girl is given a broom, cooking pot and mixing spoon, and an older woman says: "My child, stay healthy and become industrious. Marry a good man, keep your house in order, don't be bad, but prove yourself to be a proper, useful woman.  When twins are born, the chief of the district receives a gift worth up to thirty marks. In the past, twins were often killed for this reason. The birth of twins must be reported to the chief immediately. In some areas, the big chief's drum is then fetched for a rental fee of about five marks and a dance celebration is held in the village of the twins. According to Zeitschrift für Ethnologie. Vol. 1927/28. p. 3/6. 15


Page 218

At the end of the ceremony, the drum is returned. The drum is returned and the customary gift is paid to the ruler. One day in the village of the sub-chief Kandigiri of Ujumbu near Tabora, I happened to witness a celebration on the occasion of the birth of twins. At first there were negotiations about the amount of the gift to be paid. As far as I remember, they agreed on fifteen iron hoes (worth about 20 M.). As soon as the deal was concluded, the family appeared with the twins, trilling and shouting with joy, and gathered in front of the chief's house. Then the chief, adorned with the badge of rank (broad lion skin stripes studded with large white shells), came and, as the highest priest of the land, offered a sacrifice. A thin flour paste was mixed in a shallow calabash bowl, with which the chief sprinkled the celebrants while invoking the spirits. The sprinkling was not done with a bunch of green leaves as usual, but the priest repeatedly dipped the fingertips of his right hand into the flour paste, pressed them against the inside of his thumb and then spread them out so that the paste splashed in all directions.  Albinos, which are occasionally found, are respected as abortions and are accepted as a necessary evil. I was unable to find out whether they were killed in the past. They are generally regarded as a punishment from the evil spirits.  VIII. The material possessions of the Wanjamwesi. Village facilities and hut building.  While today one generally encounters smaller, open village settlements, the Wanjamwesi used to live in larger, enclosed settlements. The villages were either fenced in with high palisades or surrounded by a dense spurge hedge. In the south (Ukonongo, Ukimbu, Kiwere) the tembe form prevailed and still prevails today, i.e. the villages are surrounded in a large square by a closed row of mud houses, which have the shape of a goods wagon and are covered with a flat, slightly arched roof or one that slopes slightly on two sides. The tembe is about two to three meters high and up to three meters deep and only opens towards the inside of the village. The walls are made of wattle and daub, the roof consists of a thirty to forty centimeter thick layer of rammed earth resting on a base of cross timbers and straw. There are a number of round huts within the temple square. New temb villages are hardly ever built today because, on the one hand, the need for protection no longer exists to the same extent as in the times of the ongoing tribal feuds and, on the other hand, the cylinder hut is much quicker and easier to erect than the relatively massive tembe, which required a lot of heavier timber to build.  Today, palisaded villages can only be found in the pronounced forest areas and on the edge of the forests and steppes, where one must always reckon with nocturnal raids by predators. In the open, cultivated land, people are content with fences of corn and millet stalks about two meters high, which only enclose the individual farmsteads and groups of huts in the village. The center of the village is formed by the village tree, usually a broadly spreading ficus species, more recently also rubber trees. There is an open space around the tree, on which there is usually a slightly covered open hall. This is where public life takes place, where court hearings and other palaver take place, as well as dance parties. As soon as the sun goes down


Page 219

The inevitable fire is lit under the village tree, which both provides lighting and serves as a source of warmth for the freezing Negro.  As quickly and easily as a village settlement is founded, it can also disappear and be abandoned. It is striking how quickly they change their location. Traces of abandoned villages can be found everywhere in the steppe and forest. Settlements that were recorded on a route survey ten to twelve years ago are often found in vain today. The reasons for this rapid change are as follows: Infertility of the fields, plagues of predators, oppression by the chiefs and fear of spells. In my experience, the latter reason plays a particularly important role. For example, it is enough for several illnesses or deaths to occur in quick succession to cause the entire population of the village to leave the settlement within a few days. I will go into this point in more detail below in the section on religion.  The work of building a house is essentially the responsibility of the man. He cuts the wood and gathers the grass for the roof, with the woman only helping occasionally. Only when the shell of the hut is finished does the woman take over. She lays the floor of rammed earth and seals the wattle and daub of the walls with clay. The latter is provided by the nearest termite mound. If the clay is too thick, which is usually the case, it is mixed with a little sand. The top of the conical roof is almost always adorned with a tuft of thorns to prevent the eared owl from settling on it at night, as the owl is generally regarded as the wizard's companion). In many cases, a second wall is built concentrically around the actual cylinder wall to close off the overhanging roof. The resulting rooms serve partly as pantries and partly as sleeping areas for the older children and guests. The lifespan of such a round hut is normally ten to twelve years. However, it is often destroyed by termites before then.  Akerbauund Viehzudt.  Throughout Unjamwesi, agriculture plays a major role in the diet and the Wanjamwesi are generally regarded as hard-working, successful farmers. If, despite this, the yields from field cultivation are only moderate, sometimes even quite meagre, this is partly due to the inefficient soil cultivation, which is carried out everywhere as hoeing without any fertilization, but mainly due to the natural infertility of the soil, which here consists of a more or less coarse weathered layer of granite and gneiss with a very thin layer of humus. Small alluvial areas are only occasionally encountered. The third factor is the country's lack of water, as Unjamwesi is a highland with a pronounced steppe character and an average annual rainfall of 780 mm, which is only distributed over a few months of the rainy season. The consequence of these unfavorable conditions is that the individual has to cultivate a relatively large area in order to satisfy his food needs and is repeatedly forced, usually after only three or four years, to 1) I have no record of how the Munjamwesi thinks of the relationship between the owl and the wizard in detail. I only remember the saying 'where the owl sits (at night), the wizard is not far away'. This is probably based on a similar view to that of the hyena, which, according to the Negroes, is tamed by the sorcerers and used as a mount during nocturnal forays. 15*

to leave the fields fallow and clear a new piece of bush or forest. It is therefore rare to find areas of forest that still retain their original character. Everywhere you go, you come across traces of former farming. The fallow fields, for their part, turn back into dense bush within a few years, which soon turns into young forest.  The old, abandoned village squares (Itongo) are very popular and sought after, as they are true islands of fertility in the middle of the barren fields. Maize, millet and all other crops thrive here in lush abundance; and these "matongo" provide the best proof that fertilization can still produce good results. The many termite mounds of Termes bellicosus scattered throughout the country also play a not insignificant role. These mounds are usually two to three meters high and five to six meters wide at the base and consist entirely of solid, calcareous clay. Every year, the clay is washed away on all sides by the heavy thunderstorms of the rainy season, so that a fertile zone, albeit relatively small, is created around each mound. I have therefore often seen fierce disputes arise over the ownership of a termite mound (kigulu). As little as it would occur to a Negro to collect the manure from his cattle and bring it to the nearby field, he would never think of removing a termite mound and improving his field with the clay obtained. I had them do it once at my expense and they were all delighted with the success. However, no one did it again.  The main crops are sorghum and maize. They also grow: penieillaria, pulses (except peas, which do not thrive here), batatas, cassava, pumpkins and peanuts. In recent decades, manioc has become a staple food in some areas because it is easy to grow and always produces fairly good yields.  The work of cultivating the fields is done jointly by men and women, with the man doing the heavier work. He prepares the field, i.e. clears the bushes that keep breaking through and makes the furrows with a hoe. The woman then lays the seed and covers the furrows. Sowing is exclusively women's work because, according to the Wanjamwesi, this is the only way to ensure fertility. Harvesting is also done by the women. The maize is carried home in cobs, dried in the sun and then stored in large bark baskets, which are sealed at the top with clay. The millet is threshed on the spot with long, strong whips. The threshing floor is a poorly leveled loamy area on a termite mound, which is doused with water, tamped down and finally coated with cow dung.  Livestock farming plays only a minor role. It is essentially limited to goats, long-tailed sheep, chickens and pigeons. In some areas, the short-horned humped cattle are also kept, but especially in the north (Unjanjembe, Usukuma), their care is left to the Wahumah herders who have immigrated from Uha, Urundi and Rwanda. Owning cattle is a desirable goal for everyone, and anyone who owns eight to ten head is considered a wealthy man. As far as the origin of the livestock is concerned, with the exception of the semi-wild, jackal-like dog, all of them were probably imported from abroad at one time or another. Despite their excellent economic qualities, the Vanya-


Page 221

mwesi did not manage to domesticate domestic animals independently, even though they would have had valuable material at their disposal from the rich wild stocks. For example, I will only mention the elephant, the zebra, the magnificent, pristine wild cattle, the Cape buffalo, the eland and, among the small animals, the guinea fowl.  Other livelihoods.  Apart from agriculture and cattle breeding, the main occupations are porterage and work on the European plantations, which, as mentioned above, are practiced extensively by the Wanjamwesi. Even though most of the earnings flow into the hands of the exploitative Indian merchants who live all over East Africa, they still earn the money they need to pay taxes and provide themselves and their families with clothing. There are also small beginnings of industry. In Ukonongo, for example, there are whole villages of iron smelters and blacksmiths who produce arrowheads, spears and, above all, hoes. Before the introduction of money by the Europeans, these hoes were a common means of payment, with one hoe being worth between 1.50 and 2 million. The hoes were brought to all parts of the country by traders and exchanged for other local products. In Usumbwa, the soapstone found there is processed into stone pipes (Nkwisi). In every district there are large and small potteries where women make cooking pots and the popular, large beer pots. I would also like to mention the wickerwork, which is of outstanding quality and beauty, especially in Ugalla. Finally, I would like to mention the wood industry, which supplies bedsteads, stools, bark baskets (for storing harvest provisions), etc.  While fishing is only of minor importance due to the lack of lakes and larger permanent rivers, hunting for large and small game is relatively widespread everywhere, especially in the forest areas; and in many areas it almost exclusively supplies the popular and sought-after meat. The European hunting laws also try to restrict the shooting of game by the natives and therefore only issue hunting licenses to a few hunters in each district, but on the one hand it is very difficult to control hunting in the vast areas, and on the other hand the abundance of small game, which is not covered by the hunting law, is so great and varied that the natives still get their money's worth. Big game such as giraffes and the various species of antelope are shot in trapping pits and with falling spears. The former are set up in such a way that a kind of fence is run through wide stretches of forest, in which narrow gaps are left at intervals of about 100 meters. The pits are created in these gaps at right angles to the fence. They are about 2 m deep, three quarters to one meter wide at the top and are covered with straw and leaves and veneered with earth. Pointed stakes are often driven into the bottom of the pit. The spears are clumsy, heavy spears with a long shaft made of hardwood that ends in a kind of club at the top. They are hung between two trees over a fresh game kill and fitted with a thin, hard-to-see pull-off cord. The tip of the spear is usually coated with an effective muscle poison, so that even game that is only lightly hit falls in a short time. For medium-sized game (gazelles, bushbucks, dwarf antelopes, etc.), snares are preferably used which are connected to a quick-action tree. Small game


Page 222

such as hares and the smallest dwarf antelopes are caught with beaters. In some places, common hunts are also organized, whereby the game is driven into nets and shot with clubs. In Kiwere, in the south, the wild boar were hunted with packs of dogs and the individual animals were speared as soon as they were caught by the dogs. - Chicken-killing is a peculiar form of hunting that takes place every year in the second half of the dry season (August to October), when the big grass fires are over. In pitch darkness, the chicken hunters head out into the forest steppes armed with grass torches and clubs (hardwood sticks about one to one and a half meters long, hardened in the fire and bent at the thick end like golf clubs). The wild fowl (francolins etc.) are startled and blinded by the glow of the fire and can thus be easily shot with some skill. On one such night hunt, which I once joined, the guide brought down about two dozen francolins. However, there are said to be hunters who manage 60 or 70 in one night. Finally, there is the porcupine hunt, which is only practiced by the initiated porcupine hunters and which I have already reported on in detail elsewhere (issue 1/2 of this magazine p. 63). Elephant hunting, which used to be practiced extensively in Unjamwesi by special professional hunters, has almost completely ceased today, as the elephant population has declined sharply and hunting with the less effective muzzle loaders is always a dangerous business.  Food and stimulants.  The Wanjamwesi live mainly on plant foods, although meat is also a highly sought-after food and is eaten in enormous quantities wherever the opportunity arises. The basis of the daily diet is 'ugali', a solid bread-like porridge made from maize, millet or manioc flour, which is eaten two to three times a day depending on the available supplies. Various spinach, some of which grows wild, pulses, mushrooms, occasionally roasted locusts and termites in the rainy season, as well as fish and other meat, but only occasionally. Meals are eaten separately by the sexes, and as a rule small eating communities are formed, consisting of three or four neighboring families. The individual women of the families always take turns cooking. The Munjamwesi loves these eating communities because, as he says, he gets to eat more often this way, three times instead of once or twice at most. The sexes are strictly separated at mealtimes. The men and older boys eat first and the women and girls get the rest. Great attention is paid to cleanliness at mealtimes. Each participant rinses their mouth before and after the meal, and hands are washed before and after by a younger member of the eating community pouring water from a calabash over each participant's hands. Eating utensils such as spoons and the like are not known. Everyone takes a piece of ugali with their right hand, presses a depression into it with their thumb and uses it to scoop some food from the second bowl. Unripe maize cobs roasted on an open fire and fresh and boiled peanuts are very popular snacks, especially at harvest time.  Negro beer, which is consumed in large quantities all year round and is considered an indispensable foodstuff, plays a major role. The production of this beer is the sole responsibility of the


Page 223

A woman who takes pride in making the tastiest beer possible. They use different types of millet for this. Negro beer only has an intoxicating effect when consumed in large quantities; only beer mixed with honey (kangalla), a type of mead, is said to have a significantly stronger effect. Other stimulants include tobacco and hemp (canabis indica). Tobacco, which is grown everywhere, is mainly used as snuff. Only the older people, especially the women, smoke it from pipes, namely from the stone pipes that come from Usumbwa in the north and are made there from bacon stone. I have only occasionally noticed the tobacco being chewed. The hemp is smoked from water pipes whose water container is made from a gourd. The consumption of hemp is widespread in some places and, due to its strong narcotic effect, contributes greatly to the damage to public health.  "Clothing and dirt.  The original clothing of the Wanjamwesi, which consisted of makeshift tanned game skins and bark cloth, has now generally been replaced by European cotton fabrics. The men wear a loincloth which is wrapped around the hips and then rolled up several times from the top downwards, creating a kind of bead which is also used to hold smaller utensils such as snuff containers etc. A second piece of cotton cloth is wrapped around the hips. They cover their upper body with a second piece of cotton cloth by tying the two ends of one long side together over the right shoulder so that the left shoulder and arm remain free. In many cases, kaki suits are already in use. The most important and indispensable piece of clothing for women consists of a string of thick glass beads wrapped around the hips, from which the pubic cloth hangs in front. The loincloth is worn over this, as with men. The upper body is covered by a larger piece of cotton fabric, preferably with a colorful pattern, which reaches just under the armpits and is held in place by being rolled up several times. When doing housework, they usually take off the outer garment; the chest is also uncovered when mourning. While the boy walks around completely naked until the age of 8, the girl wears a small, square beaded apron hanging from a string of beads until she reaches manhood.  Among the disfigurements of the male body are the chipping or filing out of the upper central incisors in a triangular shape and, in the case of women, the piercing of the earlobes. It seems, however, that the latter is more recent and is a consequence of contact with coastal women who have converted to Islam. Men and women also wear two parallel ornamental scars on both sides from the temples downwards as a tribal insignia. It should also be mentioned in this connection that many have a small scar above the root of the nose; and it was interesting to me to note that this scar is the result of a kind of smallpox vaccination which, as older people assured me, has been practiced in Unjamwesi since early times. The vaccination is carried out in such a way that during epidemics some pus from smallpox patients is put into the fresh wound. The fact that this vaccination custom must be of older date is evident from the fact that I also noticed the scars on old people who assured me that they had already been vaccinated as small children.  In general, little attention is paid to hairstyle. Both sexes shave their hair at certain intervals.


Page 224

They cut the hair off at intervals, using an ordinary knife or, in the absence of a knife, a piece of broken glass. Younger dandies often leave a small tuft of hair in one or more places. Recently, women have adopted the coastal custom of letting their hair grow and braiding it into many small plaits that run parallel from the forehead to the back and rest firmly on the scalp. Although this new fashion contributes significantly to giving women a more pleasing appearance, it also provides a welcome shelter for all kinds of vermin and therefore cannot be seen as progress in terms of cleanliness. Since the styling and braiding of the hair is quite laborious and relatively expensive, the hairstyle is only renewed every 10 to 14 days.  Women's main adornment consists of large, colorful glass beads, which are worn on strings around the neck and wrists. In addition, in some districts, especially near Tabora and the Midland Railway, ear discs are made from colorful strips of paper. Thin copper wire rings are often worn around the ankles. These rings (fiomes) have an inlay of hair around which the thin wire is wound in tight coils. The other rings and various appendages worn by men and women are all amulets, defensive charms, wishing charms, etc., which are all described with the word "dawa" or "vuganga", i.e. medicine. Smaller children in particular are adorned with amulets to protect them against all kinds of illnesses, but above all as a defense against enchantment.  Weapons.  It is in keeping with the peace-loving, sedentary nature of the Wanjamwesi that their weaponry no longer plays a special role. It is mainly limited to the bow, a simple throwing spear and the short throwing club. The Arabs brought them firearms, so that today the muzzle-loader is quite common. For many, however, having an old muzzle loader or even a flintlock rifle in the hut is only a kind of tranquilizer, because the old, poorly maintained rifles, which have often not been used for years, can at most be dangerous to the owner himself. The bow is generally 160 cm long and is carved from a hardwood called mukoma. It consists of one piece that is thickest in the middle and tapers evenly on both sides. The string, twisted from the skin of the dwarf antelope or cattle lichen, is attached to the ends of the bow by wrapping and tying. To make the wood of the bow hard and elastic, it is wrapped with green banana bast before processing and held in a rotating motion over a charcoal fire until the bast is completely charred. The arrows are about 75-80 cm long and have iron tips with barbs behind the blade. Arrows with hardwood tips are also used, mainly for hunting feathered game. Poisoning the arrowheads is only rarely used today. The javelin consists of a blade about 45 cm long and 4-5 cm wide, which is attached to the shaft by means of a socket. The latter is about 150 cm long and has a short iron shoe at the lower end. The iron used for the spears and arrowheads, smelted and forged in the country itself, is relatively soft and quite worthless from a weaponry point of view. The throwing


Page 225

The mace is carved from heavy wood, mainly ebony, and is about 110 cm long. Shields may have been used in wars in the past, but today they are no longer seen even at festivities.  IX. The spiritual possessions of the Wanjamwesi.  The main areas in which the spiritual life of the Wanjamwesi is reflected are: their religion, fairy tales and animal fables, proverbs, riddles and songs. In the following, I will first try to give a brief summary of the religious phenomena. This will be followed by a number of typical fairy tales as I recorded them on the spot at the time, including two in the original language with translations that are as literal as possible. The other three sections contain a selection of proverbs, riddles and songs collected by the missionaries Edmund Dahl and Peter Terp.  The religion.  Despite the fact that the entire life of the Wanjamwesi, all of their actions and customs are strongly influenced and dominated by religious ideas and customs, it is very difficult, if not downright impossible, to bring the religious phenomena into a system, because they are too diverse and, in contrast to the more or less rigid forms of a book religion, there is something far too fluid and unlimited about them. The diversity of religious expressions may be largely due to the fact that the Wanjamwesi are not a uniform tribe, but, as already mentioned at the beginning, are made up of a number of larger and smaller tribes, which have nevertheless retained a certain uniqueness with regard to their religion. What all religious customs and rituals have in common is that, apart from minor traces and rudiments, the ethical element is absent or hardly appears at all, and that religion in all its various manifestations merely arises from and serves daily, practical needs, be it the desire for protection from the manifold evil forces that threaten hardship and death everywhere, or the desire to ensure the success of one's plans. The belief in the soul, the belief that a person's soul can take possession of an object during his lifetime or after his death, also forms a common basis. Furthermore, the entire religious life can be traced back to a certain worship of God, a cult of devils and demons, ancestor worship and belief in magic with all its consequences. The fifth form of religion is the religion of possession, which is mainly practised by the semi-nomadic pastoralist tribes from Uha and Urundi, the so-called Watussi, who live in the north of Unjamwesi, and about which I have already reported in detail in my essay "Uber Geheimbünde bei den Wanjamwesi" (issue 1/2 of this magazine).  The Wanjamwesi have several names for a supreme, supernatural being, which suggest certain, albeit very blurred, concepts of God. What they all have in common, however, is that they have no personal prefix, i.e. they are more or less impersonal, pantheistic. They either name only individual characteristics or are identified with natural forces. However, as these deities are not regarded as evil, they do not play a special role in practical life; and there is virtually no personal relationship with them. First of all, there is "Likuve" = "the everywhere


Page 226

Being", a term that is sometimes also used for the sun. Life, health and all good things come from him. And if the Negro is preparing for a long journey, he is comforted by saying: Likuve is everywhere! Heaven and earth were once formed by "Matunda" - the creative, active one (from kutunda, to create). Parents owe their children's blessing to him. The story goes: Matunda was once very powerful and no one could defeat him. But one day, as he slept, death quietly approached him; and when he woke up, he found himself overcome by insidious death. This name is usually used in conjunction with Shida or Lishida, i.e. Shida Matunda. Another name of God is "Linyangalula'' = the turning around (from kugalula = to turn around), perhaps a kind of fate. The name only occurs in old sayings and greetings. Lyangombe" has a more practical meaning. If the Munjamwesi suddenly finds himself in danger, he quickly prays to Lyangombe, promising to sacrifice a chicken, a goat or a cow to him, depending on his circumstances. Linyangasa is also known as a god's name. However, I do not know the literal meaning of this expression. The name Liwelelo is very common; it means the spread out and is also used exclusively for earth. Linzi, Lyuva and Likuve are different names for the sun, but they also occasionally have the character of names of God. They probably originate from the various dialects that make up Kinjamwesi.  By far the most commonly used name for God is Mulungu. It was therefore introduced into the written language by the Christian missions working among the Wanjamwesi. Mulungu corresponds to Muungu or Mungu in Kiswahili. It cannot be ruled out that the word originates from the coast and only became widespread in Unjamwesi relatively recently.  I am not aware of any sacrifices being made to God or prayers being said to him. However, it is still possible that certain worship of God takes place on the heights of the mountains, or rather used to take place. I deduce this from the fact that the Wanjamwesi explain the Europeans' preference for climbing the mountains by saying that the whites sacrificed to their god on the mountains.  I encountered the devil cult mainly in the southern part of Unjamwesi, in Ukimbu and Ukonongo. However, I was assured that it is known as far as Tanganyika, i.e. far beyond the border. According to some sources, the devil (Katavi) lives in the drainless swamp and lake area of the Rukwasenke, according to others he has his seat in Lake Tanganyika. His power is greatly feared and the constant fear of him also explains the strong veneration, which is expressed in constant propitiatory sacrifices. Katavi is particularly keen on the crops. This is why many fields are surrounded by the "Mugunda gwa Katavi" (the devil's garden). This is a sparsely fenced area several square meters in size, located at one end of the field near the path. In front of it stands a ghost house, a roughly ®/, m high replica of a pointed cone hut, with a miniature bench, crudely assembled from three pieces of wood. Before the sowing begins, the village chief gathers his people here for the sacrificial feast. After the sacrifice, the devil's field is chopped up together and sown with samples of all the crops. Only when this has been done can the general field work begin. A similar ritual celebration in the Devil's Garden precedes the start of the harvest. The huts and benches in front of the. cult gardens are to be dedicated to Katavi


Page 227

invite him to sit and rest on his nightly walks through the fields. If he finds his garden tidy, his ghost house and bench in order, then he passes by. But where it is neglected, it takes revenge with weeds, overgrowth and the like. The area around Lake Rukwa, where Katavi is said to live, is particularly feared. The wanderer or hunter who passes through this area has many rules to observe if he does not want to be lured into the vast Rukwa swamps. Above all, he must avoid loud talking and laughing. It is significant that the belief in the devil is occasionally abused by individuals. It can happen that a man suddenly appears and pretends to have received orders from Katavi. These orders usually consist of him ordering someone to brew beer and organize a cult festival, at which the person commissioned is of course present.  Related to the devil cult is the "Migavo", which are evil spirits or demons that reside in the mentally ill, for example. However, they are only worshipped by a closed society, the "Wamigavo", who form a kind of secret society, similar to the "Waswezi", which I described in more detail in my above-mentioned article "About secret societies among the Wa- njamwesi". In some areas, the Wamigavo appear quite imperious and domineering, demanding cattle, beer etc. from the chiefs and wealthy inhabitants in the name of the spirits. Here, too, one has the strong impression that the "initiates" take advantage of the good faith of the others.  The greatest role in the religious life of the Wanjamwesi is undoubtedly played by ancestor worship, the veneration of the "mizimu". Muzimu (= singular of mizimu) is the name for the soul of the departed!) These mizimu are generally thought of as benign. They are the good household spirits who take part in all the joyful and sad events in the life of the Negro. Nevertheless, if they are neglected by the living, they can also take revenge by sending illness and misery. In this respect, their veneration does not primarily arise from feelings of piety, but is fundamentally based on a certain compulsion, like all religious activities of the Negroes. In the foreground of remembrance and veneration are always the spirits of those who died last, such as father and mother and at most the grandparents. Anything further back falls into oblivion. Each family usually has four mizimu, of which husband and wife each worship two. The forms in which ancestor worship takes place are very simple. In a dark corner of the hut there is a bench-like elevation made of clay. This is the house altar. Here stand the "Finga'", long-necked, often beautifully grown calabash vessels in which the spirits of those to be worshipped are thought to be present. Men and women make their daily and occasional sacrifices and vows before this domestic altar and perform their prayers. The man does not undertake anything without having sacrificed here and invoked the blessing of the mizimu. During sacrifice, a handful of corn or millet flour is stirred into a gourd full of water. The man first takes a mouthful of this flour water and spits it on his finga, while he is holding his 1) The soul of the living person is called 'myuje'. It is the same term that is generally used for breath. For example, "being out of breath" means "myuje japelage" (= the soul has escaped). Unfortunately, I have no information about the relationship between the soul of the living and the body and spirit of the dead. I only know for certain that myuje is never used for the spirit of the deceased; rather, it is always called muzimu. It is a very common expression to say of a sleeping person: "wafwa kumutwe", for example: his head has died. 


Page 228

makes requests and vows. The woman then does the same with her finga. Finally, they both smear the remaining flour paste on their foreheads, temples, armpits and chests. In foreign countries, people go to a crossroads in front of the village or camp at sunset, sprinkle some flour in a criss-cross pattern and ask the spirits for protection and assistance. The prayer to the ancestral spirits is particularly solemn at the beginning of the sowing season. The father of the house then carries all the field tools to the hut and sprinkles them with flour water (lwanga), praying: 'My father, my mother, give us strength for our strenuous field work; give us plenty of rain and a good harvest!" Almost every hut has a small, pointed cone-shaped spirit hut about half a meter high with a small doorway, called a "figavilo". They are also used for ancestor worship. They are erected in times of illness or other distress, on the orders of the medicine man, when he comes to the conclusion, by asking the oracle, that one of the ancestors is angry with the sick or afflicted person. Gourd shells are also placed in the spirit huts and from now on they are sacrificed to in the manner described above. In particularly serious cases, the medicine man advises the consecration of a goat to propitiate the mizimu. The client then chooses a young goat, ties a string of white glass beads around its neck and, if it has been consecrated to the spirit of the father, calls it "father". The consecrated goat is always given the name of the deceased and is generally referred to as mbuli ja mzimu, spirit goat. Such a consecration is only ever carried out on the advice of the medicine man when an illness occurs which, according to the medicine man's oracle, is attributed to the effect of the spirit of a deceased person. It therefore arises from the need to propitiate the spirit in question and to obtain its favor through the good care and treatment of the consecrated animal. The consecrated goat can be recognized by a string of white beads that is looped around its neck or horns. It is off-limits to everyone and enjoys the greatest freedom. If the animal dies, another takes its place. In cases of poverty, a white rooster can also be donated in place of the billy goat. The beer vows are also very popular, which consist of promising the mizimu to brew a few pots of beer on some occasion. The Wanjamwesi's great fondness for coffee beer probably plays an important role here. Once the beer is ready - the preparation takes 5 days - the family clan gathers together. The first sip is spit out with prayers in honor of the spirits, after which they stay together through the night until the pots have been emptied. A large part of the frequent nightly beer binges are in fact ritual celebrations.  Among the chiefs, ancestor worship takes on larger and more solemn forms. The spirit huts, for example, are considerably larger, often as big as small huts, and one of these huts is usually inhabited by a maiden who is consecrated in a special way to the service of the ancestors.  But according to Wanjamwesi belief, not only humans have their mizimu, animals are also said to be accompanied and protected by their spirits. If the hunter does not succeed in catching prey, for example, it is always said that the game has been warned and protected by its mizimu.  The fourth of the main forms of religion I mentioned was the belief in magic. It not only permeates the entire religious life of the Wanjamwesi in all its forms, but also dominates all their actions and thoughts and thus has practically the strongest influence on their lives.


Page 229

Power over their souls. At every turn, they feel surrounded and threatened by invisible magical powers, and their constant concern is to protect themselves from the effects of these sinister forces. The whole complex of sorcery, magical means and effects is summarized under the name 'Vulogi' (from kuloga = to conjure, witch). The bearers and owners of these secret powers are the "Walogi" = sorcerers. As a rule, it is older men and women who are addressed as sorcerers. However, most of them are not known. It is said that the sorcerers keep tamed hyenas in their huts, on which they ride out at midnight on the full moon and gather under large, sacred trees to dance. The great eared owl is also regarded as the wizards' companion. It is therefore always chased away with scolding and curses when it settles on the top of the hut roof at night. Not everyone who is regarded as a sorcerer is one. For some, however, the mere suspicion is the reason to isolate themselves and allow themselves to be introduced to the black art by professional sorcerers; for being suspected of sorcery is usually synonymous with being an outcast from family and society, being ostracized.  As long as misery and misfortune are not seen as the revenge of neglected spirits (mizimu), they are attributed to the work of sorcerers. When a sick person comes to the medicine man, he first tries to find out where the magic effect came from with the help of his oracle instrument. The oracle instrument is usually the "Kasanda'', an instrument consisting of a number of small pieces of wood fastened crosswise on top of each other and joined together, which can be pulled apart and pushed together like a pair of star scissors. The medicine man grasps one end and lets the other swing freely. In the resting position, the free end is supposed to indicate the direction in which the magician lives. Others use a wooden vessel that is half filled with water during the oracle, on which a small wooden block floats. In some places, the magician's seat is also to be determined from the entrails of the chicken. Death is regarded as a magical effect under all circumstances, including violent death by shooting or similar. In this case, the weapon or bullet was enchanted.  The practice of sorcery takes on a practical and almost fatal significance in that 'vulogi' is not only understood to mean wishing spells and the like, but is also synonymous with poisoning and murder by poison. In my experience, there is no doubt that wizards are indeed poisoners and know various fast and slow killing poisons. I have witnessed several deaths and heard of others which, in my opinion, could only have been caused by poison. The victims in question all died within a few hours from colic-like pains without having been ill beforehand. In such cases, the poison is bought by the sorcerers for expensive money or goods and mixed into the beer. The fact that poison murder is occasionally practiced under the name "vulogi" was unfortunately not known to Europeans, if at all. This is the only explanation for the fact that complaints of sorcery (vulogi), in reality murder by poison, were not listened to much by the native judges, because sorcery was regarded as nothing more than a figment of the imagination and hocus-pocus.  If the belief in magic rests on such a real foundation, it is easy to imagine the downright devastating effects it must have on social life. Above all, there is the mistrust that inhibits and undermines all social life. I


Page 230

I have been told that Wanjamwesi who have been away from home for years often only return home with a certain inner fear and refuse to eat and drink with their own relatives for the first few days for fear of enchantment, i.e. poisoning. Whole large settlements are often abandoned within a few days, perhaps because several deaths have occurred in succession which were believed to be due to the activity of a sorcerer. For fear of the evil eye and the resentment of her neighbors, the mother suddenly takes off with her newborn child and lives for months in quiet seclusion with some relative. People try to protect themselves from the effects of sorcery by wearing various amulets. The fangs of wild cats and the small horns of dwarf antelopes, which are worn on a string around the neck, are particularly popular; a flat, triangular shell also plays a major role as a means of protection. But the fear and insecurity still remains and casts a deep shadow over the otherwise carefree life of the Wanjamwesi.  It is also widely believed that some sorcerers have the power to transform themselves into lions or leopards at night in order to break into huts and cattle kraals and kill people and livestock. If, for example, a pride of lions haunts an area, people are convinced that these are not forest and steppe lions, but sorcerers who appear in lion form, so-called masumbano (= images). Such people are said to be recognizable above all by the fact that they have a stiff neck and as a result cannot turn their heads freely. In the past, such alleged lion and leopard sorcerers were killed or brought to the chief of the country, who often kept them in chains for years.  There is no actual priesthood among the Wanjamwesi. As described above, the house father performs the usual daily ritual acts. Cult celebrations that concern the whole village, e.g. at the start of sowing and harvesting, the consecration of the devil's garden, etc., are led by the village chief. The medicine man (Kinjamwesi = mufumu) is only called in for ceremonial occasions. In a certain sense, the medicine men are regarded as the bearers of religious tradition and the village chief can to a certain extent be regarded as the highest priest. But even he only occasionally performs the duties of a priest. As I said, there is no fixed hierarchical order anywhere. Everything gives the impression of being more random.  I have already described the way in which the sacrifices are performed in the section on ancestor worship above. As a rule, flour porridge, beer and the first crops are sacrificed. Bloody sacrifices are only made on special occasions. By chance, I was privileged to attend one such rare sacrificial celebration, which took place on the occasion of the installation of a new village chief. This sacrificial feast was of particular significance as the new chief's predecessor had been executed for murder by the German government a few weeks earlier. His son, a boy of about 10, was now to be appointed heir to the rights and duties of a village chief. When I happened to enter the village in the early morning, I found a silent gathering of about 50 to 60 natives sitting in a circle around the medicine man. He had already erected some spirit huts and was in the process of preparing the sacrificial area. An area of about 1 square meter was covered with green branches and leaves from the mukalakala tree at a height of about


Page 231

10cm. The sacrificial priest then mixed flour porridge (lwanga) in a kalebas bowl, sprinkled the sacrificial site and the spirit huts with a tuft of green leaves while invoking the ancestral spirits and finally smeared the new village chief and his closest relatives on the forehead, shoulders and chest with the flour porridge. The sacrificial animal, a young black goat, was then brought and also coated with Iwanga, first by the priest, then by the heir and finally by the three wives of the executed man. This was followed by a lengthy prayer by the priest. He placed the sacrificial animal upright in front of him, dipped its front feet into the flour paste, sprinkled it over the sacrificial site again and touched the boy's body in various places. During the prayer, the medicine man alternately pointed the upright goat towards the four celestial regions and summoned the spirits. I couldn't understand most of his words, as the prayer seemed to be in old, unfamiliar language forms. From time to time he would call out: "Mtimbo!" to which those sitting around would regularly respond with "hm!". Then again you would hear the question: "Kuhola nanali?" (= when is peace?). To which the congregation responded: "lelo!" (= today). Finally, he asked the spirits to protect the boy and not to lead him the way of his father. - The actual sacrifice was introduced by a short, silent meditation by the medicine man, after which he laid the sacrificial goat on its side and stabbed it in the head through the ear with a small, pointed knife of the kind not normally used, whereupon the auricle filled with blood. The priest used the blood to smear the boy in various places, the household utensils and weapons consecrated to the spirits, the doorposts of the spirit huts and finally all the family members. All this was done to the constant murmuring of the medicine man. Only after he had finished did he kill the goat by cutting its neck, which ended the first part of the ceremony. Unfortunately, I could not wait for the rest of the sacrificial feast. However, I was told by an older Mu- njamwesi that the medicine man examines the entrails of the sacrificial animal after the sacrifice. If it turns out that one of the spirits has been forgotten, beer must be sacrificed to it. In the afternoon, the communal sacrificial meal takes place after the priest has prayed and thrown a piece of meat to each of the four cardinal points. He himself receives the back and a leg of the sacrificed animal for his efforts. Finally, a small, ring-shaped piece of fur is cut out of the goat's scalp and slipped over the hand of the sacrificer, who then wears it as an amulet on his arm.  To conclude my remarks on the religion of the Wanjamwesi, I will leave you with three short mythological tales, as they were collected on the spot by missionary superintendent H. Löbner at the time.  1. how death came into the world.  Shida Matunda had created everything: Heaven and earth, herbs and trees and animals. Finally, he also created two women and married them. One of them was his favorite wife. When she died, he buried her in her house and never left her day or night. The other woman brought him food and drink every day. But she put the food outside the door, because she was not allowed in the house. Shida Matunda watered the grave of his favorite wife every day. One day, however, a small plant grew from the grave and grew taller and taller. 


Page 232

Shida Matunda rejoiced, for now he knew that the dead would rise. .  One day, however, when his supply of wood had run out, he went into the forest to look for new firewood. His other wife saw this. In her great curiosity she came over and said to herself: now I want to go in and see what is keeping him in this house. So she went in. But when she saw the plant on the grave, she became very jealous, took a hoe and cut the plant down. The blood of the deceased gushed out and filled the house. But the woman quickly left the house. - Soon after, Shida Matunda came back, put the firewood in front of the house door and went inside. When he saw the blood, he was very frightened. He called his wife and said, "Why have you done this? You have killed your wife and thereby caused all people, animals and plants to die. Everything that was created by me must now die because you acted badly against my wife.  Since then, everything must die: Men, animals and all living things; for from this woman, who killed her co-wife, came all generations.  2 The building of the Valengo tower.  In the beginning lived the Valengo. They were a large family, lived in a huge city and had one language. One day they said to each other: Let's build a high tower and go up to the sky to get water! All the Valengo agreed and immediately began to build. They built for many months until they were close to the sky. One day they said, "Let's go back and call all the people in the city together. They went back to the city and proclaimed to their children and their children's children: Tomorrow we will enter heaven, for the tower reaches to the sky. Everyone agreed. The next morning they climbed the tower. But as they were close to the sky, they saw a very great wind coming. The tower broke in two in the middle and all the Valengo died without leaving any descendants. Therefore, when a family dies out, they say: "vamala kilengo'" = they died like the Valengo.  3. how it came about that people have to work so hard.  In ancient times there lived a man and a woman who had a son. The woman ground only one grain a day, cooked it and they had enough to eat. One day, the son married a woman. When she came into the house, the mother-in-law said to her: "My child, grind only one grain a day so that we can eat and be full." But once, when the mother-in-law had gone out and the young woman was alone, she said: "What do you mean, only grind one grain at a time! I'm going to grind lots of grains today!" She ground and ground, but there was no more. She took more and more grains - for nothing. Then her mother-in-law came and said, "What are you doing, my child? Why have you done this to us? We've only ever ground one grain and we've had enough. You have been disobedient and have sinned. Now we will no longer have the strength to till the fields. You have sinned greatly and that is why we will have much trouble and hardship from now on."  The fairy tale. The fairy tale plays a very important role in the spiritual possession of the Wanjamwesi. On the one hand, it is made to explain the relatively

The night is a time to fill long evenings around the hearth or campfire, and it also satisfies the strong need, after the day's work and heat, to indulge in a freer world freed from the constraints of everyday life and to forget the constant, paralyzing fear of the evil powers for a few hours. It is precisely at night that the Negro becomes particularly aware of the sinister and destructive nature of the magical powers. It is therefore no coincidence that people prefer to gather around the storyteller in the evening and listen to his tales with rapt attention. It is often not so much the material itself that is important as the way in which the fairy tale is told and sometimes mimed. A certain degree of storytelling and presentation skill is required of the narrator. The listener wants to see the animals and characters acting or speaking as characteristically as possible in order to take an inner part in their fate and misfortune, in a word, he wants to experience the fairy tale. That is why the storytellers are mostly older, mature people who have traveled a lot, experienced a lot and have a relatively large amount of knowledge of human nature and experience. Rarely have I seen more excited listeners and spectators than when a good storyteller tells his tales around a campfire.  In terms of subject matter, there is no clear distinction between the fairy tale as such and the animal fable. In fact, the two forms of storytelling often merge into one another. Another peculiarity of the Njamwesi fairy tale is that it prefers to take on a slightly didactic character by caricaturing human weaknesses in the form of a narrative detached from the temporal and the accidental, or by presenting theories based on experience. This includes, for example, the story of the glutton who never gets enough until he finally dies of hunger and misery.  In most fairy tales, animals act and speak either exclusively or in part. And here again, it is the rabbit in particular that plays a very unique role. It is the fairy-tale or mythical animal of the Wanjamwesi. Even in everyday life, it is believed to have all kinds of characteristics and is regarded as a paragon of cunning and cunning. For example, it is said to be able to make itself invisible when pursued; or it is claimed that it likes to sneak into herds of cattle and drink the cows' udders dry. In fairy tales, however, there are no limits to his cleverness and sophistry. Here he is trusted with absolutely everything. So he actually represents our Reinecke the Fox. Admittedly, he is not quite as cunning and deceitful as the latter; on the contrary, he occasionally even likes to put his cunning at the service of those who have innocently fallen into need and distress. When the story has reached its climax and nothing seems to be able to save the victim threatened by crude violence, the hare suddenly appears as a deus ex machina and, thanks to his cleverness and presence of mind, always finds a way out. A typical example of this is the fairy tale of the huntsman and his wife, who are saved by the hare's intervention.  After these brief, general remarks, I will follow with some fairy tales as I recorded them in Unjamwesi at the time according to stories. I had the two tales reproduced in the original text written down by the sub-teacher Abel in Usoke near Tabora. The translation of these is as literal as possible. I owe the last sample ''Wie der Hase sich einmal Fleisch verschaffte" to a record by missionary P. Terp.  Journal of Ethnology. Vol. 1927/28. issue 3/6. 16

1 The famine and the lion. (Recorded in Kitunda, Kiwere.) Once upon a time there was a great famine. At that time there lived a man with his wife and children. They were in great need because they had nothing left to eat and no possessions to trade for food.  So one morning the man went into the forest to look for firewood. On the way, he met the lion. After they had greeted each other, the man complained that they had nothing left to eat and no possessions to buy. The lion replied: 'Because you are my blood friend, I will help you. Tomorrow morning at sunrise, go to the termite mound in the garden behind your house and you will find a piece of fresh meat there. I only ask one thing of you: tell me whether your friendship is true, without falsehood or ulterior motives. The man replied: "How can you ask like that? You are my very best friend, you are our savior and father." "Good," said the lion, "we'll see."  Early the next morning, they all went out into the garden. And when they came to the termite mound, there was a large piece of meat, and their joy was great and all hardship came to an end. Every morning their first trip was to the termite mound and they always found a piece of meat there. And so it was for a long time.  Then one day the lion said to himself: I will see if my friend has spoken the truth, I will put him to the test. When night fell, he went into the forest and killed an antelope. Then he took some of its blood and spread it all over himself. And so, not far from the path, he lay down beside the antelope as if he had died.  The next morning, the man went with his wife and children to the termite mound as usual to fetch the meat. But the place was empty. Then the wife became very sad, for she thought that some misfortune had happened to our friend, and the children began to cry. While they were weeping and wailing, a man came running and shouted, "The lion is dead! He's lying covered in blood next to an antelope he hit."  The man ran into the house, fetched an axe and his large knife and set off for the forest. The wife and children followed, weeping. They saw the lion from afar and the antelope lying next to him. The lion, however, remained very still, only his eyes blinking into the distance. There he saw the man coming along with quick steps, a long, flashing knife in his hand and his axe on his shoulder. He also saw the woman and the children and heard their wailing and howling.  In the meantime, the man had arrived. He quickly sharpened the knife on a large stone and approached the lion to pull off its skin. Just as he was about to put the knife down, the lion jumped up and stood in front of the terrified man. "So!" he shouted angrily, "is this your friendship? Is this your love without falsity and ulterior motives?" But the man couldn't say a word in reply !) When the lion is referred to as a blood friend in fairy tales, this is only intended to express a particularly high or rather the highest degree of friendship. The same term can occasionally be applied to other animals appearing in fairy tales. In general, the expression "blood friend" = munwani is often heard in the daily conversation of the Negroes, where it simply means friend, for example: Good friend or old friend.

Horror and fear. "I will punish you for this," he continued. "You shall die on the spot. Your wife and children shall never be harmed, for they have wept and mourned me like a good friend."  And so it happened. The man was killed. But the woman and the children continued to be provided with meat by the lion until the famine was over.  2. how the hare set the king's totem free.  Once upon a time there was a king and queen who had an only daughter. She was very beautiful and her parents loved her dearly. When she had grown up and suitors came from all sides, the king devised a ruse, for he did not want to give up his dear child.  Far out in his field at the edge of the forest was a huge termite mound, covered with large trees and dense bushes. In the mound, however, hidden in the bushes, was a large cave, and a family of lions had lived there since time immemorial. When a suitor came, the king said: "I am willing to give you my daughter as a wife if you first clear my termite mound in the forest of trees and bushes." Full of joy, the young man took the axe, went to the mound and began to chop down the trees. But no sooner had he begun than the lions burst out of their den and devoured him. That was the fate of many a brave young man. A great fear spread throughout the land and no one dared to ask for the hand of the king's daughter.  After a long time, a king's son} came from afar with his warriors and made his request to the king. But he said, 'First go and clean up my termite mound, then you shall have my daughter as your wife. The prince armed his men with axes and bush knives. But no sooner had they begun to clear the mound than the lions burst out and tore the prince and all his warriors apart so that not a single one returned.  The king now thought he was finally at peace from the savages. Then one day the hare appeared at the royal court and demanded to be brought before the king. When asked in astonishment what he wanted, the hare replied: "I love your daughter and ask for her hand in marriage." The king was speechless. But then he replied: "Have you not heard how many have already wooed my child in vain? And don't you know the test my future son-in-law has to pass?' The hare, however, remained unperturbed. He replied calmly: 'I know everything; I also know the test. If you promise to give me your daughter as a wife, I will clear the enchanted termite hill of trees and bushes today." "Good," said the king, "I promise you; go and try your skill."  So the hare took an old stool, polished smooth from sitting on it so often, and two marbles and went to the dreaded mound. Once there, he sat down and, singing a little song to himself, began to play with his marbles on the stool, spinning them like tops. When the lions heard the song, they came out of their hiding place, but stopped in amazement and watched the hare's play with curiosity. Soon they liked it so much that the chief of the lion family asked the hare to allow them to lie around the stool. The game was so beautiful 16*


Page 236

and they like the song so much; they want to learn it too. The clever rabbit had been waiting for this. He gladly agreed. And soon all five lions were sitting around the stool, the chief on his right, listening to the song and watching the dancing and whirling marbles with wide eyes. And every time one of the marbles hit the other and threw it in a great arc over the edge of the stool, a great cry of joy went up among the spectators. But the hare kept on playing, singing his little song and seemingly paying little attention to the lions.  Suddenly, however, he stopped, made a very sad face and stopped singing. "What's the matter with you, my friend?" the old man asked him; "why don't you play any more? Are you afraid of us? Don't be afraid, no one must harm you." "I can't go on," said the hare in a tearful voice, "the lion here on my left has an evil eye, he has bewitched me, and there is only one thing to do if you want me to go on playing: take a strong bast rope, bind the magician's hands and feet, and lay him there on his side." It was done. In an instant, the lion with the evil eye was tied up and put on his side.  The game began again. The hare sang and the marbles danced and whirled around, sometimes around each other, sometimes against each other. And when one hit the other and threw it over the edge of the chair in a wide arc, the lions whooped with joy. But the rabbit pretended not to hear it. He continued to play and sing quietly. Suddenly, however, his singing stopped, the marbles rested and the hare sat there, trembling, as if struck by lightning and making a sad face. "What's the matter, my little friend?" asked the old man to his right anxiously. But he just pointed silently at the lion sitting opposite him, and the old man understood. He immediately had him tied up and laid on his side.  In the meantime, the hare had rested and could begin again. But he succeeded twice more in his cunning disguise. As soon as he had been playing for a while, he suddenly claimed to be bewitched. Then he only had to point to one of the lions and he was visibly bound.  Finally, four lions lay tied up on the ground. Only the old man was left. The hare sang his most beautiful songs. He twirled the marbles so that it was a joy and the old man could hardly contain himself with pleasure, even though his throat was tired from all the singing and his hands ached from the constant twirling of the marbles. But at last he could take no more. He looked wistfully at the old lion and said, 'Dear friend, don't be angry with me, I can't go on. This moved the old man, and he too fell into the trap. He only had one request: to be allowed to stay near the stool so that he could watch the game, because it was too beautiful. So the hare looked for a particularly strong rope and bound his hands and feet with all his strength. He then ran quickly to the next village, got himself a sharp axe and killed the defenceless lions one by one.  Now the hare had won the game. Soon the hill was cleared of trees and bushes. And before the sun had even set, he stood before the astonished king and reported with a confident victory: "Lord, I have passed the test, your condition has been fulfilled: there is not a single bush left on the enchanted termite hill." The king was finally defeated. And that very evening, the hare celebrated his wedding to the king's beautiful daughter.

3. how the hare once outwitted all the animals. (Recorded in Ussoke near Tabora.) The animals of the forest were once in great need. They had no more water, for there was drought and aridity in the land, and all the wells and waterholes and rivers had dried up.  So the elephant summoned the representatives of the forest dwellers to a council meeting. The aim was to find a way out of this dire situation. After much toing and froing, the hyena stood up and shouted: "Listen to me! A good idea has occurred to me. The king orders all his subjects to come together with their picks and shovels. Then let's dig a big water hole together and not stop until we have found enough water." Everyone was delighted with the hyena's good advice and praised her great intellect. But the king said: "Because you have spoken so wisely and intelligently, you should go through the forest with the big drum and call out my command." So the hyena took the king's drum, walked through the forest, played the drum and called out: 'Come to the king tomorrow morning with your picks and shovels and let's dig a well together so that we can get water again and not die." Full of joy, all the animals agreed and promised to come.  The next morning, as the sun rose, the forest dwellers gathered in front of the king's house. They all came; only one was missing, the hare. The king sent out to call him. When he arrived, the elephant asked him: "My friend, aren't you thirsty? Don't you want to help dig?" But he replied cheekily: "I don't need your water and I won't help you dig the well either". "Very well," said the king, "if you are too noble or too lazy to work, you should never drink from our water." Then they set to work. But the hare went home.  The animals dug a huge hole, wide and deep, until they found water. And when evening came, the hole was already full. They were very happy about this. They all drank their fill and danced with pleasure until the sun went down. Then they picked up their heels and wanted to go home. But the elephant said, 'Stay here for a moment, my friends, I still have a word to say. You know that the hare refused to help us this morning. He is a sly fellow. I'm sure he's just waiting until we've all gone so that he can come here and drink his fill. That's why we have to leave someone behind to guard the water. "But who should take over the guarding duties?" a voice was now raised; "we all know the hare, his cunning and slyness."" Then they agreed to entrust the guard to the most agile and quick-footed. A race was organized, in which the gazelle far outdid all the others. It was therefore unanimously appointed as the well keeper. The animals dispersed and went home. Only the gazelle stayed behind at the waterhole.  It was not long before the hare came sauntering along. He carried a large calabash on his shoulder. He had just reached the edge of the well when the gazelle jumped up and snapped at him: "What are you doing here, are you going to draw water that you haven't dug?" Smiling calmly, the hare replied: "Don't get upset, my friend, I don't need your water; I have something much better here." And with that, he took a big swig from his calabash. The gazelle became curious and wanted to know what was in it. The hare handed her the jar. But when she saw beautiful, fresh millet beer inside, her peace of mind was shattered. She immediately put the calabash jug on the


Page 238

mouth and drank to the full. And she drank again and again until she finally fell over and sank into a deep sleep. The hare had been waiting for this. Laughing, he climbed into the well, drank his fill and filled his vessel. Then he tied the gazelle with a bark rope and went away.  When the animals came to draw water the next morning, they saw what the hare had done. They asked the gazelle how it had happened. She told them that the hare had come during the night and must have bewitched her, causing her to fall asleep. She knew nothing else.  Now they asked the lion to take over as guardian. He was so strong, all he had to do was growl, they said, and the hare would forget about his arrogance. The lion agreed, and when it began to get dark, he lay down not far from the well. As soon as the animals had retired, the hare came strolling along. Today he carried only a small spear. But his hair was beautifully combed and braided into lots of cute little plaits. The lion looked at him in amazement and his eyes rested with pleasure on the beautiful, dainty braids. The hare, however, pretended not to see him and made a show of walking past. "Where are you going?" called the lion. "I'm going for a walk," he replied. "Tell me, my friend," asked the wellkeeper, "who combed and plaited your hair so beautifully?" The hare replied, 'No one, I always do it myself. The lion praised the hare's skill with many words and finally asked: "Would you also make my hair so beautiful?" "Oh yes, I will do that," replied the hare, "but you must promise me that you will be very quiet about it. It would be best if you let yourself be bound, for it is a tedious job and I'm afraid you might get tired and accidentally hurt me with your big hands. The lion in his vanity readily agreed to everything and patiently allowed his hands and feet to be bound. But as he lay there completely defenceless, the hare laughed at him instead of combing him. He then jumped into the nearby bushes and returned with his calabash. Fainting, the lion had to watch as the hare climbed into the well and drew water. And after the hare had taken another bath and wished the well keeper a good night, he disappeared with his jug.  The animals were astonished when they saw the tied-up lion the next morning. Now they were firmly convinced that the hare must be a powerful magician. Even the lion asserted this as loudly as he could. - As a result, no one dared to take on the role of guardian. They were about to leave the well to its own devices when the frog stepped forward and said: 'Now I will try, the rabbit shall not slip away from me'." They all laughed at him. But he asked them to try it with him, and finally the king agreed.  And so, just as the sun was setting, the frog began his watch over the well. He jumped into the water, dived in up to the tip of his nose and waited for the hare. When it arrived, he was surprised to find the waterhole unguarded. He circled it a few times, peering in all directions, and when he had made sure that the coast was clear, he descended unsuspectingly into the well. But no sooner had he taken a few strokes than the frog bit him on the nose, held him fast and the hare was caught. The next morning, the animals were delighted to see what the frog had done. The hare was immediately seized and tied up. They informed


Page 239

The king and all the inhabitants of the forest flocked together to see the prisoner and attend the court session. - It did not last long. It was unanimously decided to kill the hare because he had polluted the precious water, mocked the animals and bewitched the faithful well keepers with his black art. The sinner was to be smashed to pieces on a large stone near the well.  When the hare realized that he was in for it, he begged to speak and said: "Dear brothers, I realize that I deserve to die because of my wicked deeds. But I beg you to grant me one last request. Do not throw me against this stone here, as you have decided, for that would only half kill me, but hurl me against this termite mound. That's the only way I'll die quickly and safely." The animals were persuaded. They dragged him to the termite mound, untied him and threw him to the ground with all their might. But the hare picked himself up like the wind and instantly disappeared into a termite tube.  So the hare outwitted all the animals in the forest with his great cunning. And no one dared to try to kill him again.  4 How the hare saved the hunter's wife. (Recorded in Kitunda, Kiwere.) There was once a man who married a young, beautiful woman. But as he loved her very much and was always afraid that she might be taken away from him, he took her far away into the forest where no people lived. Here they cut down trees and built themselves a hut. When they had nothing left to eat, the man twisted ropes and set snares to catch game. Every morning when the sun rose, he got up and went into the forest to check his snares. And each time he brought home a piece of game.  One morning, however, when the man went out again to check his snares, the lion met him. After they had greeted each other, the lion said: "My friend, I have grown old and weak and can no longer hunt as I once did. I am hungry. Help me, you are my blood friend." "I will gladly do so," replied the hunter, "I catch game every day and can give you a good share of my prey." "I don't need much," said the lion, "if you just give me the guts of every piece that goes into the trap, I'll be happy. It's best if we meet every morning on the crossroads, walk the traps together and divide the prey: you take the meat and I get the guts." The man thought to himself: "What a pity! My wife likes nothing better than the guts. But what should I do? My friend could become uncomfortable if I cut him off." So he agreed. But he did not tell his wife about the arrangement.  The next morning, as usual, he came home laden with booty. His wife approached him from afar and wanted to take the load off him. Then she saw that the animal had been gutted. She was surprised and asked, "Where have you got the entrails?" "They're there by the place where I caught it," the man lied, "the load would have been too heavy for me. - The next day he brought back a small dwarf antelope. When his wife asked him again where the entrails were, he said: "The hyena had already eaten them." Now she realized that something was wrong. And when the man returned day after day without the much-desired treat, she decided to get to the bottom of it. 


Page 240

One morning, when the hunter had left, she sneaked after him. But she had no idea where the pitfalls lay. Suddenly, before she knew it, she stepped into a small depression in the path and there she was, trapped. Now she began to cry miserably for help, louder and louder, until the man became aware of the unusual cries and rushed over with his friend, the lion.  Startled, the man wanted to free his wife from the snare when the lion called out to him in astonishment: 'Stop, stop! what do you want to do? since when do you release the game before you have killed it? The man replied: "It's not an animal, it's my wife! Can't you see it?" "I don't care," said the lion, "our contract is that I get the entrails of every animal that goes into the trap, and I insist on that.'" The man resorted to pleading, he began to promise, but it was no use, the lion stuck to his guns: 'I demand what is mine.  While they were arguing and the woman was weeping and wailing in the snare, the hare came along the path. Astonished, he stopped and asked: 'What's all this noise, why are you arguing here? Tell me your business, I will try to settle the dispute". Then they both recounted their dispute in many words. The lion persisted: "I demand my rights" and the hunter asked the hare to help him.  The hare listened in silence. Now he began his speech. "First of all," he said, "you must first free the woman, so that I can investigate how it is possible for a man to step into a wild snare, since he has much more sense than the animals of the forest." 'You see,' interjected the lion quickly, turning to his friend, 'that's what I told you! Anyone who falls into a trap has no brains and can only be an animal." But the hare ordered him to be silent.  The woman was freed. Then they bent the quick tree to the ground, carefully laid the snare in the hollow and skillfully covered it with earth, dry grass and leaves. And now the hare asked the lion to show how the woman had stepped into it, to demonstrate it exactly. The lion, in his simplicity, obeyed the hare and walked unsuspectingly towards the place where he had been caught. He was just about to say, "That's how she did it," when, before he knew it, he stepped into the hole and there he was in the trap. He immediately screamed and shouted so that the forest roared, but it didn't help him. Nobody moved to help him. But the hare said to the people, 'Now hurry up and get home.  So the hare had saved the hunter's wife from death.  The tale of the head who married the king's tocter.  Munhu umo wali wavyala itwe Na mutemi uvyala mwana mkima, mulenzi wa vusul) muno.

Then he spoke to the king and said, "I too would like to do this work. Perhaps I will be ready to marry your child." The king was astonished and said, "I doubt it very much, the healthy people do not like it, and a fetish consisting only of a head should be able to do it!" Then the head said: "The king will have all the axes in the city brought together. Take me out to the square." They brought all the axes together. They carried him to the square and when they arrived, they sat him down on his chair. Then he said, "It's all right, go home!" When they had gone, he called out, "Head, come out! Quick, so that we can free the king's daughter." Then many people came out of the head. They took up axes to clear the land. They started in the morning and worked until midday. The trees fell in heaps. Then he said, 'Bring me food! But when they brought it, they found only the head. But the trees were lying around in heaps. They were astonished beyond measure. But he said to them: "Go away!" When they had gone, he called out: "Come out, my young men, eat the food quickly." Then many people went out and ate all the corn mash. After they had eaten, they finished their work.  When the sun turned, they were finished. Then he said, "Tell the king to come and see the work and order his servants to collect their tools and carry me home."

And he said, "O truly, the head has conquered me." And the king had him brought to the residence and gave him the daughter as a bride. And the head married the princess.  When night fell, he said: "Come out, quick, we want to talk to the king's daughters." But one night, when the head's wife woke up, the head was no longer there. Instead, she saw a man with a beautiful face. She was astonished and said: "Is it possible! I thought I had only married a head and lo and behold, it is a real man." But the next morning he was a head again. Then the king's daughter devised a trick. She slaughtered a sheep. For she said that when it was night, he would take off his skin so that he could talk to people (= be human). Then, when the skin is gone, he will become human.  When the sun went down, she went into the house and carefully hid the sheepskin. Then they slept. In the night he said, 'Head, come out quickly so that we can talk to the children of men. But the young woman snored and pretended to be asleep. When she saw that he was a man and was fast asleep, she got up, took the cover and burned it in the fire together with the sheepskin. When the man woke up, he called his shell. But the shell did not come. He was very surprised, for he smelled the scent of the burnt sheepskin. Then his wife said, "Is it possible, my husband, you are a real man? But that you have covered the fetish so badly!"  In the morning, however, this story came before the king. The king said, "Of course, I thought so, it is impossible for a mere head to do such things." The king was very pleased. And

He got up with his axe, went and looked for honey in the forest. When he came into the forest, the honey-indicator took him and led him to a tree full of honey. Oh, honeycombs all white! As he strained to rub fire, he (the honey indicator) came, blew at him and said, "O, the good lies ahead!'' That man went away and followed again. When he came further, he found a horse antelope that had been eaten. Oh, he was very happy. He said, "Aha, here is the good thing I was told about." Then, as he pulled out the knife and was about to break it open to gut it, he came again, blew into his eyes and said, "The good thing is right there!" And as he hesitated, he blew at him again. The man stood up. He left that horse antelope. He went forward again, nke, nke, nke, nke. When he got to the front, he found a dead giraffe. He said: "Oh, truly, this is the good thing that was promised to me". But just as he was about to start, he blew at him: "The good thing is further ahead. He was very surprised. He said: "What good thing, what I will see, will surpass what I left behind?" He came back and blew at him. So he got up again and followed him. As he went forward, ke, nke, ke, nke, he brought him to a cave.

Since then, to take revenge on the bees, the honey indicator lures everyone who walks through the forest to the trees inhabited by bees."  2) To paint the sound that the footsteps make.

But when he tried to go in to take out a load, the bird blew at him again and kept on blowing. Oh, now the man was annoyed, he said, "Hm, I'm not going away from there." But he returned and blew at him again. Then he followed; he thought: just once more, then no more. He took him back to a cave that was full of elephants' teeth and hippos. Oh, all sorts of things were there. Now the sun was tilting. And he said, "I guess this is the good thing I was promised. While he was still undecided, the bird came back and said: "The good thing is up ahead." Oh, now he was finished. He took him: nke nke, hke nike, and brought him to a fig tree. There he was now. All white with honeycomb. But the sun was setting. He tried to rub fire. He did not succeed. It hurt him a lot. He said, this is where I've ended up. You see now, with a hungry stomach I must go to sleep. He took off his skins, spread them out and put his axe under his head.  But when he woke up, he found himself in a huge city without borders. And two beautiful women were there. He was very happy. Everyone went kwa, kwa, kwa, kwa, and shouted kasinde, ka- sinde! Then he was given a prohibition: to drink only Mulambya beer, but no millet beer. But one day his subjects brewed him a lot of beer! Millet beer, honey beer and Mulambya beer. When he saw that his wives were going out, he quickly entered the house. And said: "What's with the ban? I am so thirsty. And I only ever drink Mulambya beer. But now I want to drink millet beer and see if I get punished for it." So he took !) The clapping of hands when greeting the chief.

One day the hare became hungry for meat. So he called all the animals together. After they were all together, he went to the lion and said: "Kill the giraffe for me!" He then persuaded the leopard to kill the antelope, the big snake to kill the elephant and so on. But when the other animals wanted to flee, he ordered them to stay and said to the lion, the leopard and the snake: "You are very brave, kill a lot of animals now!" They then tore a large number of them to pieces, while all the others fled. Finally, he persuaded the snake to kill the lion and the leopard. Now the hare was alone with the snake. Then he said to the snake: 'Now we have plenty of meat. I want to skin the animals; but where will we get the fire to roast them?" "I don't know, my friend," the snake replied. 'So you go and get it,' said the hare. "But first I will make you a fireproof dress so that you don't burn." So he dressed her in an old, dry bark robe, leaving only her head bare. Then the hare said, "Go now and get a fire. If you see a small fire, go past; but if you see a large one, go into the middle of it and return along a beautiful grassy path, then the fire will follow you of its own accord." The snake obeyed and went to look for the fire, but the hare began to scavenge. After a while, he saw a big fire coming. He was very happy and said: "Now the big snake is dying in the steppe fire and the fire will soon be here to roast my meat. Truly, I have a great mind."  Riddles.  A very popular form of entertainment among the Wanjamwesi is giving and solving riddles. These riddles usually take a short form. Whoever has to give up a riddle says: "Kalagwe!" (= about, I have something to guess), to which the person addressed replies: "Kize'' (= may it come). Here is a small selection of typical riddles and joke questions in the original language with a literal translation, as collected by missionary Edmund Dahl in Urambo, in the northern part of Unjamwesi.  1st question: Kaziwa kado maSifi- A well full of pebbles? wemo pa?

The proverbs and sayings of the Wanjamwesi provide an extraordinarily interesting insight into their way of thinking and their view of the world, which they possess in large numbers and like to use at every opportunity. They also bear witness to their keen powers of observation. In some of the proverbs, general phenomena of human life are summed up in a short, concise formula. For example, let me remind you of number 37 of the samples listed below: 'A dog monkey laughs at another's backside because it cannot see its own. Many of the winged words used daily in conversation or in court proceedings are, so to speak, the transcripts of fairy tales such as No. 52 'The good lies ahead', which finds its illumination in the story of the glutton; or No. 48 'A good word even brings a goat down from the tree'."  I owe the following beautiful collection of proverbs to the notes of missionary P. Terp. In the translation I have kept to the wording as much as possible.  1. kanyavu kadjile, ngoso zyase- nilet). 2. wapilile kala kamhelo.  3. nhonga mbele, ikunwaga min- zi masoga.  4. hambi limo likikalaga manoni avili mahanya, sanga likuta- vuka. 5. hisikilo Iya vunolo henaha.  6. kavusisi?) katuma mhuli.  7. tuli kitisi madutu gafuluma; ulu guma, guhunguluka.  8. tuli kiti$i musoga, gwavelekile, kupila hangi no (h spr. wie ng in lang).  9. tukavile kitisi nsuha, ulu jave- leka, jasumwa hangi, jupila.  10. walivona kunu, alisi uko lililoka kulivona xo.

(Kwihonga = to give and receive a gift, i.e. to keep the polite form)?  If two large birds sit on a branch, it will break.  This is the starting point of the ulcers. (For example: This is where the dog is buried.) The little ant chases the elephant away.  We are like the budding leaves of the trees that fall off when they are withered.  We are like the water jug, when it is broken, it is no longer whole.  We are not like the gourd, which, when cracked, is mended and becomes whole again.

Songs.  If I conclude my remarks on the spiritual possessions of the Wanjamwesi with a small selection of songs, I must first make a few remarks on the poetry of the Wanjamwesi in general, the origin of their songs and their place in the life of the people. First of all, it should be noted that the song cannot be regarded as an independent artistic product. Rather, it appears merely as a by-product of dance and as an accompanying form of rhythmic expression. The Wanjamwesi have a very strongly developed feeling and a passionate preference for rhythm. While an understanding of harmony is almost completely lacking in the musical field and melody also shows only meagre beginnings, all musical feeling is concentrated on sharp beat and rhythm. This is particularly evident in the popular "ngoma", the drum dance, in which all the music, if you want to call it that, is played by several graduated wooden drums, a kind of kettle drum, which is covered with antelope skin on top - there are usually three of them. Each of the participating drums has its own rhythm, the sound and sonic effect of which is difficult for European ears to understand and disentangle. The main rhythm, the basso continuo so to speak, is provided by the bass drum, whose slower beats are supported by the constant hand clapping of the dancers. The choir of dancers forms a closed circle around the drum band and moves in a slow sliding and stamping step in the round during the performance. To the sharp rhythmic sounds of the drums, lead dancers move within the circle in fantastic leaps and constant contortions of the limbs, their movements sometimes flowing calmly and tensely, sometimes escalating into ecstatic forms. This dance is accompanied, as it were, by an alternating song between the lead dancer and the dance choir in such a way that the lead dancer starts a verse and the choir repeats the refrain again and again. This is the actual place of origin for most songs, as the lead dancers are both lead singers and poets. Skilled lead dancers improvise the songs during the dance. The songs created in this way soon make the rounds throughout the country and are sung everywhere and at all kinds of work until they are replaced by new songs. The form of the melody is very simple and almost always in a minor key. Descending motifs are very popular. The choir sings either in unison or accompanied by parallel fifths.        !) For the Wanjamwesi, the hyena is the image of greed and insatiability. If it comes to a wog crossing on its nightly forays, it would like to tear itself in two, as the W. claim, in order to be able to search all paths for food at the same time.  ?) Said by someone who never gets enough and always thinks it is better and more beautiful elsewhere (cf. the fairy tale of the glutton). 


Page 251

However, the strong sense of rhythm is not only evident in dance, but also in everyday life and work. The Munjamwesi has a need to live out his life rhythmically. Each of his work activities is therefore, so to speak, applied rhythm. The porter moves in a dance step while singing and yodeling and beats the beat with the stick on his box. The woman with the black pot on her head prances to the waterhole with a swaying step, singing a little song. The corn stamper accompanies the hard beat of the stomping wood with the latest dance song. The axe in the forest, the hoe in the field becomes the rhythmic instrument. I once watched a group of workers tilling a field on a plantation. A lead dancer was jumping up and down in front of them with grotesque contortions of his limbs, singing and clapping his hands to set the beat for the hoes. All these phenomena reveal the strong dependence of the song on dance and rhythmic movement, and it is only from this premise that the following song samples can be understood.  1st carrier song. Tandagulile kawavaje, maßi- Arbeite, Väterchen, sie ist hart langa kawavaje, nijande mukoji! die Arbeit, mein Väterchen, drum will ich singen, ich Arbeiter!  2nd song about the railroad.  Liladule igari mwa Kalunde, The railroad will Kalundes vupagati vose vufwe. Mukawine, Empire pierce and all carriers lyadula masilima? Lilikoja silanga; service will die. Have you not lyavitile Pugu.

She has passed Pugu, you young people, Kisserawe is a station and Lungerengere, my friend. She is doing a very hard work.  3. from a little bird.  Kanoni kalya musenga-kuva- maju; kanoni kalya musenga di- dilidi!  The little bird ate sand for the mothers, the little bird ate sand didilidi!  4th lullaby.  Mwana walila, mutwali kuli nina, lululu! lintanda, lululu! lembeladje kana, lembela kana kane, kana kane nikamwi! Lembele kana kane, lembeladje, kana lembele, kana kane.  Why are you crying, child? Your mother is carrying you. Shh! shh! or the gorilla will come. Just be quiet child, be quiet, my child, my dear child! Listen to me! Listen to me. Hush, hush, my little child, just hush, my dear child!  5. farewell to the white sacrificial goat.  Mbuli jane jape jaminzagnla ja kudjana kuwinga, na ja kudjana kuvulugu :/: vuli mbuli jane ja- minzagula :/:  My white goat is sprinkled (with flour porridge = consecration offering) to take it to the wedding and take it to war; it is my white goat that is consecrated.  17*

When I recently had the opportunity to carefully reread the work 'Idea de una nueva historia general de la America Septentrional' published in 1746 by the Chevalier Lorenzo Boturini Benaduci, the famous Italian historian and traveler who spent eight years in Mexico, I came across data that shed a completely new light on the origin of cultivated maize, and I hasten to communicate these facts to all those who, like me, are interested in the difficult problem that has so far resisted all the efforts of modern researchers. Chevalier Boturini, famous as the possessor of the largest collection of ancient Mexican illuminated manuscripts and documents ever assembled, came to Mexico in 1735 and spent the next eight years in enthusiastic research into the ancient history of the country, a subject of which he says that its memory 'is dying out, and which may justly demand to be snatched from the grave of oblivion'.  In the preface to his work, Boturini says that "in researching historical facts, he has exposed himself to all the rigors of the climate and endless discomforts and has often traveled long distances without finding shelter ..."  That he was also an enthusiastic admirer and observer of nature is shown by his occasional remark: 'In describing the tufts on the ears of corn, I will use the elegant metaphor "golden curls", for agriculture has always been an object of enchanting charm for me.2)" 1) The following essay by the well-known Americanist Mrs. Zelia Nuttall in Coyoacan, Mexico, is to appear in the "Journal of Heredity".
