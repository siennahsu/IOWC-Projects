9 The Msalala.  By missionary Fr. Desoignies.  I. General information. The Bana Msalala or Bmsalala belong to the Banvamwesi peoples of the Birnana family. [Their land belongs to the northern Unyamwesi landscapes; it lies between the landscapes of Kisinda, Usambiro, Rungua and Umanda (PErers l.e.: 8. 187, 233). Cvsr speaks of the Watusi, a foreign people who came from the north, who used to tyrannize the Wanyamwesi, were subjugated and dispersed after the unification and uprising of the latter under Mirambo and now herd the herds of the Wanyamwesi). Sruntmann knows the Watussi as a group of the Wahuma?), a collective name which designates various Hamitic tribes who migrated from the north-east into the area between the lakes as pastoral tribes 3). Our author also refers to these Watusi as the shepherds of the Bamsalala. The Bamsalala are a hitherto little known part of the Wanyamwesi]. They live off the fruits of the land: manioc, patatoes, peas, beans and peanuts. Sometimes they also eat meat. The men do not use any special food, although they eat separately. (Mainly on this separate food of the men (the 4) Cust l. c.: p. 368 according to Bruyox, son-in-law of King MırAnBo.  ?) STUHLMANN 1. c.: p. 768. ®) Ib.: p. 842. Cf. further on the history of Wanyamwesis: Baumann: "Durch Massailand zur Nilquelle'' 1894: p. 110ff., 227 fi. and H. Wıssmanx: "Unter deutscher Flagge quer durch Afrika" 1889: p. 253 ff.

(which allows a quite different explanation!)) and on the much rarer and probably never profound difference between men's and women's food, the ingenious Leipzig economist Bücher has built his hypothesis of the individual search for food, according to which men and women seek their sustenance independently of each other and of which condition he claims to be able to prove the remains even in higher savages?) It seems to me that this neat hypothesis is based on an exaggeration of some of the facts recorded by VoX DEN Steinen, LuxmHorsz and others and contains a very forced misinterpretation of the alleged "survival". The division of labor between men and women and the Fran's share in the formation of gainful employment was very inadequately addressed by ©. Turrox-Masox: "Woman's Share in Primitive Culture", 1895. The whole highly important subject has never been discussed in detail.  Splendid material for Africa is given by Schurtrz in his beautiful and stimulating: "Afrikanisches Gewerbe", 1900: 8. 7-28.] The young women deny themselves chickens and guinea fowls, [Cf. Schurtz: "Speiseverbote", 1893.] The Bana Msalala claim to have come from Bumanda and Handa, areas neighboring the Msalala. They are settled, but every year a certain number go to the coast as porters.  In the rainy season, men and women cultivate the land; in the dry season, the men trade, while the women harvest and the children tend the goats and sheep. The horned cattle are entrusted to the Watusi herding people.  Their language is Chiruana ([? illegible]), a dialect of Kinyamwesi.  II. Family relationships. The degrees of kinship are like those in Europe. The uncle, especially the paternal one, is often called father and his nephew son.  !)

Kinship is mediated by the father and mother. Adoption occurs and also establishes kinship.  The father is called baba, the mother mayo, the grandfather ngukn, the grandmother mama, the paternal uncles and aunts isengi, (the maternal uncles and aunts manai, the brother mzuma, the sister humbu, the nephew myala, the brother-in-law mkwera, the sister-in-law mkueru, the son-in-law mkuirima, the father-in-law mkuye, the mother-in-law nina buknui, the uncle's wife kumba, (the adoptive father baba mundi, the adoptive mother nina mundi. The ascendants (father, grandfather, etc.) are called babye, the other relatives are called badugu (plural), mdugu (singular).  Like the other peoples of Equatorial Africa, the Bana Msalala also form blood friendship alliances with the purpose of helping each other and, if necessary, taking revenge. [Schurrz: "Altersklassen" p. 126 ff.; he forgets, however, the hypothesis that the brotherhood of choice occurs especially where the disruption of the natural, sexual, cooperative bond makes a sırrogate, a new bond for the protection of the individual desirable, when the protection of the state is still lacking]. Most relatives contribute to the payment of a fine, especially the father and grandfather, the eldest brother and the uncle. The ascendants, brothers and sisters also buy the prisoner's freedom if it is within their means.  The women, if the man has several, never live in a hut. [The chiefs possess a very large number of wives; in Usukuma only they have more than two wives; the highest pride of a chief in Sunguisi is the inordinate number of his children. Baumann 1. c.: 8. 110, 235; Tuowsox: "To the Central Afrikan Lakes and Back", 1881: 8. 244 ff.] Each woman keeps a separate household in her own hut. Among the great chiefs, however, the women, bakoli, are subordinated to one of them, musale muhanye [muhamja ?, indistinctly written], for "the work in the fields. Each woman has a number of slaves, men and women, under her. The children of the Hanpt woman are not favored for inheritance. [The higher position is therefore probably more a requirement (of labor supervision than a consequence of the greater inclination of the husband or the social position of the wife.


Page 271

Woman. Most of the work is done by the women; the men do the field work, but when this is finished, the men laze around or, if it is absolutely necessary, they build a new hut and fetch firewood, and they also like to go into the forest to set traps and look for honey. The women, however, grind the flour and fetch water every day. Crafts are also practiced by the men. Reıcwarpr 1. c.: 8.315, 319.]  The unmarried young people, even before puberty, live separately from the married couples in small huts, the young men in the mabanza and the young girls similarly in the mhasi. [Cf. the interesting remarks by Schurrz: "Altersklassen und Männerbünde", 1902: p. 83 ff]. At meal times the men are united and (the women apart with the small children. The chiefs usually take their meals with their mjamparas.  The kings and the great chiefs are elected, otherwise the father is the head of the family, if he is absent, the eldest brother; the grandmother is honored and consulted. The head of the family has a fairly large responsibility for the offenses of his subordinates. Although the families, especially those of the great ones, are very similar to the old patriarchal families, the father cannot exercise the right of life and death without the permission of the king or of his chief. He does, however, have the right to chastise his subjects, which he rarely exercises, at least not through corporal punishment. If a slave tries to run away, his master may cut off his ear and lock him in the stocks; if he relapses, he almost always sells him to the coast. [It is very clear here how the punishments inflicted on the slave are moderated out of pecuniary consideration and how, on the other hand, they have an educational character, which necessity forced them to do; they had to be lived with, they had to be used! Thus the disciplinary punishments inflicted on the slaves had to contribute to changing the old impulsive character of the revenge reaction. Cf. Stemuerz: "Punishment" II: pp. 306-315].     If the father kills his son, the mother's relatives can demand compensation. The chief also demands a great penance for the killing of this son, regardless of whether the killing was justified or not. For


Page 272

the killing of a slave, the head of the household must also pay a fine to the king and the chief.  When the head of the family marries, he takes his wife into his house.  The chief can expel unruly people, which he rarely does, but the great ones banish from their land those relatives who are a nuisance to them. A child chased away by his father seeks a home with his mother's uncle, manai. [The mother's family obviously still exercises a certain protection over the children; the contrast between the paternal and maternal line certainly had a beneficial effect on the children!) ReıcHarpr tells us that the maternal uncle has a consultative voice in the naming process and also helps the parents to choose a name for the child. L. c.: pp. 255, 258.]  Marriage is polygamous, and as a rule each man takes as many wives as he can pay for. There are, however, exceptions. Polyandry is unknown.  Not officially, but in fact there are temporary and trial marriages. Passion and whim mainly determine the marriages of the Wanyamwesi, who marry and live in their own village or elsewhere.  They also mix with their female slaves; the older ones almost always give their adult children young slaves in marriage until a better match presents itself. However, a free woman never marries her own slave, but rather someone else's.  A distinction is made in Msalala between different types of marriage: 1. butosi: the actual and most common marriage: the man buys the woman for a price, higher or lower, depending on whether she is noble, merely free or a slave; 2. Kubola: no bride price, usually with slave women; however, if the woman is free, she can dissolve the relationship as she wishes; her father, although married to a kubola, can sell her to a butosi husband; 3. kuyanzwa: rather a concubinage as a result of sexual intercourse; if the woman becomes pregnant, the man must pay her parents compensation).  !) STEINMETZ: "Strafe" II: p. 89 fi. ®) Post: "African Jurisprudence" I: p. 329 ff., 355 ff.


Page 273

The butosi marriage is prepared as follows: the young man, accompanied by other young men, first visits the girl's parents and eats a goat with them, or he sends them his representatives to open the manenos (negotiations); this is called kndata uhinya (tasting marriage). Then the representatives and the other young people go to have a good time with the girl's parents and finish the negotiations; then the bride's father sends young people (nyamparas) to the man's emissary or to the man himself to have a good time there: new feast. In both cases this is called kulya bukombe. Finally, the young man sends to his father-in-law to fetch the bride: kumbeta muhinya. This last ceremony is the actual marriage. If the parties are rich, a great feast is now organized, on the way to the man's home gifts are offered to the bride's father every time the bride rests. At the end of the party, the husband gives his mother-in-law a small gift to indicate that his wife is now leaving the home of the young girls, mhasi.  The father receives the price for his daughter; if she dies within a year, he returns the price or finds the son-in-law another wife [Baumann: p. 235]; if the husband sends the wife back within the same period, he can also reclaim her price; but if the wife dies before the price has been paid in full, he has to pay her father compensation, depending on her social status.  Barter marriages are possible, but very rare. Engagements are annulled without adverse consequences. Child betrothals and child marriages are also common, especially among the nobility. Rarely do very young children marry, often young people of adolescent age; the girl often before she is sexually mature, the young man as soon as he has reached maturity.  Even distant relatives do not marry each other. Marriages between siblings are absolutely forbidden by custom, decency and superstition.  Marriages usually take place in the dry season (kipura, kipwa [?]) [also Reıcharpr: 255]. Virgins or the stonemasons, legal relationships, 18


Page 274

fir such are highly valued and sought after. Young people see each other often and only too intimately ("pour faire le mal"). [? Both sayings almost contradict each other. Among the Wanyamwesi, sexual intercourse begins for boys at the age of 12 and 13, for girls at the age of 8 and 9, which of course soon makes them old. Reıcharpr 1. c.: p. 305. Cameron tells of the very obscene dances that the two men perform, but not with each other, although in public. "Across Africa", 1877, I: 8. 190. On the free love of young people, see Schurrz: "Altersklassen und Männerbünde", 1902: pp. 85-94 and passim; J. Mürzer: "Das sexuelle Leben der Natur- völker", 1900: 8. 25 ff].  The spouses avoid their parents-in-law when they meet them outside their own home. [AnprEE: "Ethno- graphische Parallelen", 1889: p. 159.] When one of the spouses dies, the survivor and the relatives on both sides mourn for about three months. The widower stays at home for five days without ever going out, he shaves his head and wraps the ornaments on his arms and legs with rags; his closest relatives and those of the deceased do the same. [Wirken attributes the reason for this widespread, notable custom to the fear of the spirit of the dead not yet satisfied by a funeral feast, which drives the relatives to make themselves unrecognizable before the spirit by masking themselves. "The Hair Sacrifice" Revue Coloniale Internat. 1886: 8. 20 ff. Frazer: "Certain burial customs as illustrative of the primitive theory of the soul", in Journ. Anthrop. Instit. XV. Jacoss has attempted to reject the Wırxen interpretations of these and related customs, as it seems to me, without success, in his "Het Familie- en Kampongleven op Groot-Atjeh", 1894, I: p. 340. Rich material for these studies is given by Yarrow: "Mortuary Customs among N. Am. Indians", Report. Bur. of Ethnology, 1380; Tu. Preuss: "Die Begräbnisarten der Amerikaner und Nordostasiaten", 1894; Stemmerz: "Strafe" I: pp. 141-298].  The husband can always send his wife back, the paid wife cannot leave at will. The children of the divorced or repatriated wife are not disinherited, even if they remain with their mother. Divorced


Page 275

Husbands can remarry. [, "Peuvent se remarier", also each other?] Many young girls give themselves up to prostitution, but their parents do not prostitute them. Illegitimate sexual intercourse, which is condoned by custom, takes place at night during public dances; the couples withdraw with full consent ("pour perpötuer leurs actes infames").  When a child is born, regardless of its sex, there is joy in the family: the father slaughters a goat and invites his relatives and friends to the meal. If the child is a girl, the parents are all the happier because it will bring in money when she marries later. For 5-6 months the mother does not drink pombe, called malulu, or any drink made from the fruit of a certain tree (tamarind); the spouses do not have sexual relations during pregnancy and after the birth. The crippled children are cared for and brought up just as well as the others. Of twins, the first is always called kulwa and the second doto; two goats are then slaughtered; when one of them dies, a small object kakulu is hung on the neck of the other. If a single child is born and comes out with its head last, it is called kashindye. Every bearded woman as well as her neighbors and friends must perform kütua, a ceremony that consists of rubbing the excrement of a large snake (chatu) on the forehead, shoulders, arms, back and legs.  The corpses are thrown into the forest (pori) where the hyenas eat them, only the nobles and aristocrats are buried. [According to Baumann, the dead are thrown into the bush among the Wasumbwa, only the chief is buried on his chair; in Usukuma, on the other hand, all corpses are buried lying on their side with their legs raised, but one chief is buried with his right leg elevated on clay earth). It is not entirely clear whether the Manyuöma do not at least simply throw away the women's bodies like the Wanyamwesi). The burial customs of these peoples are very different].     1) Baumann: "Durch Massailand zur Nilquelle (1894): p. 236; STUHLMANN 1. c.: p. 186. 2) "The last Journals of D. Lıvınastone" II: pp. 25, 143. 18*


Page 276

A child born in the usual way is given a name according to the circumstances of its birth: Kabula if it rains at birth, Limi if it is born during the day, Kwesi if it is born at full moon, or the name of some object or profession (Mkwabi, trader). No religious ceremony takes place at birth, only some superstitious acts. Circumcision is unknown [also among the Wanyamwesi, ReıcHarpr: p. 253]. Puberty and majority are reached without special declarations. [When a girl begins to menstruate among the Wanyamwesi, the women hold a great feast; the girl is then no longer a virgin; she is washed by the fetish woman, Wagonga, rubbed and spat on with flour water from the mouth of the Wagonga, she has to perform various movements, probably the coitus movements, as she only learns this; no man is allowed to be present. Rrıcuarpr.c.: 8.254, 304. The Wanyamwesi boy of 7 or 8 years frees himself from his mother's authority and spends almost all his time in the clubhouse, where he sleeps and eats. Cameron: "Across Africa" 1877 I: p. 181; see Scuurtz: "Alterklassen und Männerbünde" 1902. On the early maturity of primitive children see Sremwuerz: "Verhältnis zwischen Eltern und Kindern bei den Naturvölkern", Z. £. Socialw. 1898: p. 623 ff.; Pross: "Kind" II: p. 334 ff.]| In times of extreme need during famine, the Bamsalala probably sell their children.  The women can act as witnesses and even become queen (mtemi) or village chief if the birth entitles them to this. [Wısssann: p. 271 and Caneron: p. 178 know of such queens] Otherwise they have no rights, they hardly inherit anything to cover their nakedness.  The sick and old are not abandoned; if married, they remain in their homes; if old and widowed, they are taken to small huts intended for this purpose, where their relatives bring them food and look after them more or less well.  HI. Succession. The right of inheritance corresponds to the degree of kinship: sons, brothers, uncles, nephews. Women do not inherit, except for clothing. Sons also inherit their father's wives. The inheritance consists of cloth, ivory and women. All this is distributed among the sons, but the eldest (muene kaya) is preferred. The heirs are not liable


Page 277

for the debts of the deceased; the unpaid creditors forfeit all their rights upon the death of the debtor. The testator's last wishes are taken into account, especially if they are reasonable.  IV. Political organization. The royal dignity has become only a name. A certain number of chiefs have made themselves independent of the king (mtemi); these have become much more powerful than he. These great chiefs have a number of vassals under them, who blindly obey them and therefore abandon the king, who no longer has any authority. [Cf. Cameron 1. c. I: p. 211. The great king Mmampo of Graganza, an upstart, truly exercised no nominal authority over his vast territory; he was greatly feared, even superstitious, he was thought to never sleep, to be able to fly, to be invulnerable. Wıssmanx 1. c.: 8. 259.]  On the death of the king, the great and the nobles in the capital unite to appoint his successor, whom they always choose from the sons-in-law of the deceased, never from his own sons [either a curious remnant of maternal rights in this strictly paternal people, or a special consequence of distrust of the marital fidelity of the royal wives]. Except in this one case there are no other assemblies of the people. Each chief governs his district quite arbitrarily. Women, even if they are village chiefs, take no part in the election of the mtemi. [Cameron found as head of all Unynyemb&, a part of Unyamwesi, a daughter of Mxasıwan, 1.c.I: 8. 178.] At the time when the mtemi still possessed effective power, there were people in all the districts who were acquainted with the administration of justice; they were called ba natschalo; this dignity, too, is now almost a mere name; it is hereditary from father to son.  The population of Msalala is divided into three castes: 1. the nobility, bananguas or bizikuru; the sons of the former bear the latter name and vice versa, alternating from one family to the other. [Only the chiefs, Mtemmi, and the nobility, Mgane, may wear lion and panther skins, ReıcHarprl. c.: p.309]. The nobility is not lost and is not acquired. But a man of the people may marry a daughter of a nobleman.


Page 278

marry, the children are also noble because of their mother [a second "survival" of maternal law; interesting discussions on similar remnants, from which conclusions could be drawn about former maternal law, are contained in G. A. Wırken's treatises: "De verbreiding van het Matriarchaat op Sumatra", 1888, "Over het huwelyks- en erfrecht by de volken van Zwid-Sumatra", 1891, "Het Matriarchaat by de oude Arabieren" 1884 and Darsun's "Mutterrecht und Vater- recht", 1892, "Mutterrecht und Raubehe und ihre Reste im ger- manischen Recht und Leben", 1883. MorsAn, Mc LENNAN, BERNHÖFT ("Verwandtschaftsnamen und Eheformen der Nordamerikanischen Volksstämme") and Konter ("Zur Urgeschichte der Ehe") use the same, folkloristic, method with a preference for kinship names. Cf. on this method STEINMETZ: "Die neueren Forschungen zur Geschichte der menschlichen Familie", Z. f. Socialwissenschaft 1899, p. 68. Socialwissenschaft 1899, p. 687 £f.]; 2. the bazengis or free men, who are free to act according to the laws of the land; 3. the slaves who are bought or prisoners of war or descended from slaves. The child of a slave with a free woman (rare case) is a slave, not that of a slave woman with a free man. The master has the fullest right over his slave, but if he kills him without cause, he must pay a fine to his chief [Baumann: 8.237: the rather numerous slaves are treated well. As in all neighboring countries, there are rainmakers and sorcerers or doctors; their means consist mainly of superstitious tricks. The sorcerers often accuse innocent people of being poisoners, especially in the deaths of nobles. The Wanyamwesi are convinced that death is always caused by misimus or balongi (poisoners). The bafümü [?] (sorcerers) sacrifice to the spirits of the dead (misimü) when a caravan is traveling to the coast, a sick person is to be healed or an enterprise must succeed. To discover a poisoner, the batümü cut up live chickens and pretend to read the names of the culprits in the entrails. They are sacrificial priests, doctors and magicians at the same time. The people have only superstitious customs instead of religion. [The Wanyamwesi are infinitely indifferent to all religion. Baumann: p. 239] They honor the misimü by erecting very small huts (shigabiro) for them and by killing the snakes that enter their


Page 279

They respect the hyenas that come to their homes, convinced that the spirit of an ancestor has entered this visiting snake. They also refrain from killing hyenas.  For protection against wild animals and misfortunes, they wear a lot of amulets.  In one or two districts of Msalala there are secret religious societies, called basuözi, which are said to perform infernal dances to heal the seriously ill; these meetings take place at night and in the forest; only initiated men and women are admitted. These associations were introduced here by the bana mü&ri (men of the West) from the Basumbwas countries, where the basuözi are very numerous.  As with most Negroes, industry is poorly developed. However, one finds blacksmiths who make hoes and spades and mostly belong to the Balonga people; wood craftsmen who make bowls, armchairs, etc.; potters, only women; basket makers who make large baskets to store provisions (mafiima); women who make bowls from very narrow wickerwork, from which pombe (a goose-ear drink made from mama) is drunk.  Freedom of hospitality is practiced against all; however, trading strangers are sometimes plundered at the instigation of the chief, who is always the real culprit in such cases.  The chief is often blamed for all public or private misfortunes, but without any consequences for him.  The chiefs can demand personal services and receive gifts from their subjects; there are no fixed dates for the collection of steners, which are more voluntary gifts. As a sign of subservience, people who prepare pombe almost always bring something to the chief. [In some parts of Unyamwesis there is such a political fragmentation that the villages are not connected at all, even hamlets of six families are independent, (which is why the inhabitants are easy prey for slave raiders and are often forced to live in caves and rock holes, (which can be easily defended. Caueron I: pp. 216, 220]  V. Judiciary. The simple village chiefs do not administer justice; they are only overseers. Only when the chief commissions them to do so do they administer justice, but (this is seldom the case; he speaks


Page 280

He usually makes the judgment himself and entrusts the execution of the sentence to the nyampara, the slave he has with him at the time. In case of doubt as to whether someone is guilty of sorcery, for example, the bafümü decide.  VI Revenge, penance and punishment. The talion only exists for murderers who refuse to pay the blood price - a rare case. When a murderer escapes, his relatives always pay the composition to the relatives of the victims and collect it (nkoba) among themselves. Usually the chief does not interfere at all. However, if after the perpetrator's escape his relatives refuse to pay the composition, the victim's relatives take revenge on one of the murderer's relatives. If a slave was killed by a mzengi (not the master), the free man must pay the blood price or become a slave himself. But the nobles never become slaves, except as prisoners of war. If the noble murderer of a foreign slave refuses to pay the blood price, the chief deals with the matter. If a slave murders, his master pays for him, unless he prefers to hand the slave over to the death of revenge. [The composition seems to be so deeply ingrained and widespread among the Wanyamwesi, even between families of a tribe and village, that it contributes to making the children even less childlike and funny than they already are: all wild playing and fighting among the boys is immediately prevented, as the parents would immediately demand compensation for every drop of blood accidentally spilled. Rerıcharpr: "Die Wanyamwesi", Z. d Gesellsch. f. Erdkunde. Berlin 1889: p. 259].  A married woman is avenged by her relatives who, united with her husband, demand the blood price for her. Expulsion for murder, for example, does not take place if the culprit voluntarily emigrates; outside his country he is unassailable; but this exposes one of his relatives to talion if they do not prefer to pay the blood price to the offended family.  Only traitors, rebels, those who rape the wife of a great chieftain and poisoners are punished by death. For the last crime, the judge is almost always also the plaintiff, because he covets the goods of the accused or wants to free himself from one of his own wives. [Among the Wanyamwesi, Incest


Page 281

and sorcery are punishable by death, as is theft, but sometimes the punishment is not carried out. There is a lot of robbery, especially when a tribe is working in the fields; many unguarded mothers and children are robbed, probably also tired porters. The robbers, Ruga Ruga, are honored for their courage, especially by the women whose favor they gain with their booty. Reıcharpr: "Wanyamwesi", Z. d. V. f£. Erdkunde in Berlin 1889, pp. 255, 307].  The fines for manslaughter, theft, adultery, etc., vary according to the position of the persons injured; the woman who causes abortion by any means has to pay a fine, but the guilty woman or girl receives only a reprimand. Domestic animals that cause the death of a person shall be killed.  VI Land and soil conditions. The land belongs to the chief, who agrees with the village heads to distribute the land among the inhabitants. Each family of free men (bazengis) has a plot of land, which is usually inherited from father to son. With the abundance of free land, it is not difficult to satisfy everyone.  VII Rights to movable property. The inhabitants own their huts and their tools. Lost property is returned to the owner only after payment of a reward according to the value of the object and the status of the owner; the reward usually rises to half the value. [According to Reıcnaror 1. c.: 8. 307, the Wanyam- wesi concept of property is very elastic, yet the thief is greatly despised and regarded as a sorcerer].  IX. Traffic conditions. Witness, glass beads, spades, twine, goats and probably also cows constitute the money of the country. Actual money is almost unknown. The purchase is considered completed when the parties have spat on the ground (bafupre); whoever then renounces pays a fine. The buyer can cancel the contract within three days if the animals or goods sold have hidden defects. The loan is subject to interest, but this is rare. The debtor must repay the creditor at least twice the principal sum. Guarantee is unknown because credit is never given, with the possible exception of

in the small culture, but then the publisher lowers the price if the farmer has not kept his promise).  Some chiefs used to make the caravan of Europeans pay hongo and plunder that of the blacks, but since the German occupation this has stopped; on the contrary, the chiefs now give gifts to the Europeans and leave the blacks in peace. When the black traders give gifts to the chiefs whose villages they pass, they now do so out of friendship or respect.  1) In addition to Post's and Kohler's works, K. Frieprich's "Universales Obligationenrecht" (1896) is very useful for the study of the commercial and contractual relationships of primitive peoples.
