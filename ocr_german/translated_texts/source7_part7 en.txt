Legal conditions in East Africa. Ven Carl v. Stengel, Professor of Law in Würzburg. In No. 42 and 43 of the weekly journal "Das Ausland" (1890), under the title "Rechtszustände in Ostafrika. Eine juristischethnologische Studie von Adolf Fleischmann in München" (Legal and ethnological study by Adolf Fleischmann in Munich), which contains various inaccuracies and errors regarding the validity of German laws for the "indigenous" population of the East African protectorate. Since "Ausland" is a magazine that is as widely read as it is respected, it seems appropriate to briefly discuss the legal situation of the indigenous population of the East African protectorate, the Arabs as well as the other indigenous tribes, in accordance with the laws applicable to the German protectorates: First of all, the author points out that in German East Africa the coastal country and the hinterland (inland) are to be distinguished with regard to the legal status, as in the coastal country we have to do with the firmly established right of the Jolam, which is imported there and also relatively high in status, while the tribes of the inland are only slightly affected by this right and have highly undeveloped and crude legal statuses. After the author has attempted to give a brief sketch of the legal views of some of these tribes (the Maasai, the Usambara, etc.), he raises the following two questions (p. 844), pointing out that the entire population of the protectorate has been in contact with the Arabs, who have their law codified in the Koran, for centuries, and that, on the other hand, German laws have already been introduced in all German protectorates: How does it relate to the presumption of law that all citizens, i.e. all inhabitants of the protectorate, know the law just mentioned and may not plead ignorance of the law as an excuse in the event of violations of the law? 2. how do the German laws that have been introduced relate to the Islamic legal views already inherent in the coastal inhabitants? In answering these questions, the author points out that the legal relations of the German protectorates are regulated by the Imperial Law of April 17, 1886. This law expresses the principle that only members of the Reich and protectorates are subject to German law, i.e. not the natives for the time being; but that the Emperor has the right to determine by decree that other persons, i.e. also the natives, i.e. all members of the indigenous tribes and the members of the colored tribes, should also be subject to German law. "From this it follows, says Mr. Fleischmann, that the introduced German laws are already binding for all Arabs, because they do not belong to any colored tribe. The author considers the resulting ambiguity of the legal system for the members of the empire, protectors and Arabs on the one hand and the colored natives on the other hand to be untenable and therefore considers it undoubted that in a short time the German laws will have to be declared valid and binding for the natives as well. These remarks on the legal situation in German East Africa, namely on the validity of German laws for the Arabs and the colored natives, which are reproduced as accurately as possible in the foregoing, are partly inaccurate and partly incorrect, as the following brief explanation will show: Despite their name, which gives rise to misunderstandings, the German protectorates are not merely protectorate countries dependent on the Reich under international law, but territories subject to the sovereignty of the Reich. However, this sovereignty is for the most part only a theoretical or, if you like, a paper one, since in reality one can only speak of being subject to sovereignty where it manifests itself in state institutions and in the assertion of state power, which is only the case in individual parts of the protectorates. However, on the basis of the validly executed acquisition of the protectorates, the Empire is legally in a position to assert its sovereignty in all protectorates and in all their parts without having to fear the objection of another state. From the fact that the protectorates are subject to the sovereignty of the German Reich, two consequences arise which are relevant here: 1. the Reich is authorized to exercise, or have exercised, all state authority in the protectorates, i.e. to make laws. To administer justice and develop administrative activity. (2) In accordance with the principle of territoriality that has become established in modern constitutional law, all persons in the protectorates are subject to legislation, jurisdiction and administration, regardless of whether they are members of the empire, fellow protectors or other Europeans or natives. However, in individual protectorates, individual chiefs have contractually stipulated a certain exemption from German legislation and the administration of justice for themselves and their subjects; this is not the case in the East African protectorate, however, and it is therefore superfluous to discuss the question of how such treaties are to be judged legally. Making use of its sovereign power over the protectorates, the Empire initially regulated the constitutional status and constitution of the protectorates in the law of April 17, 1886, in such a way that the Emperor was assigned the exercise of protective power, i.e. all the powers to which the Empire is entitled in relation to the protectorates. On the basis of this transfer, the Emperor is authorized, in particular, to exercise legislation in the form of decrees, i.e. without the participation of the Imperial Diet, provided that he is not himself restricted in certain areas by the provisions of the Imperial Law of April 17, 1886, as is indeed the case with regard to the administration of justice. As indicated at the end of Fleischmann's essay, the Emperor is therefore in a position to impose direct and indirect taxation on the inhabitants of the protectorates, including the natives, and to impose a tax on them.

 military duty. However, it is not to be expected in the foreseeable future that the German military constitution will be introduced in the protectorates, any more than the French or Dutch have thought of introducing their military laws in their colonies without further ado. With regard to the administration of justice in particular, the Imperial Law of April 17, 1886, stipulated that civil law, criminal law and judicial procedure, including the judicial constitution, in the protectorates shall be governed by the provisions of the Law of April 10, 1879, on consular jurisdiction. According to the Consular Jurisdiction Act, however, the Imperial Criminal Code and the other penal provisions of the Imperial Laws, the Imperial Laws of Justice, the Imperial Laws of Private Law, in particular the Commercial Code and the Code of Bills of Exchange, and finally, in the absence of a general German Civil Code, the Prussian Land Law shall apply in the consular jurisdiction districts. However, according to the Consular Court Act, these laws only apply to German citizens of the Reich and their fellow protectors. In view of the fact that the protectorates subject to German sovereignty and territorial sovereignty occupy a completely different position from the confular court districts, in which the Reich is only able to exercise jurisdiction over certain persons subject to its personal sovereignty, the Emperor has been authorized by § 3 No. 1 of the law of April 17, 1886, to determine by decree that in the protectorates persons other than nationals of the Reich or fellow protectors are also subject to German laws and German jurisdiction. Likewise, the Emperor may order that the Imperial Law of May 4, 1870, on marriage and the certification of the civil status of nationals of the Reich abroad, which is also to be introduced in the protectorates, shall apply to persons other than nationals of the Reich. These "other persons" are the nationals of other civilized states who are not to be regarded as protectorates, the natives. The term "natives" is not defined anywhere in the law; rather, the Reichstag Commission set up to discuss the law of 17 April 1886 expressly acknowledged that a precise definition of the term "native" could not be found in the law itself, and that it must therefore be left to imperial decree to determine those categories of persons who are to be regarded as natives. In fact, it is not so easy to define the term "natives" correctly in individual cases and for the individual protectorates, because this term is not only used to describe the members of the tribes resident in a colony, but also the members of foreign tribes who have immigrated as workers or who reside in the colony in order to trade. The term "natives" therefore does not actually have a positive content, but only designates those persons who are not members of European civilized peoples, or who can be treated in the same way as them, as is often the case with natives who have converted to Christianity. The definition of the term "natives" is therefore a matter for the government, which, as will be explained immediately, has settled this question in most protectorates. Before that, however, attention must be drawn to another point, namely that the Consular Jurisdiction Act and the German and Prussian laws referred to in it did not, as seems to be assumed in the essay in question, come into force in the protectorates of their own accord, but that it was left to the Emperor to introduce them by decree in the individual protectorates. Such ordinances have already been issued for all protected areas. In these introductory ordinances it was then also determined in each case whether the German laws also extended to the natives and which persons were to be regarded as natives Thus, for example, the law on consular jurisdiction of July 10, 1879 was introduced in the territory of the New Guinea Company by imperial ordinance of June 5, 1888 and at the same time it was determined that the natives were only subject to the German courts and German jurisdiction if and insofar as this was expressly decreed. Who is to be regarded as a native was to be determined by the Imperial Chancellor after consultation with the Directorate of the New Guinea Company. Accordingly, on November 1, 1886, the Imperial Chancellor issued a decree that the following are to be regarded as natives 1. the members of the tribes indigenous to the protectorate, 2. the members of other colored tribes. As far as the German East African protectorate in particular is concerned, an imperial decree was issued on November 18, 1887, according to which the law on the jurisdiction of consular courts of July 10, 1879, was to come into force for this protectorate on November 1, 1888. However, the decree does not contain a provision stating that the law of July 10, 1879 is to be extended to persons other than nationals of the Reich and protectorates and which persons are to be regarded as natives. In general, it lacks any more precise introductory provisions and it can therefore be said that the ordinance was not implemented, particularly because of the military and political events that had occurred in East Africa in the meantime. Only now, after the uprising has been suppressed and the new demarcation of the East African protectorate has provided a firm basis for the exercise of German state authority, can the Imperial Government seriously consider the introduction of German laws and German jurisdiction in the protectorate. Mr. Fleischmann now claims on p. 844 that the Arabs living in East Africa are also subject to German law and German jurisdiction, for they are not to be regarded as natives, because only the members of colored tribes are to be regarded as natives He incomprehensibly refers to my treatise on German colonial state law in Hirth's Annalen des Deutschen Reiches 1887 p. 300 ff. and 805 ff. to prove his assertion. I have never made any statement that could be cited as justification for such a gross error, and can only imagine that this error arose as a result of an inadmissible generalization of the content of the above-mentioned decree of the Imperial Chancellor issued solely for New Guinea. East Africa is a very striking example of the fact that it is not possible to regulate the question of which persons are to be regarded as natives and what legal status they are to be granted in general terms for all protectorates, but that each protectorate must be treated separately. In East Africa, the Arabs and the Indians residing there occupy a special position; they cannot be lumped together with the indigenous tribes with regard to the law applicable to them. In East Africa it will probably be necessary to imitate the system adopted in the Netherlands Indies, according to which four groups of persons are distinguished: 1. Europeans and the descendants of Europeans. 2. natives and their descendants, with the exception of those who profess Christianity, 3. persons assimilated to natives, i.e. all non-natives and non-Europeans who are Mohammedans or pagans, mostly immigrant Asians (Chinese, etc.), 4. Persons equated with Europeans, namely the natives who profess Christianity and all those who do not belong to any of the other three groups There is no doubt that in East Africa, just as in the other protectorates, all Europeans and descendants of Europeans can be subjected to German law and German jurisdiction in every respect. In some respects, at least those Arabs, Indians and natives who have converted to Christianity can be placed on an equal footing with Europeans, provided, of course, that they have worked their way up to a cultural level such that they are able to understand German law at least in the regulations that apply to them, e.g. with regard to marriage, because the community of law presupposes a certain commonality of religious, moral and social views. Moreover, it would be the greatest blunder that the German government could commit if it were immediately to declare German laws applicable to the natives, whether they be Arabs or Reger. In particular, one must be careful not to offend the beliefs of the followers of Islam, for whom law is inseparable from religion. Just as in the French and Dutch colonies the Muhammadans were left their rights and their courts in the main and at most mixed courts made up of Muhammadans and Europeans were created, a similar approach can and must be adopted in East Africa. But the other indigenous tribes will also initially have to be left to their legal customs Only gradually, as can only be hinted at here, will they be subordinated to German law.1) That nevertheless the natives, Arabs. Indians, etc., as well as all other persons in the protectorate, will be subject to certain police, financial and criminal laws. The answer to the questions formulated by Mr. Fleischmann is self-evident: Since the German laws do not come into force for the natives, including the Arabs and Indians, *) Cf. my essay on this: "Die rechtliche Stellung der Eingeborenen in den deutschen Schußgedieten", Kolonial=Zeitung 1887 p. 363 ff. and p. 396 fl.

they do not need to know them either, and the German laws do not affect the Islamic legal views any more than other legal habits and customs of the natives in force in the protectorate. It need not be emphasized that this does not include the slave trade, while on the other hand slavery cannot be abolished so easily even among the natives. The ambivalence of every legal system for the Europeans on the one hand and for the indigenous tribes, as well as for the immigrant Arabs and Indians, can therefore not be avoided for a long time. The way in which the shortcomings of these ambiguities can be at least partially eliminated cannot be explained further here. However, it should be pointed out repeatedly here that before the legal relations of the natives of our protectorates can be regulated, the legal conditions as they currently exist must first be researched and established in a reliable and authentic manner. The occasional information provided by travelers who are generally not legally educated is by no means sufficient in this respect. In contrast to the inaccuracies that can be found in the statement "Legal Conditions in East Africa", an attempt has been made above, albeit very briefly, to present the "legal conditions" as they actually are according to the relevant legal regulations. It is very gratifying that the legal conditions of our protectorates are now also being discussed in non-legal journals by non-lawyers, but if this is done, it is very much to be hoped that the explanations in question are based on sufficient legal knowledge, so that the lack of clarity that still exists in many cases among the public with regard to the legal conditions in our protectorates is not further increased. The question of labor in East Africa. We have received the following comments from an expert who has been called upon to make a judgment based on several years of practical work in East Africa "Recently, the question has been raised from various sides as to what extent the indigenous regent material in East Africa is suitable and sufficient for the work that German colonization entails, especially for plantation construction. The question of a possible introduction of Chinese labor was also raised. Although in principle there are no objections to such an experimental introduction, I believe that it is at least premature. The Chinese are mainly used for plantation construction, for work that requires special skill and speed in performance; for work such as railroad construction, road construction, house construction, etc., the Reger are certainly good enough and much cheaper. And that it should not be possible to recruit Reger in sufficient numbers for such work, which is especially required by the government, seems to me at least not yet proven. As far as plantation cultivation is concerned, it is not necessarily possible to mix up all the products. The Chinese would probably only be considered primarily for tobacco dew, vanilla, coffee, indigo, and so on. (As the article in No. 23 of the Kol.=Ztg. recommends importing Chinese, I consider this to be completely out of the question for the time being. As far as I know, these crops do not yet exist in German East Africa, or only on a very small scale (e.g. vanilla at the French mission station in Bagamoyo). It will therefore at least be possible to try the same and other crops with regers for the time being, in order to import foreign labor later, in the event of unfavorable experiences. With regard to tobacco plantations, I cite as an example the Lewa plantation, which is said to have had plenty of people before the uprising and before the devastation by Buschiri; also two plantations on the island of Zanzibar, which did not suffer from a lack of people at the time of their activity. I admit that Zanzibar is superior to the mainland in this respect. The Zanzibar negro is also more intelligent and more employable than the mainland negro. This is of course very beneficial to a plantation entrepreneur. Physically, he is on average not as tough as the mainland negro, but this makes less of a difference in plantation building. I know from many Zanzibar negroes, men as well as women, that they can do all the manipulations that are important in tobacco cultivation quite well and quickly, such as planting, watering, heaping, and tilling: Planting, watering, heaping, heading, pickling, harvesting, fermenting and even sorting.*) On this question, please compare my essay in the Grenzbote II. 1890 p. 529 fl.: "Die Rechtsverhältnisse der Eingeborenen in den deutschen Schutzgedieten" The German East African Plantation Society has sent reports to its members which it has received from Witu and Lewa. From Mr. Müller's reports on Lewa we learn that he emphasizes that the Negroes are not to be counted on because of their unreliability.
As far as the latter is concerned, one does not have to be so scrupulous or Sumatra in e vie in which is quite new. If the tobacco is good, this makes it much easier, and with an assortment that is not quite exactly à la Si, one will achieve quite satisfactory prices in the beginning.*) I am confident that in time the necessary people on the mainland will also become accustomed to plantation operations. It is advisable not to set up the enterprises too large at the beginning, but to take into account the quality and quantity of labor and the whole foreign situation. When recruiting and acclimatizing workers, much depends on the person in charge of such an enterprise. If he speaks and understands the language, knows the peculiarities of the people and spares their prejudices, they will get used to him and his guler Ru will go through the country. Such leaders will find workers who will also be reasonably stationary, and when they leave the work, which often happens, others will always stay behind and new ones will join their ranks. One must try to interest the village elders in such undertakings by giving them gifts, or by giving them or other respected elders supervisor posts, in the exercise of which they have little to do and relatively much to earn. In this way one also attracts the people; for one must not forget that an old, dirty Regerjumbe has more influence over his people than the greatest European "Bwava mkubwa" ("Great Lord"). You have to make successful shauris with the people, and that involves sacrificing some of your European individuality and descending more to the Reger. Of course, this is difficult for Europeans at first, but experience and above all the sun teaches almost everyone this over time. Such a plantation need not be a place that is shunned by the majority of the surrounding population and only visited by a few for daily purchases. One should try to make it the center of a certain amount of commercial traffic by opening a market or store. Naturally, such people from Zanzibar would demand and receive more pay than the natives. That would be a difficulty, but it cannot prevent such an attempt. These people must be settled together on the plantation; of course, each must have his wife. Natives will join this settlement all the more quickly as they can also satisfy their purchasing needs there. The greater consumption of the foreigners will also increase their modest consumption. In this way one begins to overcome needlessness, the enemy of all work. Of course, the first condition is that the people are not afraid to live under the eyes of the Europeans. Just at first, until the people have acquired a taste for work and merit, they will often have to let things be straight and accept the greatest stupidities and laziness with relative calm. Since the foreign Negroes will mostly be at work on the plantation, they will have little opportunity to grow crops themselves. This means that the people living nearby will be able to grow their produce. Such a settlement with market traffic will mainly have to be attempted where the people are very shy and reserved. If you settle in the middle of a densely populated tribe and the people quickly become accustomed to the Europeans, you will want to get on with them alone. When settling, the number of heads and the character of the surrounding tribe must be considered just as important as the quality of the land and the location for transportation. A great drawback of German East Africa is the lack of good "I do not doubt," he writes, "that the Negro will later be able to do the work just as well as the Javanese and Chinese, he certainly does not lack the physical strength, but he must first be trained, he must first have more needs that are now completely unknown to him. But this is still a question of time. But what are we planters to do in the meantime? At the moment the need for workers is not so great; we can console ourselves if tomorrow there are only 40 workers instead of 300, because the work does not yet have to be carried out so punctually and precisely. But let's think about the time when the tobacco is ripening in the fields and it comes down to one day, or whole fields are lost, what should we do if instead of 300 only 40 workers come?" - He emphasizes the necessity of having East Asian workers come; Chinese or Javanese are absolutely necessary for sorting the tadak, as the Reger are, so to speak, colour-blind. D. R. We take the opportunity here to make special reference to de Haarsma's "Der Tabakban in Deli", which was mentioned in the previous issue, as it describes the culture of tobacco in an exhaustive and equally clear manner. It is also very well illustrated and is highly recommended reading for anyone interested in tobacco growing.

 Draught cattle. Tobacco cultivation involves moving to new land every year. The cost of clearing the tree roots would hardly be in proportion to the savings made by using the plow instead of the hoe. So let's leave tobacco to the hoe for now. Cotton land, for example, as well as land for indigo, vanilla, coffee and cocoa plantations will have to be plowed and the crops will later have to be kept clean with the hoe. This is a great saving in labor. You become independent of the workers for many tasks. However, this requires reasonably strong draft cattle that do not constantly die under the planter's hands. If the indigenous cattle are too weak or not available, try to import them. Indian oxen from Bombay are excellent draught animals, but they are very expensive to transport, and as they often die on the mainland, the risk is great. This leaves only Madagascar and Somali cattle to choose from. Both are much cheaper to buy and transport than Indian cattle. Experience has shown that both breeds are domesticated on the island of Zanzibar; both working animals that have been in the plow and cart for a longer period of time and in which one could assume a kind of acclimatization, as well as newly imported cattle for slaughter. I do not know how these cattle (Madagascar and Somali) will prove themselves in German East Africa, or whether they have already been tried. In any case, experiments should be made and one must bear in mind that an animal, if it has not been very expensive to buy, will pay for itself in a very short time. As far as the question of craftsmen is concerned, it is well known that the Negroes are all bad craftsmen. The Chinese are good craftsmen, and Chinese carpenters, some of whom are employed on the British India Steamers, will be of use to every station and plantation. Goanese are also good carpenters, even if, in my experience, they suffer a lot from fever attacks. Hindus can be utilized very well as blacksmiths, locksmiths, plumbers, etc., just as the art of blacksmithing is known to flourish in India. In general, it seems to me that the useful people of the Hindus are sometimes too discredited by the Germans. Hopefully, German East Africa will soon move from the stage of theoretical discussions to that of practical colonization on a larger scale and plantation experiments with various tropical products through greater involvement of capital and enterprise. May these proposals, too, in their own way, help to shape the Reger into workers who will allow us to refrain from importing foreign labor. John Booth Jr. description of the Küsle between Mossamedes and Port Nolloth. (Conclusion.) On a low sandy coast at a distance of 27 nautical miles from Pelican Point, in 23° 20' s. Br. Br. on the tip of Ilheo, the outermost point of the narrow sandy headland that forms Sandwich Harbor or Port d'Ilheo. The harbor, which is an average of one nautical mile wide, is only open to the north and therefore completely protected from the prevailing south-westerly swell of the ocean. The anchorage is quite difficult, as over the years the tip of d'Ilheo has approached the mainland in a sharp bend and the entrance can only be recognized at a short distance. According to the reports of Corvette Captain Hoffmann, the coast here consists of astonishingly steep, dark yellow sand dunes about 150 meters high. The accumulation of drifting sand has reached extraordinary dimensions. In February 1889, Corvette Captain Rittmeyer visited the harbour with the cruiser "Habicht"; he reported that the harbour was located at the southern end of a higher mountain range and that a clearly recognizable row of rocks lay north of the entrance off the coast. Around this time, the entrance had already narrowed to 2 to 3 cable lengths. In the same year, Lieutenant-Captain Zeye anchored in the harbor with the gunboat "Hyäne" and found that a narrow foreland remained within the harbor between the ridge and the water, on which quartz could still be found here and there. He also reported constant sandfalls from the 150-meter-high dunes bordering the eastern side. This year (1890) there have been such heavy sandfalls from the dunes that the entrance to the harbor has become completely unsuitable for larger ships and even for boats in northerly winds. A bar has formed in front of the entrance, on which the surf is high in northerly winds. The harbor, which was the best anchorage on the entire coast due to its location and the fact that it offers fresh drinking water all year round, has now become completely unusable. A peculiar phenomenon is that both the sea and the moving dunes from the land side have worked to destroy it. The extent to which this has happened becomes quite clear when one considers the changes that have taken place at the entrance in a relatively short time. The entrance, which was still about 1400 meters wide in 1880, had already shrunk to 850 meters in 188 and is currently no more than 120 meters wide. However, after the closer examination carried out last year by H.M. gunboat "Hyäne", there is hope that a new entrance, or perhaps even a new harbor, will form. About 84 nautical miles south of the tip of the peninsula, a cut has formed in the headland, so that the latter is now only 150 meters wide. Four meters from land, 4 meters of water were found in this cut and the depths gradually increased towards the east. About 500 meters further south of this point, where the headland is somewhat lower and only 120 meters wide, the flood washes over the peninsula at high tide. A little further to the south, a new headland extending northwards from the peninsula is in the process of being formed, and with it a new harbor. The first thing to mention from Sandwich Harbour to the south is Conception Bay. It forms a wide open bay that offers no protection whatsoever, the center of which lies at 24° S. Br., and at a distance of 77 nautical miles from the tip of D'Ilheo we come upon a small rocky island, Hollams=Vogelinsel, a single rocky island 5½ nautical miles from the mainland, about 13 meters high; its circumference is about 1400 meters. It was surveyed in 1880 by the English survey steamer "Sylvia" and its position at 21° 37" 30" s. latitude and 14° 32' east of latitude. A reef extends from this rocky island in a south-westerly direction for about 5 nautical miles. A large number of whales play around dos Risf in July and August, and the island is inhabited by seals and penguins. It can only be approached with the greatest caution; it is visited at the time of the Guanolese, from April to August. The passage between the island and the mainland has a water depth of between 10 and 20 fathoms near the coast and is without danger except for a reef not far from the island. The coast at Hollams Vogelinsel is sandy. On the journey south, the coast shows sandy hills, from which rocks protrude in some places, the foothills of which protrude as dangerous cracks up to 3 nautical miles into the sea in some places. A larger indentation is formed by Spencerbai, 143 nautical miles from the tip of D'Jlheo, in the middle of which is the rocky island of Mercury, 40 meters high and 450 meters long in the northwest. The south-western tip of the bai is a 200-meter high rocky hill, the Dolphin Hill, which rises almost steeply out of the sea. The northern tip of the bay is bordered by a high sand dune. Mercury Island, which is located on the north side, at 25° 42° 38" s. Br. and 147* 51° 18" E. B. a 16 meter high rock rises steeply into the sea, is surrounded on the south side by cracks about 2 cable lengths wide. It has been observed that when the tide breaks on this rocky island in heavy seas, it shoots up the washed-out caves to a height of 30 meters. Many whales stay in the bay in the months of July and August, and Mercury Island is also visited during the guanolese season. The annual yield of guano is 350 to 400 tons; the main water birds are water ravens and pinnipeds. In 1880, when the English steamer "Sylvig" visited the bay, many cattle were seen in the interior of the country, numerous sheep, deer, bucks, wolves, gray foxes, elephants and ostriches. There were many salt springs in the main cuts, which would enable salt to be produced in large quantities. From the Spencerbai southwards, the coast retains its former character: in places, rocks and cracks emerge from the sand hills to the sea. The next anchorage is found in Hottentotbai. The bay is about 2 nautical miles wide and offers good anchorage. The repeatedly mentioned English steamer "Sylvia anchored in 1880 in 26° ** s. Br. and 14° 57" ö v. 6 in N. 57° W. about 1 nautical mile from Hottentot Point. The headland protecting the bay is partly rocky and reefy, while the beach of the peninsula is low and sandy. Natives occasionally come to fish and probably offer ostrich feathers in exchange for tobacco. They carry brackish water in bowls made of ostrich eggs, which they must have fetched far to the north, as their gestures suggest. They are armed with bows and arrows. To the south of the peninsula, about 1½ nautical miles away, there is a small rocky island where numerous birds can be found during the breeding season.

Page 297

The coast to the south of Hottentotbai is more rocky, with sandy beaches in places. It retains this character up to Ichaboe Island, which is about 10 meters high and is said to consist of granite, sandstone, slate and quartz. Its circumference is about 1400 meters and its distance from the coast is about 1200 meters. In the years 1843 to 1845 no less than 200,000 tons of guano were taken from this island. This yield is indicative of the business zeal of the English, who know how to exploit all advantages with such great prudence. Peruvian guano was imported to England for the first time in 1839/40. The importing company had great difficulty in winning over the farmers to the cause, but when greater attention was paid to the value of the fertilizer, a Liverpool house very soon equipped its own ships to visit the southwest African coast, whose wealth of guano had been reported in detail by the aforementioned American whale-watcher Morrell. In 1843, the first ships from Liverpool and Glasgow arrived on the west coast; their number grew rapidly and by the end of the same year amounted to nineteen, all of which were able to take on cargo at the same time. In the following year, the number of ships present was already considerably larger, as a result of which very frequent disputes arose among the shipmasters, especially over mooring and loading. An attempt was made to maintain order by an elected board of arbitrators, but in May 1844 they were forced to call in a warship, which took measures to ensure order. Around this time, 45 ships were united at the island of Jchaboe, which was the target of sailors due to its wealth of guano, which far exceeded that of the other islands. In July and August of the same year, this number grew to 300, which now had to sail to and load their cargo in a regulated manner according to a specific loading order. In September, the number of ships anchored at Ichaboe amounted to 200, and as disputes arose time and again, a warship was stationed at Ichaboe from then on. How necessary this was for the maintenance of order can be seen from the fact that in October (1844) the number of sailors and workers on Jchaboe was no less than 6000 men, all of whom were more or less addicted to drink. The outflow of guano was very considerable; in September 1844 about 90000 tons were loaded and shipped; in October to February (1845) 110000 tons. In January of the latter year, 450 ships were present. In August 1845, all the islands had been cleared of the stores piled up from the old days, and the coasts, for some time the coveted destination of English adventurers and sailors, were once again becoming desolate, after the plunder, as it can hardly be called otherwise, had been carried out on the land, which benefited nothing from the rich yields. It will not be uninteresting to calculate what quantities of guano have been removed in the few years and how great the benefits are. The figures we give are taken from the registers kept by the above-mentioned panel of arbitrators; they fall well short of the actual quantities. A small instep in Sandwichhafen yielded a few tons; on Hollams=Vogelinsel a few hundred tons were found; on Mercuryinsel about 1500 tons; on Ichaboe, the island whose description we are at, 200000 tons; in Angra Pequena on Pinguin= and Seehundsinsel about 3000 tons; on a narrow island south of Pedestal Point 8000 tons; on some small reefs between Pedestal Point and Possession Island a few tons were found; Possession Island yielded 4-50000 tons; on Albatross Rock, south of Possession Island, a small quantity was found; on Plum Pudding Island about 40 000 tons. These are the quantities taken from the islands north of the mouth of the Orange River, i.e. from the vat of our colony in the whole district. 257,330 tons. The coast south of the mouth of the Orange River supplied a total of 72700 tons, which we will not list in detail. The importers obtained 6 Lstr. 10 shillings to 7 Lstr. 10 shillings worth of good guano; the very poorest guano, mixed with sand, was not sold by the importers for less than 8 Lstr. per ton. The expenses on Ischaboe amounted to between 5 and 15 shillings per ton, and the English shipowners charged 4 liters per ton for freight. On average, the importers made at least 140 marks on each ton. Accordingly, in 1843/45, the English guano drivers made a net profit of no less than 36,026,200 marks on the guano shipped from the coast of our colony, without even a shilling of it benefiting the country itself. The English then proceeded to collect the newly accumulated guano from the said islands every year, which, as is well known, has become the reason why these islands on our coast have been handed over to them, while it is more in the interests of justice to hold them responsible for the decades-long robbery of the country. The islands that have been handed over to the English on our coast are called, from north to south: Hollams Island, Mercury Island, Ichaboe Island, Penguin Island, Seal Island, Halifax Island, Possession Island, Pomona Island, Plum Pudding Island and Roast Beef Island. For the sake of completeness, it should be noted that on the west coast of Africa only the southern zone has guano sites. Although the cold ocean current, which the waterfowl follow, extends up to Mossamedes, where it is lost to the northwest in the ocean, the waterfowl north of Walsischbai are only present in small numbers, so that the guano cannot accumulate to a sufficient extent.*) Apart from southwest Africa, the coast of Pern. the west coast of South America and the west coast of Australia still have guano sites, as they are all at the same latitude and therefore under the same climatological conditions. Ichaboe Island, the southern side of which is surrounded by dangerous cracks, can only be approached in clear weather, and you anchor near the island at the tip of the wreck. Another nearby anchorage is in Douglasbai, a good nautical mile to the south-east, which is protected by a protruding rocky point. It is only possible to land on the island at the north-eastern tip. According to measurements taken by the English steamer "Sylvia" in 1880, the northernmost point of the island lies at 26° 17° s. Br. Br. and at 14° 57° 25" E. B. G. There is a small Hottentot village on the beach of Douglasbai. The natives have to fetch their water about 14 kilometers away, while the Europeans bring their drinking water from the Cape. The Guano islands of Ichaboe, Plumpudding, Pomona, Poffession, Halifax and Mercury are visited every year. The small Guano reefs also include Stapleklippe, about 7 nautical miles from Jchaboe, which lies 1400 meters off the coast. Stapleklippe is adjoined to the northwest by Stapleriff, which consists of sandbanks with deep water in between. The consistently rocky coast continues to our better known harbor Angra=Pequena, now called "Lüderitz Bay". Its westernmost point lies about 23 nautical miles to the south of Jchaboeiniel in 26° 37° 50" s. It is known as Diazspitze, on which a white marble cross was erected by the famous Portuguese navigator Bartholomew Diaz in 1487. The remains of the cross are kept in the Cape Town Museum. Lüderitz erected a large black wooden cross on the same spot in 1884. About 3 nautical miles east of the Diazspitze is the Angraspitze, between the two lies the 1½ nautical miles wide Shearwaterbai, which offers good anchorage in 6 to 7 fathoms depth and protection against all winds with the exception of north and northwest winds. About 600 meters from Angras Point, the Angra Cliff rises out of the water, with a depth of 4½ fathoms between the two. To the east of Angras Point, between it and Shark Island, is the 1½ nautical mile wide entrance to AngraPequena proper. Shark Island. (Shark Island) is the southernmost of three islands that lie off the bay and protect it in almost all directions, even against the constant swell outside it, so that the water in the harbor is calm and smooth and landing on the sandy areas is easy and comfortable. To the north of Shark Island, about 1½ nautical miles away, lies Penguin Island. It is long, low and sandy and extends in a northerly direction To the north of Penguin Island, ½ nautical mile away, lies Seal Island, which is 1 nautical mile long and higher than Penguin Island. The fairway between the two islands is only ½ nautical mile with a depth of 5 to 7 fathoms due to protruding small headlands. Between Penguin and Shark Island and the mainland, protruding reefs form a very sheltered inland harbor half a nautical mile wide, known as Robert Harbor. It can be entered from the north and south of Penguin*) The reports of Captain Mensum, who carefully searched the coast from Walsischhai to Mossamedes at the time of the Guanolese (1843/45), are very readable and instructive; some of them are included in Underson's "The Okavango Current.

 However, the latter entrance between Penguin Island and Shark Island, which is free of all danger, is preferable to the northern entrance, as the latter is made unsafe by Tiger Rock. The latter lies on the north-eastern side of Penguin Island, is surrounded by deep water, but disappears below the surface at high tide. In order to lose its dangerousness, it would have to be marked by a beacon At Angra=Pequena=Bay lies the well-known factory of Mr. Lüderitz, now owned by the German Colonial Company for Southwest Africa, at a good landing place, a little north of the inlet called RobertHafen. There are several native kraals in the vicinity of the settlement. The climate is good; the temperature change is slight. The heat is only a minor nuisance, as a fresh southwest to south wind blows almost constantly, which has a cooling effect coming from the sea. The highest temperature observed here by the Germans was 42.5° C. The water only has a temperature of 17.5° C due to the cool northern coastal current. A great inconvenience is the sand dust that is blown up by the wind and penetrates through all the seams. Furthermore, there is no water on the beach; it is brought in barrels from Cape Town. The German Colonial Society for South West Africa owns so-called condensation apparatus in Lüderitz Bay, through which drinking water is prepared from the sea water by means of evaporation. The land is absolutely bare all around, only here and there small bushes grow between the stones and in the sand in the ravines of the mountains due to the frequent fog. The bays of the harbor contain a myriad of fish. Animals do not come as far as the coast. The islands, as their names suggest, were inhabited only by seals and penguins, but now there are a few huts on them for the workers who collect the guano. Various species of seabirds also nest there in large numbers. A belt of quicksand and drifting sand stretches around the harbor at a distance of 4-10 English miles, which understandably makes communication with the interior very difficult. The draught animals remain without water for 4 to 5 days on these journeys, which for the most part they can tolerate without harm. Minerals have been found in the vicinity of Angra Pequena. In January 1884, members of the crew of the gunboat "Nautilus" found metallic iron blasted into the rock mass of the mountains, and these pieces of iron could be collected in pockets. Lüderitz has given the name "Rantilushügel" (Rantilus Hill) to an approximately 150-metre-high mountain near the factory and erected a high black cross on it, as on the Diazspitze, which serves as a good landmark. About 1 nautical mile to the west of Angra Pequena lies Guanobai, which is bordered to the west by Guano= or Halifar Island, about 1000 meters long and connected to a reef at its northern end. The island is separated from the mainland by a channel one and a half cable lengths wide, the water depth of which is only 8 meters. The Vai, which is open to southerly winds but protected from westerly winds, has good anchorage at a depth of 11 fathoms. There is a flagpole and a house on Halifax Island, which is inhabited by a few people during guanvlese (April-August). Vigdai is 4 nautical miles south of Halisax, 1½ nautical miles wide and ¾ nautical miles deep, with a sandy coast, is open on all sides and offers no protection. Three nautical miles south of Bigbai, in 26° 46" s. Br. we come upon Long= or Ludovic Island, a rocky island 3 kilometers long, which consists of three parts; the sea passes over it in two places. The better entrance to a small bay protected by the island is around the north of the island, as there are cracks in the way on the south side. The small bay has good anchorage and makes it possible to land on a sandy beach. This place is frequented at the time of the Guanolese. One nautical mile south of Ludovic Island is Atlas Bay, a small bay without shelter, separated from it by 3 kilometers of smooth, rocky coast, Adventure Bay with a sandy beach, but without shelter, as it is completely open to the west. From Adventurebai, the coast retains the same character as far as Elisabethspitze, 3 nautical miles away. This is low and rocky, with a dangerous reef. East of Elisabeth Point the beach is sandy. *) As the description of Guanobai is based on a photograph from 1884, the conditions may have changed considerably in the meantime.
The northernmost of the 5 ½ kilometer long and 30 meter high Possession Island, which borders Elisabeth Bay in the west, lies 3½ nautical miles away from the same. Its average width is around 1 kilometer. It forms a curve, the concave side of which faces the mainland. There is a landing place for boats at the southern end. At the northern end of the island is a rocky promontory with a ½ mile long reef to the north and an even longer one to the east. The navigable channel between Elisabethspitze and the island is about 1 ½ nautical miles. The "Africa Pilot" also lists various dangerous cliffs, all of which are located near the island. These and a small inlet on the coast form Elisabeth Bay, which is about 2 nautical miles wide and has a beach interspersed with rocks. On the south side you can land with boats in good weather. About 25 nautical miles south of the south-eastern side of Possession Island lies the small Bol Island, and one nautical mile further on in 27° 2' S. B. is Albatross Island, the largest of a number of small islets of volcanic origin. The space between the rock and the mainland is about 1000 meters and is a good anchorage. On the other hand, a dangerous two-score-mile-long reef stretches from the Albatross Rock in a south-westerly direction. About 3% nautical miles from Albatross Rock lies Plumpudding Island, which has a rounded shape. The coast between Albatross Island and Plumpudding Island is rocky. The Prince of Wales Bay between Bolin Island and the outcrop of the mainland offers good anchorage, where it is easy to land on a sloping beach. Copper was shipped from here at the end of the sixties.*) About 12 nautical miles to the north of Possession Island we come across Pomona Island, at the northern end of which there is good anchorage in 4 fathoms of water. There is a dangerous reef between this island and the Aldatross Rock ¾ nautical miles from the latter in a south-westerly direction. Great caution is required everywhere when sailing along the coast. From Pomona Island to the Orange River, where the coastline of German Southwest Africa reaches its end, we first have 53 nautical miles in a southerly direction to Roastbeef Island and from there 60 nautical miles in a southeasterly direction to the mouth of the aforementioned border river. This entire coastline is completely barren, without any trace of vegetation. The beach here is also dotted with numerous small islets and reefs, but at no point do they extend more than a nautical mile into the sea, so that navigation is safe at this distance. If we continue our coastal voyage from Pomona Island, we first encounter Arch Rock in 27° 18 s. Br., we first encounter the Arch Rock, whose elongated shape, washed out by the sea in an arc in the middle, has given it its name. At 27° 23° s. Br. lies Whalebai, which is formed by a bulge in the coast and is open on all sides. In the northern part, about 100 meters from the mainland, are two small islets on which some guano is found. You can anchor on the outside of these in good weather. On the south side of the bay is a good landing place, from where a path leads inland to a native village about 18 kilometers away, which is said to have a friendly environment, while the coast is a complete sandy desert, interrupted only by a single small rocky hill of volcanic formation. The Afrika Pilot (II, 1884, p. 236) reports about the aforementioned village that the natives often come to the beach to fish and look for ships to trade sheep, oxen and ostriches very cheaply. In 27° 47 s. Br. we come to Angras Juntas, described in more detail by Captain Morell. At this point of the coast he found an inlet 1 nautical mile deep and 1½ nautical miles wide, which offers good protection against southerly winds in 14 to 5 fathoms of water, and describes the place as particularly suitable for communication with the natives, whose nearest dwelling place is about 9 kilometers to the northeast of the bay. In 27° 58° s. pr. lies the already mentioned *) These statements by Afrika Pilol, who also quotes a very interesting description of the harbor and Possession Island by Captain Morrell, are based on investigations from the year 1850, so that changes in one respect or another may have occurred in the meantime. The name of the mine in question was "Sinelairs mine" after an English captain.

Roastbeef Island, which can be referred to as Guano Island. The anchorage between the island and the mainland is unsafe due to many invisible cracks and strong swells. The coast now takes a south-easterly direction and presents no remarkable features until the mouth of the Orange River at 28° 38° 30° S. B. and 16° 27° 30" E. B. The mouth of the river, which flows through almost the entire southern continent and is called "Gariep" in the language of the natives, is fronted by mighty sandbanks that lie on rocky ground. Landing here is not possible at any time of the year; the nearest landing point is at Cape Voltas, 5 nautical miles to the south. The land around the mouth of the river is low. About 16 kilometers inland there are isolated hills that continue to rise to the higher mountains that border the river. J. Anderson notes in his work "Okavango=River" that only the lower part of the river is navigable for small vehicles and at certain times of the year, while higher up, currents and waterfalls, many of them significant and grand, make travel impossible. We continue the description of the coast as far as Port Nolloth, from where the connection to the land of the Bondelswaarts via Ookiep will probably continue as long as a good and safe landing place on the German southwest African coast for the Oranje region has not been found. At a distance of about 3½ nautical miles from the Orange River, a large inlet forms the Alexanderbai, whose banks run almost parallel and which is only open to the west. It offers small vessels some protection against the south-westerly swell through a reef of low rocks at the southern end. The entrance is dangerous for larger vessels as the bay is virtually enclosed by reefs. The bay has no drinking water; it has to be fetched 8 kilometers away from the area of the Orange River or from the nearby Voltaskap, where it is dug in the sand on the beach. Cape Voltas lies in 28° 42" s. Br. and has the shape of a very steeply rising peak with outcrops towards the sea. A bay opens up a little to the north of it, which offers no sheltered anchorage due to its marshy bottom and the constant swell on the bay. As already mentioned, drinking water can be dug from the beach here and is said to be particularly tasty. A chain of fairly high hills stretches along the coast from Cape Voltas to the south, the peaks of which suggest that they were formed by volcanic activity. The nearest protruding point is Wreck Point, which lies 11 nautical miles from Cape Voltas at 28° 45° S. B. is Harrison Bay, whose entrance is to the northwest and which has no cracks. On the other hand, there are cracks in front of the bay at some distance, which prevent larger ships from entering. These cracks extend further south to Homewood Harbor at 28° 46° S. B., which also only allows larger boats to land. In 29° S. B. a small coastal river, the Holgat River, flows into the sea. From here to Port Nolloth (or Robben=Bai) there are many cracks at a short distance from the coast, and the harbor itself is formed by various rocky reefs and by Robben Island. One reef runs from the southern tip of the harbor (29° 15' 10" S. B. and 1co 52' 20" E. G.) and turns northward almost parallel to the coast at a distance of about 2½ cable lengths. Another reef starts from the northern tip of the harbor and approaches the southern reef at a distance of 1¾ chord. In the middle of this passage there is a rocky cliff 1 to 17 English feet under water, over which the sea surges violently in fresh winds. The anchorage for ships with a draft of 8 to 9 feet is on the inside of Seal Island, which is located on the inside of the southern reef. The nature of the lagoon offers little safety and explains why cargoes and ships are often lost on landing, while larger ships can only anchor outside the reefs and unload and load through so-called lighters. The site is very important, as it is from here that the well-known copper mines of Ookiey, 60 kilometers away, are connected by a tramway and large quantities of copper are shipped. On the beach opposite Robben Island is the small village of Nolloth, named after a well-known English ship commander (1854), with a customs house and a post office. In the 1930s, the place was visited by American Walsh sailors, to whom the first more precise knowledge of the entire coast is owed, just as Captain Morell's reports are still used today as the only source for many other places on the northern coastal route. In the meantime, the coastal configuration has undergone many changes, so that our navy has the conceivable task of correcting the often outdated survey work of the Americans and English. Dr. H. Bolemeyer. The experiences made in the field of tropical equipment in the last two years. By Eduard Scheidel. (Lecture at the men's evening of the Berlin department on November 17. About two years ago, we had the opportunity to report on the equipment of the German East African Protection Force, which had just been established, at a meeting of the Berlin branch of the German Colonial Society. In the meantime, a whole range of the most important experiences have been gathered, which, especially at the present time, when the Schutztruppe is about to be transformed into an imperial force, and on this occasion the experiences that have been gained since its establishment are to be practically utilized, inspire a comparison between the present and the former state of the relevant questions. Prior to the establishment of the Schutztruppe, which currently numbers around 200 German officers, civil servants and non-commissioned officers (the native crews are not even considered in the present questions), there were only a few Germans who devoted themselves to exploring our newly acquired colonies and serving in them. Initially, they were merely dependent on the advice that individual friends could give them from their experiences and were forced to laboriously buy the necessary equipment from a whole number of suppliers, whereby the people concerned, especially when they went out for the first time, lacked any in-depth knowledge and experience with regard to the requirements to be made of tropical equipment and it quite often depended on chance whether the person concerned was well or poorly equipped, in which latter case life and health were too easily put in serious danger. The German Officers' Association was quite lively in this field, as many of those traveling to the tropics, especially to our protectorates, belonged to it, whether as former active or reserve officers, so that the same, especially stimulated by the suddenly considerably increased need due to the establishment of the Schutztruppe, the Schutztruppe had to make it its business, in the interests of its members, to pay particular attention to this area and to gather experience wherever it could, in order to arrive at a model tropical armament. First and foremost, of course, the Officers' Association was interested in the experience gained by the officers of the Schutztruppe with the equipment supplied to them. - At the same time, however, the association also approached a number of experienced travelers to Africa with requests for an appraisal of the equipment it had produced and for advice on how to improve it. In this way, extensive material was gathered over time, which formed the basis for detailed discussions on the future design of an appropriate tropical armament, which were held partly in Lauterberg and partly in Berlin during the presence of Reichskommissar Major von Wißmann in Germany, which may be of all the more interest to the readers of this paper, as the Officers' Association has declared itself willing to make its experiences accessible to non-members and to support them with its expert advice where this is desired. When deciding on the individual pieces of equipment to be considered and their abundance, a number of factors must be taken into account which are decisive for the individual case; these include first and foremost the destination and purpose of the journey, in particular the question of whether it is a stationary stay on the coast where any replacement that may become necessary can be procured with relatively little effort, or whether it is an expedition deep into the hinterland of the protected areas, for which such subsequent completion of the equipment is initially still ruled out. Then the means available in the given case play an essential role, which is why particular care must be taken to keep the cost of the equipment as low as possible while maintaining the very best quality in every respect, while on the other hand the physical constitution of the traveler, his hobbies and the greater or lesser value he places on the care of the equipment must be taken into account.

Page 300

 for its comfort are important factors. It has been possible to reduce the cost of the initial equipment, e.g. for the oifiziers of the Schutztruppe, which initially only concerns the needs at the stations, as the equipment for expeditions into the interior is supplied by the Reichökommissariat, to about half of what was generally considered necessary about two years ago. - A not insignificant factor here is that certain items, such as j. For example, the large numbers of white cotton suits that are always needed are considerably cheaper in Zanzibar than would have been possible in Germany due to the significantly higher wages, which is why it was possible to limit the purchases of such items to what was necessary for the journey and the initial stay. Turning to the individual items of equipment, the tropical tent deserves to be mentioned first and foremost as one of the most important. The tent, as it has now been finally introduced by the Reichskommissariat, is essentially based on English models, just as the English, with their centuries of experience, must still serve as models for us in all questions of equipment, as in many other colonial matters. The initial requirements for a usable tropical tent are: Protection against the tropical sun and rain, excellent ventilation, the simplest possible construction, resistance to all weather conditions and the lowest possible weight. The fulfillment of the first condition is essentially achieved by giving the tent a double roof, of which the upper one is about one foot away from the one below. Sun and rain are initially absorbed by the upper roof; the layer of air circulating continuously between the two roofs prevents excessive heating of the air inside the tent and rain penetration is prevented even in the heaviest tropical rain. Ventilation is achieved by air flaps on the ridge of the lower tent roof; the aforementioned air flow between the two roofs constantly takes away the spoiled air, which is always rising upwards because it is warm. The construction allows the tent to be erected on any ground within a few minutes by only moderately experienced natives. The resistance to all weather influences is achieved by impregnating the tent fabric against rotting using a unique method and the weight has been reduced to 1½ girder loads, i.e. approx. 90 pounds, without prejudice to the durability, of which a further 10 pounds can be saved if the tent frames made of Mannesmann tubes, which have recently been tested, prove their worth. The size of the tent is such that it is sufficient for a traveler not only as sleeping space but also as living space and can accommodate his bed, table, chair, bathtub and a suitcase. The question of the most practical bed has been settled by the final acceptance of a German model, namely the one previously tested by Captain Kundsch, after all the English models procured for comparison had been rejected. The mosquito net is no longer mounted on a frame attached to the bed itself, but on the inner walls of the tent to which it has been adapted in the forin. The construction of a completely new model turned out to be necessary to achieve a usable table. All designs in which the legs were attached to the table top so that they could be folded down had to be discarded because they were not fixed and therefore not suitable for writing. We also had to abandon the English method of using table tops that can be rolled up like blinds, as this does not provide a sufficient guarantee of durability and rules out repairs during the journey. Another significant improvement to the table is that it has been given a shape in which it forms an elongated, narrow load tied together with a suitcase, which is the way the Reger prefers to carry it. The need for physical comfort plays a special role in the chair. If this is dispensed with, a simple canvas chair will suffice, of which there are now about 4 usable models. - However, when traveling in the tropics, where one has to do without so many other things that have become a necessity through education and habit, it is not without reason that one often attaches importance to being able to rest on a comfortable seat after a strenuous march, so in many cases, in addition to the simple tent chair, a foldable reclining chair is carried along for which the Triumph chairs, which have been in use for some years, have given the basic idea. The suitcases have proved their worth in their initial construction, as they meet all the requirements placed on them, i.e. they are durable and relatively lightweight, and are airtight, waterproof and antproof. The improvements made to the suitcases could therefore be limited to making them even more suitable for their specific purpose by means of internal fittings. To hold what every traveler must always have at hand, a case with four inserts was first constructed, which are intended to hold the pharmacy, writing materials and diaries, cigars and smoking utensils and a hand supply of cartridges. - In addition to this case, it was necessary to have a case designed to hold the most essential items of clothing, underwear, shoes and toiletries. This was given the shape of a modestly sized bathtub so that it could also be used as such, which meant that the collapsible rubber bathtub that had been commonly used since then could be dispensed with as a separate piece of equipment. To hold the above-mentioned contents, this bathtub was fitted with a basket insert divided into two parts by a partition. - A further case is designed to hold all the cooking utensils, possibly sufficient for 6 people, while a basket was chosen for the eating utensils, which is not dissimilar to the usual serving baskets. The important thing about it is that it contains two absolutely airtight boxes made of nickel plate, in which finished roasts, bread, etc. can be stored for days and kept fresh. Furthermore, especially for larger expeditions, a lamp case has been constructed which, in addition to a petroleum lamp that can be taken apart when full, contains 2 lanterns, 6 containers for different types of fuel oil, lights, matches, wicks, spare cylinders and cleaning cloths. Depending on the size of the expedition, this is followed by a larger or smaller number of empty suitcases to hold the spare items of clothing and other necessities. First and foremost, a number of attempts have been made to produce a tropical helmet that meets all requirements, although these have not yet been fully completed. The most recent attempts have been to give the inside of the helmet a sponge-like coating which, when moistened, should provide increased protection against the effects of the tropical sun. Furthermore, the helmet has received a not insignificant innovation, a burnt, waterproof cover, which is not only to be worn in the rainy season, but also on expeditions directed against the enemy and in battle, for reasons to be discussed in more detail below. Some of the suits have already undergone significant changes, while others are still to come, particularly with regard to the so-called Gala suit worn by the Schutztruppe. With the transformation of the Schutztruppe into an imperial force, the latter is to be changed into a parade uniform, which can also be worn as a national uniform in Germany. The designs have been submitted to the Colonial Department of the Foreign Office in order to obtain the approval of His Majesty the Emperor through their mediation. Of the suits specially designed for use in the tropics, those made of white flannel soon became completely unusable due to the peculiar treatment of the linen by the Reger, which would terrify any German housewife. The white suits, the typical costume of every European in the tropics, on the other hand, could hardly ever be replaced by anything better. In recent times, particular attention has been paid to suits made from a light brown cotton fabric, such as that used for the uniforms of the British Indian army. These suits have the advantage that in them the European does not offer the enemy native such a clear target, recognizable from afar, as was the case with the white suits. For this reason, the brown cover is also worn with the white tropical helmet in some cases. The protective clothing has undergone a change insofar as the high shaft boots have been almost completely discontinued, as experience has shown that when one has to march through swamps, where they are mainly intended to provide protection, the swamp is usually so deep that the water penetrates from above, leaving the shaft with only one task to fulfill, namely to protect the lower legs against the sharp steppe grasses, which is more easily and comfortably achieved with gaiters. The steppe grasses are also the reason why the hook lacing for gaiters and shoes, which is so popular in Germany for hunting purposes, has been completely abandoned, as the grasses get caught in the hooks and make walking very difficult. The question of undergarments is still as unresolved today as it was years ago, and it almost seems as if the same is true in

Page 301

could not be decided in the foreseeable future, in the sense that one type of undergarment could be described as the only correct one and all others as inappropriate. Personal habits and the more or less sensitive skin play an important role here. - On the one hand, it can be said that hunter's wool has lost much of its reputation, firstly because its treatment in the laundry causes not insignificant difficulties, but also because it is likely to irritate very sensitive skin and thus cause the much feared "note dog". Shirts made of a very thin tricot-like cotton fabric, called singlets by the English, are now often preferred. Shirts made of Chinese raw silk still have their warm defenders, but they are quite expensive to buy. Flannel pyjamas, which were strongly recommended from the beginning, were later thought to be dispensable, but they have been unconditionally returned to, especially for the prevention of the annual colds of the abdomen due to the extremely rapid increase in sensitivity to even insignificant temperature fluctuations in the tropics. Of the smaller items of equipment, the field flap should be mentioned first and foremost, because its construction caused considerable difficulties in meeting all the demands placed on it. In order to keep the contents of the canteen as cool as possible, one was introduced which, made of metal, was covered with a very thick felt lining. The idea behind this design was to keep the felt cover moist by frequently dipping it in water. The water, which evaporated quickly in the tropical heat, removed the heat from the bottle itself and its contents and kept the latter cool, provided that water or a puddle was available to carry out the tedious manipulation, which was not always the case. In addition, the bottle had to be designed to hold two liters instead of one, which made it impossible for the European to carry it himself. The bottle therefore had to be handed over to a carrier, who could not be expected to carry out the manipulation just described conscientiously. A substitute is now believed to have been found in a large glass bottle of the type used by our hospital orderlies. These are provided with a cowhide cover prepared according to a special method, which is a particularly poor heat conductor. - In order to prevent the danger of the person carrying the bottle emptying it himself, it had to be fitted with a lock. Since it is not always possible to unlock the canteen before taking a sip, it is necessary to carry a second small canteen for the respective needs in a pocket of the European's coat. At the moment, tests are being carried out with this new canteen, the results of which are still pending. However, the above-mentioned items of equipment do not exhaust the personal equipment of a traveler; it also includes a number of small items which, however, are of too little general interest to be mentioned here. In order not to exceed the space available for this discussion, it was also necessary to refrain from dealing with some other questions closely related to the equipment of an expedition, even though they are also important enough to stimulate a detailed study. We are referring here primarily to the questions of armament, the number and selection of the articles of clothing required in lieu of money and their various sources of supply, the provisioning and catering of the caravan, the scientific instruments, the signaling devices for stations and some smaller aids to increase the impression of the intellectual superiority of the European among the natives. It was also necessary to dispense with a discussion of the differences in the requirements for the West African colonies in contrast to the East African colonies, and in particular with a special consideration of the equipment for the Southwest African protectorate, for which the preconditions differed so completely from everything that is decisive for tropical regions. Nevertheless, the above lines should provide evidence that in this area, too, a lively activity is being developed in the interests of the colonial cause, which will in time lead to such perfection that we can emancipate ourselves completely from foreign models, including English ones, and stand entirely on our own two feet.
The contract between the Imperial Government and the German East African Society. The following agreement has been concluded between the Imperial Government on the one hand and the German East African Society with its seat in Berlin, represented by its Board of Directors, after approval by the General Meeting of the Society's members on the other hand, in which the term "Society" is always understood to mean the "German East African Society" The Imperial Government intends to conclude a state treaty, by which the sovereign rights over the coastal area off the German sphere of jurisdiction in East Africa, together with its appurtenances and the island of Masia, are to be ceded to His Majesty the German Emperor in return for compensation from His Highness the Sultan of Tanzibar. The present agreement shall enter into force only on the condition that the contract contemplated is concluded on December 1, 1890, at the latest, and that in this contract the transfer of sovereign rights on the part of the Sultan of Zanzibar is fixed for no later date than January 1, 1891. §For the purpose of paying the compensation to be granted to the Sullan of Sausivar for the transfer of his sovereign rights, the Company undertakes to make available and pay to the Imperial Government the sum of four (4) million marks of German imperial currency in gold by December 28, 1890, at the latest. The Imperial Government will ensure that, for the purpose of raising the funds for this payment and for the other purposes specified in § 3 of this agreement, the Company obtains in good time the state authorization required under the Prussian Act of 17 June 1833 (Ges.=Samml. 1833 p. 75) to take up a bond with an annual interest rate of 5 percent and a semi-annual interest rate of 0.3257 percent of its nominal amount plus the nominal amounts to be amortized from the saved interest kilg, repayable at a rate of 105%, in bonds issued to each bearer and the approval of its supervisory authority required under § 37. Zisser 4. and § 42. Zisser 3. of the company's articles of association. §3. in order to raise the funds for the payment to be made to the Imperial Government in accordance with § 2 and for use for permanent economic investments in the German East African territory and for the promotion of traffic to the same, the Company undertakes to the Imperial Government to issue a loan in the total amount of 10556000 Marks. The company is obliged to use the proceeds of the loan, insofar as they exceed the payment to be made immediately as stipulated in § 2, to provide the buoyage of the ports in the coastal area in accordance with the plan drawn up by the Imperial Naval Office on May 27, 1890, as well as to provide lighting facilities in the maximum amount of 250,000 marks. This work will begin on April 1, 1891 at the latest. At the request of the imperial government, the proceeds of the annexes must not be used if this use does not fall within the purpose set out in paragraph 1. - The use must be made within the first 10 years, unless the Imperial Government allows an extension. j. 4. The contract concluded by the Company with His Highness the Sultan of Zanzibar on 28 April 1888 and modified by the supplementary agreement of 13 January 1890 shall cease to be in force from the date of payment of the compensation sum (§ 2), insofar as its provisions are not expressly upheld by the present contract. From that date the Imperial Government shall take over the administration of the coastal territory and its appurtenances, the island of Masia, and the Schupgebict. Accordingly, the Imperial Government shall be responsible for all customs duties received from the time of the assumption of administration, as well as any taxes and other public charges of any kind that may be levied §. 5. On the other hand, the Imperial Government undertakes, from January 1, 1891 until such time as the loan to be taken up by the Company (§§. 2 and 3) has been repaid in full as scheduled. 3) has been fully repaid as scheduled, the Imperial Government undertakes to pay the annual amount of six hundred thousand (600,000) marks to the office to be designated by the Company for the purpose of interest payment and amortization of the bond to be taken up from the gross customs revenue collected by the Imperial Government from imports and exports to and from the coastal territory without any deduction and without any set-off under any circumstances. Payment shall be made in semi-annual installments of 300,000 marks each on June 20 and December 20. Four weeks after the end of each monthly statement of customs receipts, the company shall be notified of the amount. 6. as long as the obligation of the Imperial Government to make the payment stipulated in § 5 exists, the Imperial Government shall not permit any changes in the customs duties in force on the coast at the time of the conclusion of the contract, insofar as such a change jeopardizes the collection of a customs revenue of at least 600,000 marks per annum. If the Imperial Government establishes customs offices outside the coastal area, the revenues of these customs offices shall also be used to raise the aforementioned 600,000 marks for the duration of the contract. If in one year or in a majority of years the amount of 600,000 marks required for the service of the Anleibe should not be provided by the gross proceeds of the customs duties, the difference shall be paid out of the

Page 302

 the amount of 600,000 marks in later years (§ 5l. The Imperial Government shall grant the Company the following powers as a further consideration 28. April 28, 1888 for the exercise of its rights under the contract of January 13, 1820. Notwithstanding the powers granted by the Company outside the coastal area, its appurtenances and the island of Masia (§. 1) and outside the territory for which the Imperial Charter has been granted, the Imperial Government assigns to the Company for the coastal area, its appurtenances, the island of Masia and the territory of the Charter the exclusive right to acquire ownership by seizing possession (right of occupation) of ownerless land and its immovable properties, including in particular the right of occupation of forests. However, with the reservation of a) the well-acquired rights of third parties to such ownerless properties: b) the right of the Imperial Government to acquire ownerless properties, insofar as such properties are required at its discretion for public buildings in the interest of the administration and the protection of the coastal and conservation area, by way of occupation for the Empire c) the right of the Imperial Government to issue laws and ordinances for the exploitation of the forests, also for society, in the interest of national and forestry culture. With regard to the extraction of minerals, the Company shall be granted the same advantages, in particular with regard to the granting of fields, for the coastal area, its appurtenances, the island of Masia and the area of the Imperial Charter, regardless of whether the Company itself or another party is the finder, as the finder is entitled to under the laws applicable in those areas. In addition, the Imperial Government undertakes to impose a levy of five 15) percent of the minerals extracted by the finder in favor of the Company on the person concerned if he is not the finder. J. In the concession of the construction and operation of railroads in the coastal area, its appurtenances, on the island of Masia and the territory of the Imperial Schupdrief, the Company shall have priority over other applicants if the concession is granted and the conditions set are fulfilled. The building and operating permit to be granted to the company in the event that it makes use of this privilege shall be transferable. 4. the company shall be granted the right to establish a bank with the privilege of issuing notes. h. The Company shall retain the right to mint and issue coins of copper and silver, which must be accepted in payment at the public treasuries of the coastal area, its appurtenances and the Jasel Masia, as well as the area of the Imperial Charter, Before enacting laws and ordinances for the coastal territory, its appurtenances, the island of Masia and the territory of the Imperial Charter, the Imperial Government shall call upon the Company for an expert opinion, unless the urgency of the case requires a deviation from the rule. §Insofar as it does not concern rights which the Company has acquired during the term of this agreement on the basis of the powers granted to it here (cf. § 7), the present agreement shall cease to apply as soon as the loan to be raised (§§ 3 and 3) has been repaid. Berlin, November 20, 1890 Correspondence. We are able to make the following very interesting announcements from Dr. Emin's private reports. Tabora, August 18, 1890: The more the German possessions in East Africa are regarded by many as a gift from Dana to the Reich, and the more one feels compelled to emphasize their worthlessness, the more it seems necessary to shed light on these possessions from the spot. If one judges countries as unworthy on the basis of fleeting travel through them, then longer familiarity with them and their people may make many things appear in a different light than one is usually inclined to assume. And to show that the writer is not interested in shedding rosy light on dark conditions, it may be admitted from the outset that our African possessions are hardly usable as landed property for Germans and only acquire their real value when one considers their hinterlands as production centers and their own position as trade intermediaries. Admitting this, there immediately arises the necessity of drawing into the circle of our interests all territories which have not been granted to others and of organizing the country in the shortest possible time in such a way that its expenses are covered by its own revenues. Only when this task has been accomplished satisfactorily can we think of a comprehensive approach to humanitarian issues. For however important the suppression of the slave trade may be, however important and useful the creation of schools and institutions of instruction may be, however urgent the construction of new and light railroads may be, no thought can be given to tackling them until one has become master of the country and a firm and secure foundation has been laid for the building to be erected. If everywhere in the world, the power of power is held in high esteem, this is doubly true of Africa, and many a bitter experience would have been spared our countrymen if, instead of following philanthropic intuitions and unfounded assumptions, they had first created a firm center in a practical way and from this slowly and steadily paved their way in all directions. And from this, in turn, it follows inevitably that our next task, now that the coast has returned to peace and quiet, is to create a firm base for the German night in the interior. For many reasons, Tabora recommended itself for this purpose. Situated in the middle of almost all the traffic routes that have been established so far, relatively easy and quick to reach from the coast, inhabited by people who, through long contact with civilization, have become receptive to its advantages, I do not say blessings, richly provided with everything necessary for life, heavily populated and able to provide any number of porters, the Ork offers everything one could wish for a main station. The successes of this expedition have proved that we can get along with the Arabs; it would be wrong to think of expelling them from Central Africa, because on the one hand the costs of such an action would be disproportionate to the profit that could be made from it, but on the other hand we would be depriving ourselves of a cultural element whose value, though doubtful, cannot be underestimated, and finally the question would arise as to what should replace the Arabs. Let us therefore take the existing circumstances into account. Appropriate treatment, a certain amount of consideration for religious and other prejudices, the promotion of legitimate trade and a strict love of justice are the simplest means of befriending the Arabs and gaining intermediate traders for German trade, who have been familiar with places and people for decades and are quite irreplaceable for the time being. The only objection that could be raised against this is the vexed question of slavery, and I may therefore be permitted to touch on this here. To speak now of the suppression of slavery in the interior of Afrila is a figure of speech, the realization of which is unfortunately still impossible for some time. The institution of slavery is so closely linked to the religious and tribal institution, and the keeping of slaves has become such a necessary condition for work and culture, that a clumsy and premature handling of this question would give rise to just as serious entanglements as those that have taken place under the guise of religious fanaticism in the Sudan. Our task for the moment is the ruthless suppression of the slave trade on a large scale, the prevention of raids to obtain slaves and the abolition of slave caravans. This includes the prevention and punishment of atrocities committed against slaves. There are two factors at our disposal to achieve this task: military power on the one hand and the skillful use and promotion of certain missionary institutions. Military power is sufficiently represented by the establishment of stations across the country. As far as the missions are concerned, I have in mind only those which, instead of teaching their pupils to read mechanical books and providing them with plaid pants at the expense of pious souls in Europe, teach them useful knowledge, instruct them in agriculture, teach them trades and thus make every missionary institution a focal point for humanitarian work. It is a pleasure for me to recall the Catholic mission in Bagamoyo and its subsidiary institutions. In any case, such institutions deserve every support from the state and it should be made the duty of all stations to support them as much as possible. On the other hand, it should be the duty of the missionaries to train good people who can make themselves useful in military service or as craftsmen by teaching them the necessary knowledge. If we now come to talk about an organization to be created, the following would be recommended: In addition to Tabora as a center, which would have to be manned by about 150 soldiers, three to four larger stations should be established, e.g. in Qua Metere, at Lake Tanganyika and at suitable locations further north. Each such station should be manned by 100 men under the command of a German officer and several sub-officers. The soldiers are to be sent from the coast at the beginning, but must gradually be replaced by soldiers from the north.

Page 303

The soldiers are recruited and replaced by soldiers recruited and trained in the country because they make fewer demands in terms of food and are satisfied with lower pay. The material for these soldiers are slaves who have been set free. After a thorough survey, a number of suitable points have been selected for the establishment of second-tier stations, points which are to be manned by 50-60 soldiers, placed under the supervision of a German non-commissioned officer and located at a suitable distance from the main station. The costs of setting up such stations would be easily covered by a tribute of ivory imposed on the village chief. In addition, the population is obliged to pay a contribution of grain to support the soldiers and to provide all necessary porters in return for payment. Caravans have to pay a certain tax and can receive escort teams for certain distances or cases. The natives are obliged to keep the footpaths open and in order. The import of powder and lead from the coast is absolutely forbidden, as is the import of water, but station chiefs are given a certain quantity of ammunition to hand out to trustworthy people in the country, taking into account the rifles now available, but must report to their superiors every time they are issued. The station chiefs are to induce the natives to send caravans directly to the coast and to give them every assistance in doing so. At the largest stations, experiments should be made with the acclimatization of domestic animals, such as camels, buffaloes, etc., and each soldier should also be required to cultivate a piece of land for himself and his dependants, and seeds should be supplied to them for this purpose in the first year. Care shall be taken as far as possible for the propagation of crops of all kinds among the population. A number of measures relating to management and operation could easily be developed. I mention, among other things, the establishment of Wanlamuesi, settlements within Ugogo, the construction and monitoring of water holes and wells, as well as the irrigation system in general, the regulation of caravans, trade and posts, the introduction of European retail trade with careful use of the Creeks or Indians on the coast, etc. The first condition for a prosperous development is and remains, as cannot be sufficiently emphasized, the definitive occupation and development of the sea areas. Only in this way would it be possible to cover the administrative costs. The natural drainage routes for the large lakes are directed towards Zanzibar, and since the route for Egypt has been closed for years, the products of the countries on the small lakes also belong here. I believe I can assume all the more that people and means would be found to exploit these areas rationally, as there is no other area in the whole of Africa that is more appealing to Europeans than the one that has been raided, and as its products would provide a rich return on all sums spent, both commercially and economically. The dispatch of steamers to the Seren would of course be of the greatest importance, not only as a facilitation of traffic, but as an open sign of the possessing power. However, if a rational administration of these territories is envisaged at all, a tripartite division is recommended, as their administration from the coast is already illusory due to the distance. The coastal area, including Kilimanjaro as far as Mywapwa, the northern maritime area with a main station in the north and Tabora as a transit point, and the southern area from Nyassa to Lindl and Mikindani. However, since the cost of all these projects necessarily remains the main issue, we are primarily concerned with covering the costs arising from all these proposals. It goes without saying that the Empire would have to provide funds for the start in order to establish stations, arm soldiers, procure guns and steamers and pay crews and officers. In a short time it would be possible to raise the country to such an extent that the stations could manage with little support and eventually become self-sustaining. Within three years it would be possible to pay all the costs incurred, if the matter is approached correctly. It was the writer's intention to point out what needs to be done; he would consider himself fortunate if he were allowed to show that what he has shown is also feasible. Of course, the first condition for his work would be discretionary power, separation of these parts of the country from the coastal area and permission for their own administration with appropriate dispersal on the coast. One million marks for the beginning and later half a million marks would be more than enough to cover the administrative costs until these areas are able to sustain themselves from their own sources of aid.
Catholic missionary activity in our colonies. When we presented the Protestant missionary activity in our colonies to our readers in a series of articles (Deutsche Kolonialzeitung 1888 No. 13, 17, 18, 29, 37, 39 by D. Gundemann), Catholic missionary activity was still insignificant in relation to Protestant activity, apart from the branches in East Africa. Recent times, however, have seen such great efforts on the part of Catholic missionary activity that it is appropriate to take a look at what has already been accomplished and what is planned for the future. An excellent compilation of the material is contained in the work of Baron Léon Bethune "Les Missions catholiques d'Afrique" (Société de Saint Augustin, Desclée, de Brouwer et Cie., Lille), which we take as a basis for our work. The mission on the east coast. Apostolic Vicariate of Zanzibar and Prefecture of South Zanzibar. When, at the end of the seventeenth century, the Portuguese were forced to abandon the places they had occupied north of Cape Delgado, the onslaught of Islam also swept away the Franciscan and Augustinian settlements, and the last traces of Christianity disappeared under the rule of the Iman of Muscat. In this century, the material development of the country began to improve considerably, but religious development lagged behind completely. Nothing was happening for the Catholics at a time when the English missions were already very active. This religious situation, which was detrimental to the Catholics, prompted Bishop Maupoint of St. Denis on Reunion to send three priests from his diocese to Zanzibar in 1860. Following their report, Bishop Maupoint handed over the mission of Zanzibar to the Congregation of the Holy Spirit in 1863. The Fathers of the Holy Spirit were very familiar with the conversion of black people, they already had missions in Guinea, in the French colonies, as well as in the south of America, but nevertheless they found themselves in a very difficult situation in Zanzibar, as the Iolam dominated everything. However, Father Horner, a German and former director of a leper hospital on Bourbon, succeeded in forming a certain nucleus for later activities by acquiring a number of slave children for whom a trade school was created. The pupils grew to such an extent that it was soon necessary to look for a base on the coast. Father Horner bought a large area of undeveloped land near Bagamoyo, cleared the land with the help of the pupils and built the institution on it, which still arouses the admiration of all travelers and whose flourishing recently gave rise to a controversy about the merits of the Catholic and Protestant missionary methods, which cannot be discussed in detail here. Next to the orphanages, one of which is run by priests and another by sisters, the huts of a village of natives and the homes of former missionary children soon rose up. A head appointed by the Father Superior watches over public affairs and exercises jurisdiction under his direction and supported by his authority. In 1869, this settlement already had 200 souls, which increased considerably due to the children freed from the slave ships by the English cruisers. The English consular officials even obtained an annual grant and other support for the missionaries, whose efforts they highly appreciated. Today there is a church and school, an orphanage with over 250 black children and a large hospital. Furthermore, the most diverse studies on climate were first carried out here, followed by significant planting of entire rows of colonial products from the hot zone with such success that this settlement is generally recognized as a model institution in material terms as well. It is known that during the war the mission, where some 7000 blacks had taken refuge, and the missionaries were not harassed by the enemy, and that Father Superior of Bagamoyo succeeded in obtaining the praise of the religious captured in Pugu. Their Samaritan activity during the war must also be fully recognized. However, the missionaries had already turned their attention to the interior of the country at the end of the sixties, but it was only from 1877 onwards that the Fathers turned their attention to it with determination and founded a number of Christian villages such as Mhonda in Useguba, 15 days' journey from the coast, and also in Mandera, a village halfway between Mhonda and Bagamoyo, as well as in Mrogoro. The current apostolic vicar, Mgr. de Courmont, appointed in 1883, had hardly set foot on African soil when he himself

Page 304

 planted the cross in Tununguo in Ukami and in Condoa, a former station of the French-African Society. Since then, new stations have been added: Lalonga, Sima, and in 1890 the bishop visited the Kilimanjaro Mountains and founded a new branch there. A summary of the experiences of these individual stations during the war years was recently published in the "Kölnische Volks-Zeitung" on the basis of letters and reports from the missionaries, from which we take the following. Mandera was involved in the war unrest to the extent that Bana Heri had set up camp not far to the east. In January 1890, the mission visited Baron von Gravenreuth, who had come with a hundred men to locate Bana Heri's hiding place, and issued a proclamation prohibiting feuds between the individual chiefs and the Heri system and confirming the missionaries as justices of the peace for the individual areas of dispute, unless they had to be heard in Bagamoyo. The population, which consists mainly of wados, who are still said to be cannibals, has since followed this instruction and it is said that they sometimes come in their hundreds at the same time. The mission in Mhonda has not suffered any damage during the war years; the number of Catholics there is 478. The church service is always very well attended. During the war, the missionaries repeatedly provided services to the German commanders to suppress the uprising. At the time of Bana Heri's invasion, for example, they sent couriers to Baron von Gravenreuth, who was in Mrogoro at the time looking for him, and informed him of his presence in Maera. Gravenreuth immediately appeared in Mhonda (December 14, 1889) and took 40 bales of cloth and 38 donkeys as booty from Bana Heri in Mtega. He also punished some rebellious chiefs in the area, so that now more than a hundred of these small chiefs, some of whom live 15-20 hours away from Mhonda, have already demanded letters of protection and thus given some guarantees for further good behavior. In addition, most of the natives now elect the Superior of the Mission as arbitrator and willingly accept his verdict. For this purpose, there is a kind of court made up of Christians and several chiefs. The mission of Longa consists of the Christian villages of St. Benedictus, Condoa (the last name by which this mission is generally known) and Mariahilf. For the time being, the situation is still not well organized, so that real success can only be expected once a kind of native protection or vigilance force has restored peace, as the hostile Wanjamwesi tribe is making constant incursions into this fertile region under the pretext of supporting the Germans. As Condoa is on the way to Mpwapwa, it is regularly visited by travelers. (To be continued.) News from the Society. - The Committee held a meeting in the Society's rooms on November 22 under the chairmanship of His Serene Highness the Prince of Hohenlohe=Langenburg. The discussions mainly concerned matters relating to the Society, in particular the adoption of the budget for 1891, which had been discussed by the Finance Committee. The agenda for the Board meeting scheduled for December 11 of this year is now as follows: 1. budget for 1891 (proposals Waldenburg, Cologne, Dresden). 2. work plan for 1891. 3. motions and letters. 4. business matters. The President also announced that, in view of the changed situation following the successes of the Reichskommissar, the Commission for Combating the Slave Trade had decided at a meeting on November 21 to cease its activities and possibly transfer the proceeds of its collections to the German Colonial Society for use in the interests of the donors. The Committee will continue to devote its greatest attention to the question of the slave trade, so that the obligations which Germany has assumed in accordance with the Imperial Throne Speech of November 22, 1888, with regard to winning Africa for Christian morality, are completely fulfilled. The formation of new sections was announced and the Committee expressed its gratitude to the gentlemen who had contributed to their creation. - New sections of the Society have been formed in the following towns: Salzwedel, founded November 5. I. Chairman: Gymnasialdirektor Dr. Legerloy. - Kreuznach, founded November 9. I. Chairman: Court bookseller Reinh. Schmithals. - Nördlingen, founded November 10.
l. Chairman: Komm.=Rat Rohmer. 1st secretary and treasurer: Hauptlehrer Hüdler. - Bergzabern, founded November 13. l. Chairman: Königl. Oberamtsrichter Dr. Bauer. - Offenbach a. M., founded November 14. - Prenzlau, founded November 19. Dr. Carl Peters has given lectures in a number of departments of the German Colonial Society over the last few weeks, greeted everywhere by enthusiastic cheers. On November 8, the Dresden branch, in conjunction with the conservative association, celebrated him in a very cordial manner. The meeting, which was also attended by His Majesty the King of Saxony and Her Highnesses Princess Matbilde and Prince Albrecht, and which was extremely well attended, was opened by Hofrath Dr. Credé, who gave the floor to Mr. Peters to describe his experiences on his Emin Pasha expedition. After Dr. Mehnert had given an enthusiastically received toast to Dr. Peters, the meeting was followed by a reception, during which Achivar Dr. Richter and Privy Councillor Ackermann celebrated the African traveler, who thanked Privy Councillor Dr. Creds and Dr. Mehnert, men who were enthusiastic about the national cause. After a toast by Privy Councillor Credé to Dr. Peters' comrades, which was returned by Captain Lieutenant Rust, Dr. Mehnert, among others, offered a toast to Bismarck and Caprivi. The banquet, which passed in a very animated mood, brought a series of toasts from Dr. Ceedé, In. Meh nert. Dr. Peters, Borchert and Fritz Bley, the latter of whom, in a rousing toast to German women that was received with lively applause, extolled the element that had always supported colonial efforts. Dr. Peters was, as we would like to point out, presented with the first class knighthood of the Order of Albrecht and was received by the King together with his companions in a lengthy audience. On November 11, Dr. Peters, who was joined by Leuinant von Tiedemann, spoke in Koblenz, where Vergrat Dr. Busse welcomed the guests. The first speaker was Captain Richelmann, who spoke about the economic prospects of East Africa, while after Mr. lu. Peters, Lieutenant von Tiedemann spoke about the tribes in Africa which he had met on the German Emin Pasha expedition. Banquet and festive reception, at which District Administrator Count Brühl, Bergrat Dr. Busse, Excellency Kusserow, Colonel Behm, Lord Mayor Schüller, garrison priest Montag. Dr. Fabri, etc., testified to the interest shown in the German colonial cause in Koblenz. On the 12th, the Peters celebration took place in Essen a. R., at which Dr. Bädeker welcomed the guests. At the banquet, toasts were given by Mr. Goldkuhle, Dr. Bädeker, District Court Judge Schneider and Bank Director Müller. - The following day, Captain Richelmann and Dr. Peters spoke in Krefeld at a meeting opened by Dr. Pahde. At the banquet, District Administrator Dr. Limbourg, Pastor Schulz, Senior Pastor D. Schmitz and District Court Judge Lauer gave speeches. - Karlsruhe department. On the 19th of this month, the local department held a lecture evening in the large museum hall, which was attended by an exceptionally large number of men and women. (About 800 people may have attended.) The lecture was given by the African researcher Dr. Haus Meyer from Leipzig. He spoke about "the history of the discovery of the equatorial African snow mountains", of which the speaker himself created a considerable part through his repeated ascents of Kilimanjaro. The fact that the uppermost part of the mountain forms a glaciated crater was first established by Meyer In marked contrast to Stanley's views on the Ruwenzori Mountains, Meyer rather understands the high mountains of Abyssinia, the land of origin of the Blue Nile, as the Mountains of the Moon, from which the Nile is said to originate according to the descriptions of the Greek geographer Ptolemy from the second century AD; according to Meyer, the ancients had no knowledge of the White Nile at all. Meyer, whose lecture was repeatedly honored by lively applause, expressed his intention to continue his research on the Central African glacier world in Kenya next year - the next day Meyer was received in audience by H.R.H. the Grand Duke. - Rudolstadt Department. On November 8, Dr. Neubaur gave a lecture on "German East Africa and the economic tasks there" in the course of a larger tour in Rudolstadt for the purpose of forming a department. The lecture was attended by Their Serene Highnesses Princess Mother and Princess Thekla, sister of the reigning Prince, as well as all the heads of the authorities. The formation of the departments took place after the presentation: I. Chairman: District Court President Berninger. II. chairman: Minister von Starck Excellency. Secretary: Bookseller Keil ubteilung Antwerpen. On the 30th of Otto, Mr. Privatdotent Dr. Grosse from Mogdeburg gave a lecture on the contribution of German explorers to the exploration of Africa - The Körn Division celebrated a private party on the 14th in honour of its member Captain Richelmann, who had returned from East Africa. About 300 gentlemen, including many officers, filled the large hall of the Fränkischer Hof, while the gallery was occupied by ladies from the members' circles. After welcoming the meeting and the guest of honor by the chairman, the Privy Councillor of Commerce Eugen Langen, Captain Richelmann took the floor for an extremely clear and gripping presentation on the tasks solved and still to be solved by the East African protection force, on the nature of the country in German East Africa and the characteristics and abilities of its inhabitants, on the economic and political successes already achieved and still to be achieved there, as well as on the beneficial work of the Catholic missions in particular. The speaker gave a lot of interesting information from the wealth of experience he has gathered and concluded with the words: "We were put in the saddle in East Africa and now we are supposed to ride ourselves. We want to

binauf to the Great Lakes, that's where the prize is. If Wißmann has the means to transport the sea steamers, then we can rely on him and his companions to do a job that we can be proud of." The speaker then conveyed the Reichskommissar's warm farewell greetings to the people of Cologne and celebrated Cologne as the real stronghold of the original Africa movement, where it was possible, especially during the worst crises of our colonial policy, to spread enthusiasm for Africa to the broad masses and at the same time to interest powerful capital circles in it. Struckmann and Colonel Heinrichs celebrated the speaker as an enthusiastic and loyal fighter for the colonial cause and as a dashing, conscientious officer and brave comrade. A gentleman from the assembly interpellated the speaker about Jephson's remark in his book that Emin Pasha had complained to Captain Richelmann, then commander of Bagamovo, "in the harshest terms" about the fact that the Englishmen from the Stanley Expedition were not allowed to join him. Captain Richelmann provided the following information: "The German doctors from the Schutztruppe and the Imperial Navy had diagnosed a severe skull fracture in Emin. The same was confirmed by a missionary who was very involved in medical studies. When Emin Pasha, who was himself a doctor, regained full consciousness, he also confirmed it. Despite this, Stanley had his doctor, Dr. Parke, declare that there was no skull fracture and that the German doctors and the missionary were mistaken. Only much later did Dr. Parke also admit that his German colleagues' diagnosis was correct. Stanley absolutely wanted to take Emin Pasha with him to use him for his triumph, and the English doctor declared that Emin was fit for transportation. Emin himself, however, was convinced of the impossibility of a journey, and consent on his part would almost have been suicide. Stanley now sent over one of his officers after another to persuade Emin to go with him. The people did this - in the English interest, of course - and wanted to dissuade him absolutely from us; after all, they knew what Emin could be in our service. Emin Pasha is a German through and through, and was treated so badly by Stanley on the way that he could have no warm feeling for him. To the statement in Mr. Jephson's book I can only reply that the gentlemen were by no means purposely prevented from going from Zanzibar to Bagamoyo, but that they were perhaps not offered such a homely journey as they wished. The command of the Schutz truppe was not in a position to make any other use of the steamers which had been requisitioned for us than was done. Mr. Casati once made a similar complaint to me, but he was well aware of how difficult it was to make a really good connection and that the fault lay only in the circumstances, not in us. Personally, I was always happy to see Casati in Bagamovo, especially as I knew that he was always a dear visitor for Emin. However, the Pasha did say in my presence that he was surprised when his previous traveling companions were made more difficult to visit, but this was not done "in the harshest terms", but in a conversational tone. For me it was simply a duty at that time to keep visits away from the patient as far as possible. I myself went to the Latareti every day, but by no means to see the seriously ill Emin, as the doctors urgently wanted Rube, even though the patient sometimes longed for entertainment. If the English gentlemen could not understand that a terminally ill man needed as much Rube as possible and that it was their duty to provide him with this Rube to the best of their ability, the blame for this lack of understanding does not lie with us." In the further course of the reception, patriotic and colonial songs alternated with thrilling toasts, such as those by Canon Hefpers to Emin Pasha and Chief State Attorney Hamm to the German-East African Society and the Rhineland industry, which is always prepared to make sacrifices for Africa; finally, by Privy Councillor Eugen Langen to the idealism pulsating strongly in our society, without which a German-Africa would not be possible. - (The lecture tour that Captain Richelmann undertook for the German Colonial Society will be dealt with in context after its completion). For the Wißmann steamer on the Victoria Nyanza, the Cologne branch of the German Colonial Society had received 278 contributions totaling 35,000 M. by the 15th of this month. The individual donations ranged between 3000 M. and 2 M., proof of how much all circles of the Rhenish population are prepared to sacrifice for the great undertaking of Reichskommissar v. Wißmann. Further contributions are still in prospect. Berzzabern in the Rhine Palatinate. At a meeting on November 13, which was very well attended by all sections of the population, the chairman of the neighboring Baden section of Karlsrube, President Grimm, spoke as representative of the central board about the German Schupgebiete, their origins and further development, as well as the colonial goals to be pursued. Mr. Redver emphasized that he considered our German colonial occupation to be a product of the powerful impulse in the German people to expand overseas and that the German Colonial Society should definitely be regarded as the appointed bearer of this popular conviction. Incidentally, there were still great and important tasks for the society in the future, which the speaker listed in detail. A large number of inventory pieces from the Karlsrube department, namely a whole cycle of large and very instructive wall maps, two flags in the German colors introduced in our African territories, murals with poignant scenes from the slave trade, photographs of New Guinea and South Africa, the Hellgrewe pictures and the KilimaNdscharo pictures by Hans Meyer illustrated the speech. The speaker's wish, expressed at the end of the presentation, which was received with lively applause, that the city of Berazabern should also join the newly founded sections in 27 cities read out by the speaker in the last six months, will certainly be granted after the impressions of this evening. Numerous applications to join the association have already been received and the formation of a hopefully very strong department is imminent. President Grimm expressed the thanks and appreciation of the German Colonial Society to the organizer of the meeting and long-time member of the association, Chief Magistrate Franz Xaver Bauer in Bergzabern, for his efforts in bringing together a department. Small announcements. - (The collections for the Wißmann steamer.) Some newspapers hostile to our colonial endeavors have recently dropped hints as if the amounts subscribed by the participants for the Victoria Nyanza steamer on the occasion of the banquet given by Major v. Wißmann in Hamburg had not been paid in or had been withdrawn. In response to an inquiry to Captain v. Gravenreuth, we have been informed that, according to the Hamburg paying office, all the subscribed amounts have already been received in mid-September, amounting to 77,780 marks. The ridicule with which the high-minded and patriotic men who have contributed to this enterprise have been showered by the anti-colonial press is therefore self-evident. (Lectures on international and German colonial law) have, as we are told with reference to the note in No. 24, been held at the University of Heidelberg since 1888 by Dr. Heimburger, a private lecturer in law, especially in the summer; these lectures have been very well attended by students from all faculties. - In Tübingen this winter Pros. Schäfer is giving a lecture entitled "Geschichte des Kolonialwesens seit dem 16. Jahrhundert. (From the Mission Department of the Brethren Church) in Verthelsdorf is written to us: Jn No. 23 of the "Deutsche Kolonialzeitung" of November 1, 1890, on page 279, under a communication from Gumbinnen about a lecture by Pastor Petrenz, there is the following passage: "Of the missionaries trained in Halle, two traveled to St. Thomas in 1732 with se 18 marks travel money and two to Greenland in 1733.... The Brethren congregation (despite its small size) had done more for the missionary cause than the whole of Christendom in two centuries." Perhaps you would be kind enough to include the following brief correction: The four missionaries who went out in 1732 and 1733 were not trained in Halle, but were simple craftsmen and were sent out by the Brethren congregation quite independently of Halle. As far as the missionary activity and missionary successes of the Brethren congregation are concerned, we rejoice, with thanksgiving to God, that the Brethren congregation is not only the oldest German missionary society, but also the largest to this day. If, however, its rapporteur says that "it has done more for the missionary cause than the whole of Christendom has done in two centuries", we feel bound in the interest of truth to describe this expression, in all modesty, as going far too far and not corresponding to the truth. The missionary work and missionary successes of the Brethren evoke lively thanksgiving to God, who can call even a small force to great works, but they are always only a small part of the great, blessed ardeil. Finally, please allow us to inform you that the Brethren Church has decided to start a new missionary activity in German East Africa, initially at Lake Nyassa. (For sportsmen) East Africa is no longer favorable ground. As the Times reports, an Australian who wanted to hunt in East Africa was refused entry by the Reichskommissariat. The British company also no longer allows hunting expeditions into the interior. (The General Assembly of the German East African Society), which was also attended by Privy Legation Councillor Dr. Kayser and Legation Councillor von Nordenflycht, also discussed the new statutes of the Society on November 20 after approving the aforementioned treaty by 2000 votes to 45. Former Consul Vohsen resigned his position as a result of differences that arose regarding his future position. Mr. Vohsen rendered outstanding services to the Society at critical moments. In 1888, he prepared the takeover of the coast and, after the suppression of the uprising, concluded the new treaty with the Sultan and created new foundations for the prosperous development of trade in East Africa. Mr. Ebenau, who was the representative of the House of O Swald in Zanzibar for many years, will go to East Africa as the representative of the Directorate. (Kaiser Wilhelmsland = plantation company). Under the chairmanship of Privy Councillor von Hansemann, the constitution of the "Kaiser Wilhelmsland Plantation Society" took place in Hamburg on the 13th. The purpose of the company is to establish mainly cocoa and coffee plantations in the New Guinea Company's shooting range in the South Seas. The company capital amounts to 500,000 marks, which is to be issued in 1000 shares of 500 marks each. (Between Portugal and England) a modus vivendi has been created, which has the following content: 1. the Portuguese government undertakes to immediately decree freedom of navigation on the Zambest and the Schire; L. it permits and facilitates the movement of goods on both rivers, as well as on the Pongwe, and opens land roads at those points,

Page 306

3. it facilitates the traffic between the Portuguese ports and the countries of the British sphere of interest, especially with regard to mail, telegraphy and the transportation of goods; 4. both Governments recognize the frontiers as established in the treaty of August 20, in the sense that for the duration of the present treaty neither of the two Powers shall be responsible for the transportation of goods. telegraphy and the transportation of goods; 4. both Governments recognize the frontiers established by the treaty of August 20, in the sense that during the duration of the present agreement neither Power can conclude a treaty, assume a protectorate, or exercise an act of sovereignty in those regions which have been transferred to the sphere of influence of the other Power; b. by this agreement no question shall be prejudged for further negotiations. The agreement came into force on November 13 and is provisionally valid for six months. - (Stauley) has finally formulated his accusation against Barttelot and Jameson more precisely and has come out with all the documents which are in fact capable of incriminating both of them considerably. On Stanley's side stands Bonny, who goes through thick and thin with him, while Rose Troup and Ward defend the first defendant. The Times has published both the rearguard's logbook and a sworn document from the Syrian interpreter, the latter accusing Jameson of having masterminded the murder of a girl in order to witness a lannibalistic scene. The dolman later withdrew his testimony before the Emin Pasha Committee, but a letter from Jameson to his wife reveals that Jameson indirectly caused the outrage. The sketches which he allegedly made at the cannibalistic feast, he claims to have drawn only later. Whatever the case may be, it casts a bad light on the English who regarded Emin Pasha's "ride" as a humanitarian task. Barttelot became delusional as a result of the deprivations and then committed a series of shameful atrocities, and the naturalist Jameson, who is described as an otherwise calm man, made all sorts of doubting remarks about cannidalism, and the Arabs rushed to demand a gift from him to help him to the spectacle. The ugly quarrel is not yet at an end, but Stanley has gained nothing by it. Punch, who often enough characterizes the situation in his Karions, published a picture in his last issue which shows on one side the wheels of Barttelot and Jameson, and on the other Stanley, who stretches out his arm imploringly towards Justitia, who holds the scales folded up in her hand and stares forlornly into the distance (The budget of the Colonial Office for 1891) demands 3½ million marks for East Africa against 4½ million in the current year. The fund for the development of the hinterlands in Togo and Cameroon has been increased from 150,000 to 200,000, and 25,000 marks have been set aside for South-West Africa to promote German settlements. The last innovation will be of particular interest to all those who have been advocating the necessity of facilitating settlement in South West Africa for years. (Bagamovo=Dar=es=Salaam Railway.)

Jun d. 3 Mr. Rajor Liebert pointed out that the Reichskommder Mr. Najor could best be greeted by the German people through a steamer "Wihma" to be procured for the Victoria=Der. In addition, Mr. Rajor von Weimann in Vermen and Hamburg has himself given the strongest expression to this wish. The idea of organizing meetings for a "Dompser Wetmenn" in Leipzig has also touched the uterine mind. But the summer collections for the Carl Peters Foundation also have a similar purpose. Originally, the choice of this enterprise was to be left open to Dr. Carl Peters. Recently, however, Dr. Peters has declared that "the procurement of a steamer for the ViktontoGee would only satisfy his wishes". The committee of the Corl Feters Foundation has approached us with the request to collect money for the foundation in Beipzig. With regard to the fact that both collections serve the same purpose, that both are not only intended to equally enrich our great Uftikaner Wihmann and Beters, but also to meet the most lively wishes and the urgent needs of the third great African Emind, that the server of the Dompser "Wetan" already seems to be secured by the collections of Vermen and Homburg and that the collections of other places will most likely also enable the grounding of a Dompfer "Emin" for the Tangandiko= or the Ryasso-Ter, we believe, to avoid a fragmentation of the forces in our city n propose to the members of our association and other friends of our colonies to make contributions only for a steamer "Petero" We will allow ourselves to present a collection sheet through a messenger. We will refrain from a public communion in view of the summer collections caused by the water emergency." The following contributions have been made: N. N. N. 80 M; Grio Narer srege & Ce. 120 M.; LU.

Call for support for Emin Pasha's proposals. (For once, proposals that have hand and foot, whose clarity and simplicity catch the eye, whose feasibility is obvious to everyone and which have the advantage over all others. They do not come from one-sided theorists or practitioners, they come from a man who unites theory and practice in a rare way, who can look back on brilliant successes in his administrative work and is therefore recognized everywhere as a leader in these matters. None other than Emin Pasha, the governor of the Aquatorial Province for many years, submitted his program to the German people. When considering his proposals, the reader is involuntarily struck by the thought of the advantage Germany has gained over other countries through the acquisition of this rare, one might even say unique, man. Who else could promise with a clear conscience that the costs of such an undertaking would be balanced out by the income after three years? And even if some would promise it, who would trust these promises, which can only be based on assumptions! With Emin, and he is unique in this respect, the situation is different. What he is planning in German East Africa, he has already accomplished on the Nile. He has brought the Aquatorial Province, which used to cost Egupten large sums year in, year out, first to the point where it was self-sustaining, and finally to the point where it was able to deliver a surplus. Who could offer better guarantees for the fulfillment of his promises? Since the Germans are in the fortunate position of being able to call such a man, about whose efficiency as an administrative official there is only one opinion, their own, they, for their part, should do everything possible to open up a sphere of activity for him, in which he can bring his proven qualities to bear for the good of his homeland9 and for the benefit of the still uncultivated tribes, which he wants to lead without haste, step by step, slowly but surely towards better conditions. which is the envy of friend and foe alike, thereby imposes on itself the obligation before the world to make the best possible use of his strength, to enable him to carry out his grandiose plans, which are so inexpensive and promise such significant results, and not to create any obstacles for him in the pursuit of his goals. Emin wants to establish the administration of the northern lake district, the best, but also the most endangered of all. ) See number 25 of the D. Colon.=Zig. under Correipondences.
As a first condition he demands unrestricted power. It may be questionable to entrust a person with such power, but if someone is to be fully responsible for the execution of his plans in such wild, densely populated, warlike countries, he must not be bound by all kinds of restrictions. If anyone can be granted this power without hesitation, it is Emin. For years he possessed it in his province and the worst enemy cannot accuse him of the slightest abuse. His former position, his long activity as an absolute ruler, his reputation in scientific circles, in the broad strata of the people, indeed in the whole world, his advanced age, all forbid that he should be subordinated to a man of lesser experience in administrative matters. It is precisely in the role of mediator, of conciliator, which he claims to have chosen for himself, that he absolutely needs unrestricted power. He must have it precisely in these endangered regions, since the slightest uncertainty could tarnish his reputation among Arabs and rulers. They would be disappointed in their high opinion of him if they somehow discovered that he did not have a free hand. And this disappointment could not only disrupt his work, it could also take bitter revenge. But he not only needed force to promote his plans among Arabs and rulers, he also needed it against influences from Europe that could endanger his work and delay, if not make impossible, the fulfillment of his promise. It was to these, unfortunately from time to time regularly recurring disturbances of the colonization and administrative activities by influences from Europe that the ode-branded expression, perhaps alienating to some, referred: "It is, to use Emin's phrase, "the vexed question of slavery" that causes these obstacles Anyone familiar with the situation knows that a major English newspaper has assumed the leading role in these matters and at certain times raises a battle cry that unfortunately goes unchecked and unheeded by most newspapers. Strangely enough, these times always tend to coincide with those in which English commercial or private interests feel somehow threatened or impaired. Recent events must have opened the eyes of even those unfamiliar with African affairs. When the Anglo-German treaty was concluded, there was the hope that the main causes of the cries for war would also be silenced. Everyone knows how this hope was dashed. Although that paper suffered a heavy defeat at that time, nothing justifies the assumption that it could not proceed to a repetition. On the contrary, it is waiting for the moment to wipe out the slate clean and halt the progress of the Germans, which may soon be felt unquestionably enough. These battle cries exert tremendous pressure on public opinion and have a tremendously disruptive effect on the activities of the

 Officials in Africa, who could be made insecure and unstable as a result And this must not happen again, especially with Emin. The measures to be taken can be left entirely to him, the man with the most thorough knowledge of the circumstances and the country, the proven philanthropist. No pressure of any kind may be exerted on him within the stipulated period if the success of his enterprise is not to be called into question. This discussion was mainly prompted by a distortion of Emin's words in the telegraphic reports of the English newspapers about his program. This distortion (by omitting two very important words) is at least strange under the circumstances. Emin writes: "Our task for the moment is the ruthless suppression of the slave trade on a large scale" rc. The last two words are omitted, which completely changes the meaning. It almost seems as if the hook had already been hinted at, on which a trap could be set for Emin at the appropriate time, i.e. when he is in the middle of his activities. In order to make such behavior as unobjective as possible, it is highly necessary to enlighten the people about the meaning of the two words. The slave trade on a large scale, i.e. the practice of the same by exclusive traders, can probably be gradually suppressed in the interior as the occupation progresses. The situation is different with small-scale trade, from hand to hand, which is difficult to detect and eradicate even in occupied places; even Egypt, which is occupied and ruled by the English, does not yet seem to be free of it. If the principle already applies to governments in Europe: "What you cannot enforce, you should not try to enforce", how much more so in Africa? The decree which the English consul obtained from the Sultan of Sansidar was unenforceable from the outset and was also a flagrant injustice against the remaining slaves. Complete abolition was far preferable to such a decree. The only result it brought Germany was the tragedy at Witu The last drum roll of the English paper was, as is well known, based on trade. It would not hesitate to unleash such a fuss against Emin as soon as his successes became apparent. Everyone should therefore be aware in advance that they should no longer pay any attention to it. Of the reasons that may have prompted Emin to treat this issue with the utmost caution in these regions in particular, we will only discuss one in more detail: the Mahdists. Emin's earlier letters indicate that the Arabs in Tabora were already preparing to make contact with them via Unjoro. Fortunately, Emin was already nearby and it was thanks to his presence that this plan was thwarted. Careless, overly violent intervention would undoubtedly lead to a renewal of the attempts. If they were successful, we could be forced to make completely different expenditures than those Emin is now demanding for pacification and subjugation. Only when England has completely defeated Mahdiomus can Germany, without running the risk of being forced to make great sacrifices of money and human lives, introduce stricter and more comprehensive measures against the African evil. England has it in her power to smash the most dangerous pillar of the evil, the Mahdiomus, but refrains from doing so because of the costs. As long as it does not rid itself and its neighbors of this Alp (about which they seem to be better informed in Cairo than they tell the world), it must be left to everyone to decide what measures he considers expedient in his territory, especially to the greatest expert on the situation there, Emin Pasha. Therefore, what is to be done and ordered must be left entirely to him alone. That is why he needs unrestricted power. As far as his proposals themselves are concerned, no one will have any objections to them. Only the modest sum with which he undertakes to carry out such a gigantic work is astonishing. The promised result would not be too expensive to pay three times as much. May his modest request therefore be granted and no disappointment felt should unforeseen circumstances prove this request to be insufficient. Everyone will share the conviction that the Briton, if Emin were in his service, would gladly grant him every condition and would gladly place double the sum at his disposal. Let us therefore give the Englishman no reason to boast that he would have understood better how to appreciate and utilize Emin's abilities instead of the Germans. To prevent this from happening, it is not enough to admire Emin's program and confine ourselves to a few words of praise. Joder, who is enthusiastic about the opening up of Africa, the most rational suppression of slavery, etc., should do everything in his power to enable the rare man, whose services a kindly fate has secured for us through the strangest concatenation of circumstances, to carry out his plans. Just as the most powerful stream ultimately emerges only from the union of small and smallest rivulets, so also public opinion is composed of the concentrated sum of the views of individuals, which in themselves mean nothing at all. Only the existence of such a stream makes it possible for those who are called upon to develop their full effectiveness Even at those heights where the final decisions are made, clarity about the general views is welcome. There, too, it is desirable to be supported by public opinion in order to make the necessary decisions in harmony with it. But how can this be achieved if public opinion is not clear and unambiguous? And everyone, even the least of us, can contribute to this. In this case, in particular, the accusation that was made with full justification at the time of the conclusion of the Anglo-German Treaty, that while the English experts moved heaven and earth to create public opinion, the Germans put their hands in their laps only to raise a completely useless lament when it was too late, cannot be raised again. Therefore, all of you, each in your own circle, each according to your own way, stir yourselves to support Emin. Even you, men of science, who have always praised Emin as a beacon and refuge of science, do not content yourselves with proudly pointing to him and praising his merits, but unite your enormous strength, which you yourselves perhaps underestimate, to offer him a helping hand in achieving his and your goals. And you, influential press of Germany, grant to the support of his plans only a small part of the space that was devoted to the discussions about the Stanley Emin case at that time. It should be borne in mind that the mere words of uninvolved parties weigh light as a feather against the deeds and assertions of a man like Stanley, but that Emin's new deeds are capable of brilliantly demonstrating Stanley's errors and the groundlessness of his attacks to the whole world. Not words against words, but deeds against deeds. So thought Emin, as he immediately went back to work to defend himself. Press Germany, follow the example, lend your support to Emin's plans and prepare a revenge the likes of which the world has rarely seen before. For if Emin succeeds in carrying out his plan, no one will be left in doubt as to which of the two has achieved the greater, the more difficult feat. Even the press, which is not very fond of colonialist talk, should support Emin's plan if it does not want to be accused of inconsistency. After all, he is developing the same policy of reconciliation and peace that it has always advocated as the only expedient direction, in contrast to the one pursued in the beginning. Just how conciliatory and accommodating Emin is in this respect is clear from the far-reaching concessions he makes to his opponents regarding the value of the coastal landscapes and the Arab cultural element. Here, too, he may think that the results of his and other deeds will best refute the prevailing hostile views. Vioher was speaking mainly to the cool, sober mind of the German reader. May it now be permitted to address a few words to the German heart, which, as we have seen in the slavery question, still beats warmly and enthusiastically in the breast of thousands. A man who is on the threshold of old age, who has no more time to lose on earth, who wishes to utilize every hour that is still granted to him for the good of mankind and his immediate fatherland, turns to the German ration. The work to which he dedicated his past life, which is unparalleled in the history of Africa, is gone, destroyed and not through his fault. With shattered hopes, a poor, lonely man, but a man whose possessions are friend and foe

Page 309

considered equal to a kingdom in Africa, he returned to the coast. The British offered him a huge sum for his cooperation, which he refused in order to serve his fatherland with his modest salary. Because of the German Empire, he incurred the wrath of his companions, who would never have vented their anger had he devoted his activities to British interests. In the evening of his life, he was forced to rebuild his work from scratch. But he set to work joyfully and confidently, hoping to persevere until he was able to enable capable workers to shape what he had begun into a magnificent building that would bear witness to the power and glory of the German Empire for centuries to come. For the sake of his Jdeal, he renounced all the honors that awaited him in Europe, all rest and diversion, his own justification, the description of his work, which would have earned him hundreds of thousands, the care of his weakened body, in short, everything that most Europeans consider almost indispensable. Everyone, everyone defended him at the time in the ugly, purposeless Stanley controversy. Should he now be denied the opportunity to prove to the man of the most ruthless energy and the most powerful willpower, but who is incapable of judging others fairly precisely because of the unconditional predominance of these qualities, that gentler characters can achieve far greater and more useful things Should not everyone do their part to compensate for the sacrifices that this man has made and is still making for us with the only thing that seems to him to be compensation? And that is the granting of the authority and the means to carry out his plans, which are so advantageous for the empire. Will they want to leave him in the lurch now, when a work so useful not only for Germany but for the great aspirations of civilization is at stake? Aeber Ansiedelungsverhältnisse in Südwest-Afrika vom Gesichtspunkte der organisirten Kolonisation. It is one of the fondest hopes of the friends of German colonization that it may be possible to settle German emigrants in our colonies, to keep them in the closest connection with the mother country, and by preparing a new home for them on their own land, where they can find a comfortable existence, to use the colonists at the same time as a cultural element in the midst of a still uncivilized population. It is not without good reason that the attention of those who have taken a closer look at this subject has repeatedly been drawn to South West Africa, which seemed to be lost when the promise of profit from the subterranean treasures that the country undoubtedly harbors could not be obtained with the desired speed. If the prospects that conjured up the image of a rich gold country with an abundance of earthly goods had been realized as quickly as expected, we would certainly have been relieved of the trouble of thinking about what now had to be done to advance the development of the colony. However, the property has not become worthless because it is brittle and cannot be acquired effortlessly. Although much has already been written in the Kolonialzeitung about settlement, about the presumed prosperity and about the opportunities for earning a living that are available in the country, there is still a lack of clear work to which ideas of regulated colonization can be linked and which could be immediately followed by implementation. This attempt will be made in the following and thus a suggestion for improvement will be given. The choice of settlement sites. For practical colonization in South West Africa, it is of decisive importance to find some "places where it is possible to settle a larger number of colonists. On the one hand, the settlers living together in closed communities provides external security, and on the other hand, better facilities and extensive care can be linked to the undertaking. The present time seems particularly favorable to tackle two places for settlement that meet all justified requirements for security and prosperity. Windhoek, a place with excellent springs on the slopes of the Awas Mountains, has become vacant due to the death of the well-known Hottentot chief Jan Jonker and has not been reoccupied by the dispersed remnants of his tribe, and Hoachanas, the former headquarters of the Red People, has likewise been destroyed by the native wars. Apart from these two places, there are no major sources in the country, if we disregard the Waterberg, where some places are occupied by Bergd, and the still unknown north of the colony, which is hardly suitable for German settlement. However, individual families may be able to find sufficient water and grazing land in some other places without disturbing the natives in their property, but we assume that organized colonization must take into account the possibility of a number of families living together. Both Windhoek and Hoachanas offer sufficient drinking water and water for use, and the grazing land in both places is quite extensive. Their location is somewhat far in the interior of the country, but experience has shown that this does not present any difficulties. This does not hinder the sale of the products and the connection with the coast (to Walfischbai or Angra Pequena) could be made regular as soon as a German colonist life blossomed in these places. Now we must point out another circumstance that seems important with regard to the location of the places. It is precisely in this area that the pastures of the Herero and Nama meet. If it were possible to create a neutral zone between the two peoples through German colonization, this would be the most effective way of ensuring peace between the Herero and Nama. A German community, with the simplest rural administration, composed of well-mannered people accustomed to order and work, could serve as a model for the cultural upliftment of the country on both sides, north and south. This would also create a neutral market on which both sides, the Herero and Nama, could sell their products and meet their needs without envy. Anyone who takes the history of the country into consideration knows how much benefit can be expected from such an institution. The proposal to colonize Windhoek and Hoachanas, however, presupposes that the imperial government exercises its patronage by first of all ordering the disturber of peace in the country, Chief Hendrik Wittboy of Gibeon, to whom an English trader named Duncan is supplying arms and ammunition for continued raids and war campaigns, to keep peace and order. After that, it will be easy to broker a new general peace under the care of the Empire, whereby the free territories would have to be declared crown lands for the purpose of colonization, as was already inaugurated in the seventies by English policy through Commissioner Palgrave. The latter had prepared the ground in an excellent manner, so that in many respects it was only necessary to follow his drafts, which were drawn up under the supervision of the missionary Hahn. The troop "for protection and defense in Tsaobis" could hardly be kept together in its stronghold in an expedient manner; the introduction of an administration in our colony, however primitive, analogous to the English one in Betschuanaland, would probably necessitate its dissolution and its use as a police force in small detachments at various stations in the country anyway. We will not go into this subject in detail, but will return to it in a later article. There is no doubt that the Herero, like the Nama, will gladly agree to the German settlements in Windhoek and Hoachanas, from which both parties can only expect advantages. The use of water. With every settlement and undertaking in South-West Africa, the first concern is always the available water and the extent to which it can be used for cultivation. This fact alone makes it necessary for the immigration of colonists to be monitored and to proceed according to certain rules. If the immigrant were to be left free to choose a settlement on the crown lands at any place and in the extent he desired, this would cause great disturbances for later immigration. Those water points whose use is sufficient for a larger number of settlers cannot be taken into possession by individuals as private property. A regulated settlement on Crown lands must in principle treat this question as a public matter. In Windhock, as in Hoachanas, there are a number of larger and smaller springs that supply the sites with water. The indigenous people, who used to live here in large numbers in earlier times, had facilities for the use of water which have been lost in the ongoing wars of recent decades. In the 1940s, around 500 people lived on the Windhoek square, whose households and gardens were protected by

Page 310

 water pipes, which made the water from the large springs usable for extensive garden areas. To the extent that the existing springs can be used to irrigate garden land, a larger number of homes for German settlers will be created. The use of trickling water for each household depends on the extent of the garden land belonging to it. The latter should not be given a larger extension than the needs of the individual household for garden crops make necessary. On the other hand, each household or homestead must also be allocated the necessary garden land with the possibility of being able to water it sufficiently. A body to be appointed by the municipality or the supervising administration shall ensure the proper use of the water. The homestead and the grazing rights It is merely a question of organization whether the homesteads should all be of the same size or whether they should offer the possibility of transferring or selling a more extensive possession of garden land to the settler with more means. Without exception, the homestead must become the free property of the settler; he may dispose of the land belonging to him without restriction. Since experience has shown that the German emigrant possesses more labour than capital, it must be the task of well-managed colonization to facilitate in every way the settlement in South West Africa of ambitious and blameless persons who have once decided to emigrate, and to favour their economic activities. In the beginning, the land for a homestead should be given to the settler free of charge, or at least under the most favorable conditions, if the settler is willing to live on it and cultivate the land. He can build a house with a small stable himself, as the building material, clay for making bricks, which quickly dry and harden in the sun, as well as wood and grass for the roofing are plentiful everywhere. The expenses for doors and windows, the only things that have to be purchased for money, are to be advanced to him on account, or the doors and windows, which can be taken from Germany ready-made, are to be supplied on credit, insofar as his means are not sufficient for cash payment. Each homestead shall include the right to use pastureland, to be measured according to its extent. The number of large and small livestock the settler is allowed to keep is not a question that is important from the outset. In Windhoek and Hoachanas, the associated grazing land is so extensive that, given the possible number of homesteads, a relatively large number of livestock is permitted for the individual settler. However, a limit should be set from the outset, as cattle, goats and sheep multiply extremely quickly there, so that the herds can grow too large and cause disturbances in years of fodder shortage. It would correspond to the acquisition and maintenance conditions in South West Africa if the usual homestead were granted grazing rights for 50 head of large cattle and 200 head of small cattle. It is therefore not necessary to exclude the larger farm, but can even make it as easy as possible for well-off settlers under conditions to be determined, which must be adapted to local conditions. Dr. Bokemeyer. (Conclusion follows. Cameroon.") Having described the history of the voyages of discovery in the northern Cameroon region in the previous two articles, it is still incumbent upon us to shed light on the important question of border regulation, which is more urgent today than ever before, and to summarize the consequences of the above. July 1890 stipulates that the provisional boundary between the German territory of Cameroon and the adjacent British territory is a line running from the upper end of the Rio del Rey Creek in a straight line to the point at about 9° 81 east longitude, which is marked Rapids on the British Admiralty map. Since the line to Jola am Benns is generally secured from the Rapids by the agreement with England of 1886, unfortunately the natural *) See the map in No. 20 of the "Kolonialzeitung".
extension to Ibi am Benus was unexpectedly abandoned, Major Macdonald had been sent to Berlin by the British government to discuss the more detailed definition of the border with Baron v. Soden, the Governor of Cameroon. Nothing more detailed has become known about these negotiations; it is only said that the German government was unwilling to give in to the English demands and that it vigorously resisted the constant advances of the English. We could only welcome it with joy if this had been the case, as otherwise the difficulties for the expansion of our trade into the interior would have increased indefinitely. However, these negotiations connected with this border regulation seem to us to be of less importance than the question of what position the Imperial Government will later take, or perhaps has already taken, with regard to the expansion of our protectorate into the interior. The Anglo-German Convention agreed in Article V that "treaties and agreements made by or for the benefit of either Power in the regions north of the Benus shall not prejudice the right of the other Power to trade freely in transit to and from the shores of Lake Chad without the payment of transit duties. One Power shall notify the other of all treaties concluded in the territory between Lake Benuä and Lake Chad. The memorandum on the motives for the agreement declared this provision, which in itself is somewhat unclear, to be extremely useful for Cameroon after the elimination of intermediate trade. We noted the following in No. 17 of August 9: "Such a remark clears the field, so to speak, and gives the English claimants around Lake Chad an entitlement to these territories. Now that the Royal Niger Company is asserting claims to the right bank of the Bennö or Hald Jola, it seems that we have all but given up on extending our sphere of interest to Lake Chad. In addition, the French also intend to penetrate northwards from Ubangi, for which purpose the French traveler Crampel, who explored the northern part of Gadun two years ago and touched our hinterland, is said to be on his way. At this time, when the French press is trying to create a mood for the expansion of French possessions in West Africa, it is appropriate to refer to a French view of Cameroon. Even in French colonial scientific journals, one finds the legend developing that the 15th degree of longitude of Greenwich is the eastern boundary of our Cameroon colony. The French are of the opinion that the whole country between the 15th degree of longitude and the Ubangi, where they already have some stations, belongs to them... But in the face of these claims of the French, who want to confine us to the 15th degree, it is time to declare vigorously that the German government has only undertaken in the protocol of December 21, 1885, to refrain from any political influence from a line which follows the Campo River from its mouth to the 10th degree east longitude of Greenwich and from this point to its parallel of latitude to the intersection of the latter with the 15th degree east longitude of Greenwich. With the surprising rapidity with which demarcations are now being made and spheres of interest created in ways that were quite unknown a short time ago, we will have to deal with France as soon as possible about the borders of the hinterland of Cameroon and the French Congo. One could almost say that the present moment is particularly favorable for this, since territories are now being determined everywhere which, for vast distances, no white man has ever set foot on. It was therefore highly peculiar that soon afterwards the "Nordd. Allg. Ztg." published a report (see No. 18) that the agreement between England and France would also grant Germany a strip of land about 150 kilometers wide beyond Benuö, extending north to Lake Chad. This striking agreement, which seemed to assume approximately the 15th degree as the eastern borderline, was later denied; it seems that nothing has changed in the status quo, which left the land north of Benus, i.e. the hinterland of our Cameroon colony, open to competition from England and France. For the time being, Germany was not considered, as it did not have an expedition active there at the time, Dr. Zintgraff, who could have advanced most quickly from the Bali station to the upper Benus, was still in Germany, while Prime Lieutenant Morgen was entrusted with a mission in May, which was intended to advance from the Jaunde station to the sources of the Benus, or perhaps to make an advance northwards beyond Adamaua, although the expedition hardly seems sufficiently equipped for the latter purpose. It was only on October 26 that the research expedition under the command of Dr. Zintgraff, together with the trading caravan equipped by the Hamburg company Jantzen u. Thormählen, set off from Mundame on the upper course of the Mungo to Bali and Adamana.

Page 311

The situation has now become even more complicated due to the advance of the English and French. As previously reported, the former have already crossed the Mayo=Kebbi, which lies within the line that can be assumed to be the continuation of our border from Jola to Lake Chad. But then Cholet, from the Sangha, which flows into the Congo, has allegedly penetrated beyond the 10th to the 4th parallel into our protectorate, and in French newspapers one already encounters the suggestion that this has created a legal title to revise the earlier border lines. Cholet also concludes his letter to the Commissaire general, which is printed in the Journal officiel, with the words: "The simple advance that I have just completed proves the importance of the river in commercial terms. Its political importance does not need to be discussed." Two other agents, Fourneau and Fondère, are currently busy completing Cholet's discoveries. On the Riger, the expedition of Lieutenant Mizon, an old collaborator of de Brazza, was about to go to the upper Benus. However, the expedition was attacked by natives on the Niger and Mizon himself was wounded. In a letter dated November 2, which was printed in the Journal des Debats and dated from the mouth of the Niger, the Nun River, he made some new reports about the Royal Riger Company's incursions on the Niger and Benuë. These rivers are so raging that the ships need strong fuel to maintain their engines. It should therefore be possible to disembark and cut wood. However, the Royal Riger Company now wants to have "bought the banks" from the chiefs, which it believes will exclude not only foreign trade but also English competitors such as the British Merchant Association. It has a flotilla of 30 steamers at its disposal. Furthermore, Mr. Mizon reports that the Royal Niger Company has negotiated with the chief of Adamaua in order to block the Germans' route from Cameroon to Lake Chad. He was longing for an answer from the French government to his complaints and hoped that the Royal Niger Company would be induced by the Foreign Office to open the routes to Lake Chad and the Ubanghi for him, "which he would now like to explore from a purely scientific point of view, renouncing his earlier commercial purposes. Another French expedition led by Ponel is active on the Ubanghi, the right bank of which was granted to the former state by the Brussels Protocol of April 27, 1887 between France and the Congo State, and it seems that Ponel has the task of following the course of the river further in order to approach the former aquatorial province of Emin Pasha by this route. It is known that Crampel, who reached the French post of Bangui near the Zongo Rapids on September 24 with his two gunboats Ubanghi and Alima, is supposed to advance northward from Ubangh and from there to the Shari region and Lake Chad. These are, in brief, the dangers threatening our Cameroon colony, which we have summarized once again after we have always emphasized the necessity of not restricting ourselves to a relatively limited coastal area, but to reach further, to open up new trade routes so that Germany can participate in Central African trade in proportion to the size of its colonies. There was a moment when we could have taken over the trade from Adamaua if Flegel had been able to carry out his undertakings at the right time and the lower Benus had become a German possession; there was another time when we could have made up for earlier omissions by an energetic action of the imperial government against the Royal Niger Company. One can go even further and say that with a little more expenditure of resources, both the Zintgraff expedition in the north could have gone beyond the Benus and the Morgen expedition beyond the 15 degrees to the east. There is no question that this was necessary. During the period of hesitation and waiting, the French and English took courage. Just as the former are reclaiming the hinterland of our Togo colony, they will soon proceed in a similar manner in Cameroon, and if far-sighted plans are not carried out with luck at the last moment, the country explored by Barth, Beurmann and Nachtigal will be lost to us. The colonial budget and the colonial policy white papers. The colonial budget for 1890-91 shows only a few changes compared to last year's, it is still so low that it cannot be remotely compared with the colonial budgets of other states. Significant achievements are to be made with the relatively small funds, for although 3½ million are required for East Africa, the transfer of the administration from Zanzibar to the mainland, which has become necessary, and the occupation of new points on the coast will require extraordinary sums, which will be little inferior to the ordinary expenditure necessary for other administrative purposes, the establishment of the customs administration and the maintenance of the protection force and sustained support for Emin Pasha. The sum of 200,000 marks for the development of Central Africa can also be described as very moderate. Even if the expeditions in the Togo region have lost importance at the moment, there is still much to do in Cameroon, as already mentioned, quite apart from the increasingly necessary exploration of the East African region. For South West Africa, which is still very neglected, 292,300 marks have been allocated, only 22,300 marks more than in the previous year. But in addition, a very desirable extra contribution of 25,000 marks has been included to support German farmers who want to settle in South West Africa. If the government also provided for an orderly administration and the necessary protection against Hendrik Witbooy (who only recently burned Otyimbingue), including above all an increase in the protection force, the great goal of opening up this area to emigration could be pursued with full force and the ventures, which are now being planned with great capital from all sides, could come to life. The revenues for Cameroon and Togo are again sufficient to cover the necessary expenses, but the special wishes of the Germans interested in these colonies have not yet been taken into account. The budget as a whole is unlikely to give rise to much debate among the anti-colonial parties in the Reichstag due to its scarcity, while on the pro-colonial side the necessity of the excessive restriction of expenditure is unlikely to be recognized everywhere, as almost all colonial areas are pulsating with fresh and lively life and it is time to let in a breath of fresh air where stagnation still prevails. The Reichstag has also received a collection of documents concerning the murder of Germans in the Sultanate of Witu, which brings nothing new about this sad catastrophe, as the most important information has already been published in the Reichsanzeiger. The actions of the Imperial Government, which from the outset demanded immediate punishment of the culprits by the British, otherwise it would declare itself authorized to take action in Witu, will meet with general approval. The other White Paper, concerning East Africa, contains documents, some of which have also already been published in the Reichsanzeiger, but there are some reports by Dr. Schmidt on his exploratory journeys in the southern part, which contain many interesting facts. We have already pointed out earlier in the Deutsche Kolonialzeitung*) (in Nos. 7 and 8 "Die RufidschiUlanga=Linie") the great importance that this river system will one day have for the development of East Africa, and explained our opinion about it in detail. Lieutenant Dr. Schmidt has now carried out an exploration of the Rusiji estuary with the support of the S. M. S. "Schwalbe", which has shown that it is even possible for a ship such as the S. M. cruiser "Schwalbe" to penetrate the two northernmost estuaries of the river. With the steamer "München" of 6 feet draft, the river was navigated for 15 nautical miles, i.e. through the delta up to the river proper, without encountering any significant obstacles, and Schmidt assumes that if there are no rapids and falls, the river must be navigable very far up given its immense width. Where he crossed it with the expedition, about 95 nautical miles from the coast, it was still about as wide as the Elbe near Magdeburg. In our opinion, it should certainly be possible to reach the Pangani Falls with flat-bottomed steamers such as the English have built for the Zambezi; from there to the Schuguli Falls there are rapids and falls that make the overland route necessary. At these Schuguli Falls, where the widely navigable Ulanga ends, Dr. Schmidt wishes to establish a station in order to keep the Masiti in check, who are known to be just as much a terror to the local peoples as the Maasai are to those living further north If one looks at the reports from East Africa from the point of view of which tribes we still have to settle accounts with before peace and order are established, various groups can be identified. In the north, the Maasai are the enemies of the farming population; in the central area, the Wagogo ) Siche map on p. 91, vol. 1330.

Page 312

 In the area from Mahenge to Nyassa, the Masiti, who have already been defeated by the Germans several times, roam about, while the Wayao live close to the southern coast and the Wagwangwara in the hinterland up to Nyassa. A few years ago, the latter plundered the country to such an extent that no trading expedition has yet dared to march through their territory, so that today it is still completely terra incognito. It will not be easy to conquer these brave, warlike tribes, who are related to the Zulus, but it is in our interest to proceed differently in our territory than the Portuguese did in theirs. For even today the situation in Mozambique is such that the wild tribes of the interior could threaten the towns on the coast at any moment. Dr. Schmidt writes about the hinterland of Lindi, the so-called Makonde Plateau, that it is very fertile, densely forested and rich in rubber lianas. The increasing number of rubber exports from the southern ports shows that there are still treasures to be found here which are just waiting to be exploited by German entrepreneurship. The precondition is, however, that the Pao tribe, whose chief Machembe is now to be thoroughly chastised by Major Wißmann, loses its terror for the surrounding tribes. The English mission stations Masasi and Newala are unprotected today; the buildings are only of a provisional nature, as attacks by these wild tribes can be expected at any time. Lieutenant Dr. Schmidt had to fight several battles with Machembe and on October 20, Chief End stormed a strategically located village on a 600-foot-high mountain, which was well defended. The strength of the enemy was estimated to be at least 100 rifles. The examination of the Rovuma confirmed the experience of English travelers that the river will never be of great importance for shipping, and in this respect cannot be compared with the Rusiji. The nature of the coal found in the bed of the Rovuma, as well as the type and nature of the deposit described by Thomson at the time, lead Dr. Schmidt to fear that this coal neither belongs to the Carboniferous formation nor is worth mining at all. (See the informative article "Steinkohlenlager in Ostafrika" in No. 8 of the Deutsche Kolonialzeitung 1890.) Nevertheless, we do not give up hope that extensive investigations will not confirm the presence of usable coal here. The Wißzmann steamer on the Biktoria Nyanza. Having had the honor of being the first to represent Major von Wißmann's idea of procuring a German steamer for the Victoria Nyanza at the general meeting of the German Colonial Society in Cologne on July 1 of this year, I consider it my duty to advocate the promotion of this enterprise at the present time, as the Reichskommissar is away from home at his post. Unfortunately, the newspapers have reported that the funds for the Wißmann steamship have been secured. Since this news has been widely circulated, collecting for the above purpose has ceased or has recently met with little willingness. The news in question probably owes its origin to the generous donations of Wißmann's Hamburg friends, who subscribed and paid 80000 marks in one day. With this sum, the shipbuilding costs were secured and the steamer could be put to work. However, considerably larger sums were required to bring it to the site and launch it on the Viktoria Nyanza. The cost estimate is roughly as follows: construction costs loco Hamburg 77,000 Marks, transportation on a mail steamer to Saadani (including the European personnel to be carried 16,000 Carrier costs from Saadani to Viktoria. 180000 Total 273,000 marks. The carrier's wages are estimated at ¼ rupee - 40 pfennigs (to be handed over in cloth), calculated per day and per head. The weight of the steamer, including the spare parts, is rc. 100 tons - 100,000 kilograms. If one calculates around 30 kilograms per carrier, this results in a requirement of around 3400 carriers, according to experience for around 4 months or 120 days. Thus 3400 "c 40 "" 120 16 320000 Pfennig - 163 200 Marks would be the final result. However, there is also an additional requirement for reserve crews and for double loads of heavy iron parts, which may not exceed 40 to 50 kilograms.
Around 115,000 marks have so far been received in cash to cover this cost estimate. The African Association of German Catholics has pledged 30,000 marks, and 35,000 marks have been subscribed in Cologne under the aegis of Privy Councillor of Commerce Langen, so that around 100,000 marks are still missing from the total requirement. In view of this situation, the German Colonial Society and all those interested in the development of German East Africa should be urged to do their utmost to promote the enterprise planned by Major von Wißmann, so that the land transportation of the steamer, which is to begin in July 1891, can be financially secured by then. The Catholic mission stations in Uganda and on the southern shore of Lake Victoria Nyanza will gain the greatest advantage from the establishment of steamship transportation on the lake. Furthermore, the success of Emin Pasha, who intends to work hand in hand with Wissmann in the areas around the lake, will depend on the implementation of the enterprise. In practical terms, a new sales channel would be opened up for the German textile industry if - as has already been announced - larger factories were to supply bales of cotton staple fabrics that are viable in East Africa. These would be used to pay the porters, and the German goods would thus be introduced into the interior of Africa in place of the Manchester goods that currently dominate the market there. The objections raised against the construction of the steamer (shallow water depth of the Victoria=Nyanza, shoals and banks) are invalidated by the fact that the steamer is built to the minimum draught (5½ feet unloaded and 6 feet loaded), which, in view of the strong storms blowing on the Viktoria and the resulting waves, has been declared permissible by experts The confident hope may be expressed that the German people will not abandon their declared favorite, the Reichskommissar Major von Wißmann, and will not let the great national enterprise planned by him fail because of money. Liebert, Major in the General Staff. Jum Eisenbahnban in German East Africa. Dr. Carl Peters has published an article in No. 47 of the "Deutsches Wochenblatt" on the above subject, which, as the question is becoming more urgent, we reproduce in extract, together with another argument by Consul Vohsen published in the "National-Zeitung", without taking a position on either view. Peters sets out two conditions for railroad construction in order to do justice to this trade policy task: 1. it must divert the flow of caravans as far as possible from those places where direct shipment to Europe finds natural obstacles and the temptation is therefore obvious to bring the caravan to the opposite Zanzibar for shipment. Of such places, Bagamoyo, which has no harbor but only a very poor rhede, and from which the entire caravan trade flowing in from the interior of the island has been shipped to Zanzibar since time immemorial, comes first and foremost into question; 2. the railroad construction must contain the main flow of caravan traffic inland in such a way that it only reaches the coast at the point where the railroad terminates and the sufficient facilities for direct shipment to Europe have been created Dr. Peters objects to the Bagamoyo-Dar es=es=Salaam railroad project, saying that he does not believe that an East African coastal railroad will be competitive with the sea traffic that connects Bagamoyo with Dar es=Salaam at the same time. One could travel from Bagamoyo to Dar es=Salaam by steamer in 4-5 hours. What interest could the trader have in bringing caravans, which had been traveling from the lakes to Bagamoyo for 2-3 months, to Dar es=es=Salaam on the expensive railroad, just so that they would arrive there a few hours earlier. It then continues: "But I fear that once he has his caravan in Bagamoyo, if Sansidar should become a free port, he will have no interest at all in bringing them to Dar es Salaam. He simply takes them on his dhow to Sanstbar, as is his wont, and the commercial purpose of the ironbabn enterprise loses its effect. On the other hand, such a railroad in no way interferes with the no less important purpose of the economic development of East Africa. The fact that the steam wagon rolls from Bagamovo to Dar=es=Salaam parallel to the Indian Ocean means that not one more piece of produce from Usukuma, not one more tree from Usagara will reach the coast, and no possibility of making the plantation business in the interior profitable will be created. All that remains unchanged by this railroad construction. For these reasons, I would consider it a

Page 313

mistake to start the German-East African railroad ventures with a coastal railroad from Bagamovo to Dar es Salaam. I have fewer reservations about a second project discussed in recent months; I am referring to the railroad from Tanga to Usambara and further inland. At least the main purpose of such undertakings is kept in mind here: the development of the hinterland. Such a railroad opens up the terrible Usambara and therefore always retains its importance for local purposes. But one would be mistaken if one were to assume that it could intervene in the great trade movements of East Africa. It would certainly be able to take over the Baringo trade, which today animates the Pangani-Kilimanjaro Strait. Unfortunately, however, the British are much closer to these areas with their railroad construction from Momdas and are certainly already drawing trade from there from Naivasha to Mombassa, so that the north is no longer an option for the German railroad. What remains is the breakthrough to Victoria=Nyanza. No one can say whether such a breakthrough is technically possible at all, as no one has yet explored the lands between Kilimanjaro and Lake Victoria. However, if it succeeds, the railroad company will again be in competition with the British for the Lake Victoria area, who also want to build there, and on the other hand will leave the Udjidji-Tabora trading area to the left, thus intervening only very slightly in the process of closing off Sanstbar. For this reason, I consider it questionable to start our railroad ventures with this Tanga Usambara project. For this start, it seems to me that only a plan that takes full account of the aspects set out can be considered: To capture the trade flow of East Africa in its main branch and thereby promise, if not immediate, at least rapid profitability; to direct this trade to a German port, from where it can be shipped directly, and thirdly, conversely, to open up the colony from the coast to plantation ventures in its very heart, namely in the fertile mountainous regions of Ukami, Ngurn and Usagara. This is the railroad project from Dar=es=Salaan initially as far as Farhani to the slopes of the Usagara mountains, from where a continuation, presumably with a small northern extension due to the difficulties of the terrain, to the high plateau of Ugoge is to be considered. Once this plateau has been reached, nothing stands in the way of continuing to the center of East African trade, Tabora, and beyond. From Dar=es=Salaam to Farbani there are no terrain difficulties at all. It is a distance of about 35 German miles. This distance is long enough to exclude any competition from the carrier traffic from Farhani to Vagamoyo, and thus will certainly take the entire caravan mass to the starting point, the German port of Dar=es Salaam, but on the other hand it is short enough not to be too expensive. If a secondary railroad is envisaged, the costs are estimated at 10,000,000 M., a sum that can be expected to yield a certain return very soon, even with the traffic currently using this road In the "National=Zeitung" of December 2 (No. 656), Mr. Vohsen opposes the view that the railroad is to decide the economic independence of German East Africa; the next decisive factor for the construction of the railroad in our German East African colony is not so much the question of transporting existing caravan products or timber and livestock, but the guidance of the natives to real mass production, as is given in peanut and sesame culture. The total caravan mass of East Africa is currently insufficient to provide transportation objects to even approximately cover the operating costs of the railroads. East Africa's total export of ivory has so far amounted to no more than 150,000 kilos in the best years. This would not be enough to build a railroad. The article then continues: "The plans that exist alongside Dr. Peters' project are for a coastal railroad between Bagamoyo and Dar=es=Salaam and for a railroad that would primarily run to the foot of the Usambara Mountains. As far as Dr. Peters' reasons against the Bagamoyo-Dar=es=Salaam railroad are concerned, I think it is above all wrong to compare this railroad of only 60 to 70 kilometers in length, which has the purpose of connecting a good port with the currently most important trading centre, with the project of an actual development railroad, which would have to run 300 kilometers to Farhani alone. But the reasons that Dr. Peters gives against the construction of this railroad do not seem valid to me either. For example, because of the difficulty of transportation between the capital of the French colony of Senegal. St. Louis, with the open sea, it was decided in 1882 to connect it with the port of Dakar by rail. This railroad was opened to traffic on July 6, 1885 with a length of 263 kilometers. Three tasks were sought and solved with this railroad; firstly, the desired connection with production centers was created, then the pacification of the country from a military point of view was achieved and the development of agriculture was promoted along the entire line. Traders have settled and prospered in all villages with a railroad station. Some villages have even become more important and form the center of small towns. At present, the average freight rate is 10 cents per 1000 kilograms and kilometer, for arachides, which are an exceptionally light product, 13 cents per kilometer and ton, and it is believed that this can still be reduced. For the 70-kilometer route Bagameyo - Dar=es=Salaam, the freight rate would amount to 6-8 marks per 1000 kilograms if the same tariff were introduced, while the German-East African steamship line does not carry 1000 kilograms for less than 10 marks for the same route. In the case of shipping, there are also the expensive landing and shipping costs, which are not incurred by the railroad. The success of this railroad depends solely on the fact that it is cheaply produced and that the operating costs are limited to the bare minimum. One must choose light material and take into account that heavy and expensive material spoils just as quickly as light and cheap material. It must be possible to replace the material constantly without incurring excessive costs. The Dar=es=Salaam=Farbani, Tabora, Udschidschi project of Dr. Peters, the actual development line with its grandiose conception, can only be juxtaposed with the Tanga=Usambara=KilimanjaroViktoria=Nyanza project and possibly Tanganvika. Let us first compare the two projects with regard to the tasks they set themselves in terms of overcoming the distances. The minimum distances to be covered as the crow flies are as follows: Dar=es=Salaam=Tanganvika: Dar=es=Salaam=Farhani 270 Km. Farhani=Tabora Tabora=Ujijiji 315 together 1085 km. Tanga=Viktoria=Nyanza: Tanga=Iliambara 100 Km. Usambara=Kilimanjaro Kilimanjaro influence Rubana into the Speke Gulf together 675 km. Difference in favor of the Victoria=Nyanza project a shortening of the line by 410 km. It is unknown how far the Rubana is navigable and there is at least the possibility that the line to the Victoria-Nyanza could be shortened even further by terminating at the most navigable point of the Rubana. However, if this project were to be accompanied by the development of the Tanganyika, the distance from the south-west end of the Victoria Nyanza to the north-west end of the Tanganyika would only be 300 km and instead of one lake area, two would be developed with a shorter distance of 110 km. The west bank of the Victoria=Nyanza, namely Karagwe, has been described to us by Dr. Peters. Stanley and Emin Pasha as an extremely rich and fertile country, and if anywhere, one might hope to be able to intervene in the great trade movements of East Africa. Due to the absence of rivers flowing far into the interior, the construction of a railroad is the only means of facilitating transport and traffic. In political terms, it is the only means of governing the country, establishing peace and security and thus laying the foundations for wealth. From the economic point of view, it is also the only means of preventing the diversion of trade from the interior, and perhaps also the emigration of the natives, on the one hand to the English colonies, if the English company carries out its project of building a railroad to the Victoria of Momdas, and on the other hand to the Congo, which offers an excellent route for exploitation to the west, a route which will soon be uninterrupted by the completion of the railroad from Matadi to Stanley=Pool. If these two immense routes, the railroad of the English and the river route of the Belgians, are opened, and if we remain inactive, it is to be feared that the greater part of the trade of Central Africa will fall into the hands of these nations, if we do not take vigorous action ourselves. But if we proceed as the above proposal implies, we have a great chance of success, for at the same rate the Arabs of Jnner and other traders will prefer to come to the German East African coast, where their family, their property, their social and religious home is located. Certainly the costs of marriage will be very high, but they are not an insurmountable obstacle. From the coast to the Victoria=Nyanza there are about 700 kilometers to cover, at 12 Pf. per 1000 kg. and kilometer the 100 kg. and kilometer would cost about 8 Marks in Trankport. Many products of lower value would not be able to bear these costs. The rich products and goods of value, however, can bear significantly higher freight rates. Ivory could certainly carry 1000 marks for 1000 ko., rubber 2-300 marks per 1000 ko. Similarly, the sought-after European goods can pay higher freight rates, so that the tariff could be lowered for the low-value products and thus make them exportable. In addition, there would be the intermediate traffic and the transportation of passengers and large caravans coming from the interior, which would certainly use the railroad for a large part of their journey. In order to counter the objection that the route between Kilimanjaro and Victoria Nyanza is likely to encounter great local difficulties, it should also be noted that Mr. Lieutenant Höhnel. Count Teleki's companion, believes from his experience that the route is largely covered with jungle and that no major obstacles are to be expected. As willing as the German cavalry may be to make sacrifices, it is not to be expected that the means to carry out such a large project as the realization of a railroad to Victoria Nyanza and Tanganvika will be found without the support of the government, and in my opinion this is justified, In view of the great general importance of the undertaking, I believe that our government is justified in requesting that a guarantee of a minimum annual income be granted to a German consortium taking over the construction of this railroad to enable the development of central Sudan to the German East African coast. According to existing agreements in French West Africa, this guarantee for the Tanga=Viktoria Nyanza railroad should not exceed 700,000 marks.

Tobacco cultivation in Deli. The work by de Haarsmal) on the cultivation of tobacco in Sumatra, already announced in the previous issue, which can be regarded as a kind of encyclopaedia of this plantation business in general, is so important in its nature and so instructive for many people who are relatively unfamiliar with tropical cultures that it is recommended that the various tasks associated with tobacco cultivation, the establishment of such a plantation, the workers required for it and the processing of the product be dealt with in more detail. Even if each tropical country requires a special tobacco culture and the scheme of Sumatra planting has to be changed accordingly, it is easy to find out what is common and of lasting value for tobacco growing in general. The book begins with a chapter on the general requirements for the education of a tobacco planter, which can be limited to those of a good modern school education, strong physical constitution, firm will and sound natural mind, which are often enough found in connection with the age of 22 to 25 years in Germany. But it is wrong to send young people to India directly from grammar school or secondary school, as the later position already presupposes a certain journey of character and judgment. Those who have experienced a practical sphere of activity in the agricultural field will on average be preferred, but an unfortunate career will not serve as a recommendation there any more than elsewhere. It is very useful to acquire some knowledge of Malay and Chinese in Europe, for which the German has a good opportunity at the Oriental seminary, while until recently, strangely enough, there was no institute in Holland where the prospective planter could familiarize himself with these languages, for the working material is very mixed, there are Chinese, Javanese, Boyans, Malayans, Batakkers, Bengalese and Siamese, whose different customs and habits it becomes necessary to get to know in the course of time. Very strange in some respects, but necessary with regard to the workers, is the peculiar caste division of the Chinese workers. At the head of the workers is a main tandil, the right-hand man of the company's administrator and consequently one of the highest authorities. He ensures that the orders given by the administrator and the assistants are carried out properly, investigates all differences between coolies, tandils and assistants, decides all minor Chinese issues and is, in a word, a very important personality. Below him are the Tandils, Javanese Mandur, who are the so-called route chiefs of the individual groups of Chinese coolies. They are usually elected by the coolies themselves, but enjoy many pecuniary advantages and are of course indispensable as supervisors. In addition to these tandils, who are used more for field work, there is also the sorting tandil or the tandil of the fermentation barn, who is in charge of the stacking and sorting of the tobacco in the fermentation barn. Sorting is, as we would like to point out at the outset, one of the most important jobs, although the workers are given the not exactly flattering name of "stinkers". This ugly name has already become an official one, which is given to every coolie who is less skilled and not strong enough for field work. In addition to the Chinese, who make up the majority, there are also Javanese who live in their own kampongs, as well as Tamils, emigrants from Madras, who are particularly good for earthwork and as cattle herders, but are by no means suitable for work in the tobacco fields, which is intensive. The Boyans, the English name for the inhabitants of the island of Bawean, mostly come from Singapore and are Muslim men who are used to build houses and barns. The Batakkers, the indigenous people of the independent interior of Sumatra, come second in terms of labor, as do the inhabitants of the east coast of Sumatra. We will pass over the various facilities of the plantations, guardhouses, stores, stables, hospitals, sheds, comptoirs, etc., in order to come to the establishment of a plantation. When opening a business, the value of the location is of course of great importance, both in terms of the soil and the central location and the possibility of drainage and shipping. For a found, viable enterprise in Sumatra, it is necessary to have about 4000 buildings on land and soil.
(one building can be assumed to be 7,100 square meters). The land allotted to each kuli, including the paths, has an extent of 10 depa in width and 100 depa in depth, the depa being calculated at 6 English feet or about 1.82 meters. Each field, after deducting all the paths and buildings, the barns, the bollard dwellings, the assistants' houses, etc., has not much more surface than 1500 English fathoms, which value is taken by the planter as a depa, so that a field can be estimated at about ¾ building. About 200 trenches of virgin soil can be taken into use per year by an administrator, but it is advisable not to tackle more than 75 trenches in the first year. The paths are cut through the forest, the trees are felled, the water drainage is regulated, the fields are measured and distributed, the assistant's dwelling is built in a well-situated place together with the drying barns and the coolies' houses before planting can be considered. This activity begins towards the end of December, in January or early February. (In New Guinea it has also turned out that a later start to planting is not feasible after it was discovered that the relationship between the rainy and dry seasons in the northern part of the country is roughly the same as on the east coast of Sumatra). The coolies are grouped together, given their tools, move into their new homes and settle in peacefully. While the fields are being properly cleaned and ploughed, the coolie prepares his seedbed on a piece of land which he has properly tilled with the tjankul, a tool used to dig the soil, usually in the evening by moonlight. Meanwhile, the assistant has distributed the tobacco seeds to the individual tandils, who plant the seeds with the utmost care in the specially worked soil. When the seedbed is in order, it is protected by a roof of alang (tall grass). When the seed has emerged, the seedlings (bibit) are pulled out with the soil for planting and planted in the evening in the prepared planting holes on the beds measured out for this purpose. On the same evening the plant is protected from the sun by shade sticks, thin sticks about 8 inches long and 4-5 inches wide, which are inserted so that only the morning sun can shine on the shady side, the midday sun falls at most on the upper surface of the plant, while the hot afternoon rays cannot reach it at all. The cultivator must now check every morning to make sure that there are no worms and other insects on his young plants and always remove them, water the plants occasionally, move the shade wood and pile up the soil around the plant until the shade wood can be dispensed with after about two weeks. But during this time the cultivator has other work to do, some plants degenerate or become sickly and have to be removed, others have to be operated on if they swell and become sickly due to a worm, in short, this is where the intensive work of the cultivators begins, which makes it questionable whether the same can ever be achieved with Bantunegers. Three times the plants have to be mounded and drained and freed from all parasites until they have reached a height where the topping, the removal of the flower bud, can begin. In order to prevent the tobacco plant, the "tobacco tree", from growing higher and to bring it to a suitable stage of development, the crown is broken out to the extent that about 15 to 20 leaves remain on the plant. During this time, the plant is very much infested with parasites and the culi has to do its reading work carefully every morning. The plant now begins to mature, the uppermost leaves turn yellow and the tobacco is ready for cutting 60 to 90 days after planting. In the past, the assistant has made sure that each barn has a middle path where the coolies can bring their carefully dried tobacco directly to the drying barn. Each barn has a pen as a guard. The assistant usually gives each coolie a small book in which his name, number and the name of his tandil are entered. In this book, the assistant records the date, how many trees, of which variety and at what price, are carried into the barn. The tobacco trees are cut on warm days when they are completely dry, usually at midday, and a good Kuli delivers an average of 250 trees a day. The cut tobacco is also sorted and hung up in the barn. This hanging of the tobacco is of the greatest importance for the entrepreneurs, as many leaves are broken and destroyed by rough handling. The assistant now has a number of important functions during the drying of the tobacco; he must ensure that no damp vapors penetrate through the hatches, but as much light and air as possible, and occasionally light feners in the barns on wet days.

Page 315

Meanwhile, the work of the coolies continues; they are intent on the second cut, i.e. to plant a new tadak tree on the cut stalk, although this variety is of less value. After 28 to 30 days, the first tobacco, which has been brought to the drying chafers, will be dry enough to be "rimmed", i.e. the leaves can be plucked from the stem. The tandil now has his coolies arrange the necessary sticks of bamboo about 2 feet long, which are important for sorting. The kuli strips the dry leaves from the tree and by hammering four of the sticks into the ground in the shape of a half bow, he obtains compartments into which the tobacco leaves can be laid according to variety. When the compartments are almost full, the pen begins to bunch the tobacco, i.e. to take 50 leaves from one compartment and tie them together at the ends with a tobacco rope. When enough tobacco has been bundled in this way, the tandil begins to receive it, checks it, counts the bundles and sorts them into base and top leaves. They are then carefully stacked a few rows high on a special rack or immediately placed in the tobacco baskets, which contain 200 to 250 bundles. The tobacco is then collected from the drying kilns with ox carts, which are completely protected from rain and sun, and taken to the fermentation kilns, where it is weighed and counted so that no errors occur in the calculations with the coolies. The main purpose of the fermentation process is to evaporate the water vapors in the leaves by slow fermentation and thus make the tobacco suitable for the European market without the risk of rotting on the way, but also to give the tobacco the necessary firm color and luster. The quality tobacco is usually stacked on low benches at a height of 4 to 5 feet. As soon as a pile has reached half its height, a hollowed-out bamboo is placed in it, which contains a thermometer divided into centigrades; however, the procedure varies according to the different varieties and this work must be carried out with the utmost care. The stacks are occasionally swept when they have reached a heat of 38°, regularly inspected and, depending on how much water they have lost, stacked up again in different ways until, after about three or four weeks, the actual sorting can begin. The whole floor is covered with plates, while the sorter places his tobacco between the stalks, which indicate the variety in Chinese characters, European and Malay letters. In many companies, nineteen brands are distinguished, starting with "dark" and ending with "sweepings", short tobacco, not suitable for the European market. The sorter opens the leaves well, ensures that they do not break, and places them in the various trays, from which the tuft maker takes them, bundles them and hands them over to the tandils, who check the finished tobacco once again for length, color and processing. The tobacco received is now placed in piles, usually of 30 bundles, and placed in larger stacks so that it can be properly re-fermented while the sorting is still in full swing. The stacks are usually 16 to 18 feet wide with a front length of 18 to 22 feet and a height of 9 to 12 feet, while they often remain standing for six weeks and develop a heat of up to about 70 degrees. At this stage, the accounts of the coolies are settled, but the work does not end there, only now does the sorting for the European market begin. While leaves of one variety were combined into bundles during the previous processing, bundles of tobacco of the same variety are now brought together. The recipient, or rather now the sorters, sit on the bench where the necessary bundles are brought to them by the carriers; they pick them up one by one, inspect them and throw them where they think they belong. In order not to lose too much space in the fermentation barn, the piece leaf is usually first pressed into bales as soon as it has been sorted, in which form the tobacco is brought to the European market. For this purpose, the tobacco is first weighed in baskets of 80 kilos, pressed and packed in mats and is then ready for shipment. We have only been able to give an outline of the work on such a plantation, but it is clear what painstaking and meticulous work falls to the assistants in particular, and that this work is not easy in a tropical climate. However, a glance at the huge growth in Amsterdam's trade shows that the money and effort expended are extremely worthwhile. In 1864, 50 packs were sold at an average price of 48 cents a pound, worth 5,000 guilders, in 1881 (114 packs at an average price of 129 cents, i.e. for about 33,128,000 guilders. The most superficial consideration shows what an endless chain of important circumstances, which had a profound impact on the economic life of the Netherlands, are linked to these sums, which have risen to enormous heights in the last ten years. If the colonial budget of the Netherlands shows a deficit, what does this mean compared to the vast sums that have flowed to Holland through the tobacco ban alone, compared to the thousands of newly created employment opportunities, compared to the winners of the shipping industry, merchants, brokers, etc., who have only achieved prosperity and wealth through the huge tobacco production of Sumatra. Laws of status and inheritance in the Marshall Islands. Some reports on the law of status and the law of succession in the Marshall Islands contradict each other in a not insignificant way. The subject seems interesting enough to us to bear a detailed discussion. According to Chamisso, the inheritance passes from the eldest brother to the next eldest, and when the youngest brother has finally died, he is succeeded by a son of the deceased eldest brother; this statement is also accepted by Waitz and Meinicke, but is questionable. Hernsheim speaks of a female inheritance to the younger brother, and Hellwald also does not consider this to be proven. On the contrary, Consul Knappe reports that a succession to the younger brother only takes place if he is considered particularly suitable, that as a rule the eldest son of the eldest sister and never his own son succeeds the deceased - and thus, as we can add with certainty, never a brother's son. This is all the more splendid as this order of succession to the throne corresponds perfectly with that observed among all other peoples of the same language and culture. For the same right also exists among the Palau (Semper), Bay (Chamisso), Mortlock (Hellwald), Ponave (Waitz), the Mariannen (Freyeinet) and a number of unrelated peoples. Chamisso's statements can easily be traced back to a misunderstanding when we see how in the closely related Kingsmill language (we have no direct evidence about the Marsdallians themselves, but can assume that it is the same here) the word naru is used without distinction for one's own children, the brother's children and the sister's children, indeed that even the children of cousins and confines in the most distant degrees are designated by the same word. If it depends on whether the child is a son or a daughter, one says natu-ti-mani, or my male child, and natu-ti-eini, or my female child. Now we know well that the Kingsmill Islanders can say: my father's brother, and my mother's brother, but they very seldom make use of this paraphrase, which is not in the spirit of their language, and if someone now wanted to say in this sense: my sister's son, or my brother's son, a new difficulty arises which makes understanding more difficult for the European: for the word tarn bites when a man says: "my brother", and when a woman says: "my sister". Edenso is monn when a man says: "my sister" and when a woman says: "my brother". If one now considers that the Kogebue expedition on which Chamisso was on did not stay long to experience a fall from the throne, that the scholars were only dependent on the oral statements of the natives, that they were together for months with one of the natives, Kadu, who accompanied them. But that Kadu originally came from the Carolines, and that mutual understanding was made very difficult by the lack of grammars, aids and preparatory work of all kinds, and that at that time not the least was known of the succession to the throne of the sister Odnes in Europe, and that the agnatic succession was taken for granted, one will believe that even the most careful researcher has made a misunderstanding. If we now assume that the kinship words of the Kingsmill (Gilbert) and the Marfhall Islands do not show an essential difference in their system (and this we can, as I said, do without hesitation), then even at Chamisso's and Kogebne's time, just as Knappe indicates today, a man would have been buried by his brother, or his sister's son, a woman by her own children. In any case, however, all observers agree that only blood relatives were called to inherit, not mere in-laws. Now Bartholomäus von Werner, in his otherwise excellent and very readable book "Ein Deutsches Kriegsschiff in der Südsee" (p. 366), teaches us the following intricate case of inheritance: a former king had taken away the wife of a minor chief Kabua=Lebon, made her his main wife and received a Sodn (Nelu=Letabalin) from her. After the death of the former king, the wife had returned to her first husband, Kabua Lebon, and this had elevated the latter to such an extent that he had become king; after his death he would not be buried by his own son, but by his stepson No=Letabalin. The latter was about 17 years old in 1879, according to the anonymous report in the "Deutsche Kolonialzeitung 1886 p. 789, 720, which first states that there are four estates in the Marshall Islands, lrolj (irod, iroidh, irus) the highest, - burak (budag)lastake take (leadagedag. leotakatak. läateketak) - and armidwon (dajur, armykajur, kadjur) the common people. In this and in the statement that the estate is inherited strictly from mother to children, the report agrees completely with Knappe and with the sources of Hellwald, Meinicke and Waiß=Gerland, while Hernsheim assumes only three estates, and regards the irod (which word he translates as king) as a member of the budag; similarly, the whole royal family belongs to the budag.

Page 316

 Hernsheim thus agrees with Werner that there is a real kingship on Ralik, a statement that is difficult to reconcile with Chamisso's descriptions of Ratak and also with the further statements of the unnamed in the "1.D. Kolonialzig." For we also learn that greater powers are not associated with the higher rank per se and that the higher chief does not exercise rule over the lower one, that power and prestige are rather only conferred by the size of the landed property. We further learn that Lebon=Kabna belongs to the first class (the Jroij) and Nelu to the second class (the Burak). Here a contradiction with Werner becomes apparent. If Lebon=Kabua himself is a Jrois and has not acquired the rank of such only later, then no one has been able to take his first wife away from him, for this is a right which all nobles have against the people and the noble classes among themselves, but to all appearances this right belongs to the higher classes only against the lower classes by virtue of their higher rank, but not to the richer and more influential against the poorer, although the sources (Werner, Kriegsschiff in der Südsee, p. 366; - Knappe in the Mitteilungen aus den deutschen Schutzgebieten l., p. 76; - Hernsheim, SüdseeErinnerungen, p. 81) do not, unfortunately, make a definite statement on this question. So if Lebon=Kabna had his wife taken away earlier, then either he was not a Jroij, or, contrary to what one would like to infer from the reports, the right to take away wives is not linked to higher rank, but to greater influence. It is of course true that one can become a Jroif without being born as such, namely if a lesser man marries a Jroij= woman. But this is out of the question for the Lebon=Kabua, at least as far as his marriage to the mother of Nelu Letadalin is concerned, because, firstly, Kabua would already have become a Jroij by virtue of his first marriage to this woman, not only through the marriage back, and secondly, this woman was not even in a position to confer the Jroij dignity on Kabua, because the qu. We can infer this from the fact that, according to the report of the unnamed man, her son No=Letabalin is a Burak, for the son always has the rank of his mother, not his father, and we therefore do not know what rank the so-called deceased king of Werner could have had. In the report of the unnamed it is further stated that the alleged King Kadua does not remotely deserve this designation as an attribute of supreme power, that he has a certain personal influence on some islands, in particular because he is the stepfather of Nelu=Letabalin, and that the latter has large estates on several islands; but since Nelu=Letabalin himself has grown up (he was already 24 years old in 1886), the personal influence of Lebon=Kadua has also greatly diminished. This all sounds more credible than Werner's statement. The inheritance of a right from the deceased to the later husband of his widow is as improbable as possible. However, it is plausible that Lebon, who already had some landed property and through his marriage to the widow also obtained the actual disposal of his stepson's property (there are no guardianships and guardianship controls on the Marshall Islands), thereby acquired a great deal of personal influence, just as the "deceased king" had the actual disposal of his son Rein's property in addition to his own property and apparently based his influence on this. For the property of the deceased king did not pass to Nelu, but to brothers or sisters-in-law of the deceased, and the property of Nelu did not come from the deceased king, but from his mother's brother. I therefore assume the following: The old king had his own landed property and at the same time the actual disposal of the landed property that little Nelu had inherited from a mother brother, and through this he had the greatest influence on Ralik. After his death, the property was divided; his own estate passed to his sister's son or a brother, and Nelu's property came under the actual disposal of Lebon by the widow's hand, who became the most powerful man before Ralik by virtue of this disposition and his own landed property. If he does not lose this influence immediately after Nelu's great age, but only gradually, this is for three reasons: firstly, because, as Werner and Hernsheim undoubtedly show, he is a very intelligent and courageous man (and this will certainly do much to maintain his actual influence), secondly, because the Germans have always negotiated with him in the first place, and thirdly, because Neln cannot replace him entirely, for Neln has only his own property and has neither acquired nor can ever expect to acquire legal or de facto rule over Lebon=Kabua's property. When Lebon dies, his brother Lagadjimi will probably be the heir to his property; He will also have no influence over Neiu and the latter will thus become the undisputed first chief of Ralik. Incidentally, Werner took the precaution never to negotiate with Lebon=Kabna alone, but always consulted Nelu-Letabalin and, immediately after the treaty with Lebon and Nelu on Jaluit was concluded, asked the chiefs on Ebon to join, so that Werner's possible jrrium should not have harmed the binding nature of the treaty.*) Breslau.

Communications from the Society. We are pleased to announce that we will have to increase the circulation of our Society's journal considerably next year, as the number of new members joining our Society this year significantly exceeds the number of members leaving. (New sections) were formed in Kiel, Oberhausen i Rheinl. and Celle. In Gelle, the following gentlemen have taken over the business of the board: Mr. Westrum, lawyer (l. chairman), Mr. Huesker II, medical officer (chairman), Mr. Mitzlaff, pharmacist (secretary). Detailed information is still awaited from Kiel and Oberhausen. We would like to take this opportunity to thank the gentlemen who have supported the Central Office in its efforts. On November 24, Privatdozent Dr. Bornhak spoke at the Berlin branch of the German Colonial Society on the legal status of the German protectorates, beginning with a historical account of the fact that the system of administration of the protectorates inaugurated by Prince Bismarck had proved to be impracticable. Accordingly, the administration was again to be handled directly by the Reich. The protectorates had only become integral parts of the German Empire in terms of international law, as they had not been incorporated by imperial law and were therefore foreign countries under constitutional law. However, the protectorates are inseparably linked to the empire by real union. After an overview of the Emperor's right to issue ordinances, the administration of the individual colonies, the Colonial Department and the Colonial Council, he discussed in particular the judicial relations existing in the colonies. The great majority of the natives were under the jurisdiction of the native chiefs, while only a small minority of whites were under German jurisdiction. The indigenous powers are directly under the empire and form only a kind of patrimonial jurisdiction. A uniform higher court for legal disputes was still lacking and for more important matters an appeal to the Imperial Court had to be permitted so that the unity of law between the mother country and the colonies would not be interrupted. Minor announcements. - (His Majesty the Emperor) has had the sum of 3000 marks allocated for the construction of the steamer projected by Wißmann and has also confirmed his interest in the enterprise in this way. - The exploitation and lurking development of the lake area is becoming increasingly urgent, as the English are very active in this area, and the last letters from Emin Pasha have certainly contributed to redirecting the Germans' attention to the cultural mission awaiting them. These letters were largely received favorably, although there was no lack of commentary. One opinion even went so far as to construct a certain opposition between Emin and Wißmann. In contrast, we can only emphasize that such a contrast does not exist and has never existed. It is not always necessary to emphasize purely personal motives in the actions of our great Africa experts. If Emin Pasha wants to become governor of a newly created province, which no one will blame him for, it does not follow that this would disrupt Wissmann's plans East Africa is so large that these two excellent men should have a place next to each other. - Reichskommissar v. Wißmann and the civil commissioner Herr o. Soden paid a visit to the Sultan of Zanzibar on December 3. Mr. v. Soden and the former deputy Reich Commissioner Dr. Schmidt have left for Europe. Major v. Wißmann intends to embark on a journey to inspect the coastal areas immediately after his arrival. - Dar=es=Salaam is definitely designated as the seat of the governorate. - According to the Kreuzzeitung, Kurt Toeppen has been appointed Dolmeischer to the Reichskommissar at the request of Consul General Dr. Michahelles. - Emin Pasha arrived safe and sound in Usonge on September 7 and, according to the latest news, docked at the Westuser of the Victoria Station. - (On the organization of the customs administration in East Africa). After, as has been reported elsewhere, orders have already been issued to East Africa by the Reich, according to which from January 1 next year, the date on which the customs administration will be handed over to the Reich, resp. In view of the fact that from January 1 next year, the date on which the customs administration is to be transferred to the Reich, or rather when it will be managed for the Reich's account, imports and exports are to be strictly restricted to certain routes and places and thus the previously uncontrollable entrances and exits to the country are to be closed off, it may be timely to point out how necessary it is to limit the traffic centers that must be created to only a few and actual port places and to open up further places for free trade only after an absolute need has been established. In particular, it should be borne in mind that after the conclusion of the Anglo-German treaty, Sanstbar, which until then had been the center of transport and trade in German East Africa, was forcibly torn away from the Denian area, we are virtually forced to make this separation from Sansidar less noticeable by creating new traffic centers on the coast. Bagamoyo, which was created in the future with Sanstbar as a traffic center for receiving the caravan trade, would above all have to cease to belong to the number of harbors opened to free traffic and would have to be relegated to the Meinicke, Inseln des stillen Ozeans 2, p. 339.

be restricted to inter-colonial traffic. After the separation of Zanzibar from our coast, Bagamoyo no longer has any right to exist for us. From the moment that Zanzibar was separated from the German possession, the separation of Bagamvaro from Zanzibar is necessary for us and the customs organization gives us a hand in this. Bagamoyo's import and export trade must be routed via the new traffic centers to be created on the coast, and this will be done by making Bagamoyo a wine station and restricting it to inter-colonial traffic. It would be desirable if this aspect were taken into account in the reorganization of the customs administration on the German East African coast. (The Federal Council has received the draft of a law concerning the East African troops for German East Africa. The third chapter contains the regulations on formation, limitation and legal suspicions, Il the supply and III transitional provisions Reichsanzeiger comments on this ordinance: In particular, the criminal and disciplinary circumstances, as well as the supply system, come into consideration. Finally, the urgent need has become apparent to have the administration of the troops carried out by trained officials with independent responsibility. This transformation can no longer be postponed and can take place independently of the question of whether the need for a protection force is to be regarded as permanent or not, and whether the conditions in East Africa permit a reduction in the present number of troops or not. At present, these suspicions are still in a state of flux. They therefore only have a decisive influence on the way in which the planned measure is carried out to the extent that their incompleteness makes it necessary to shape the framework for the new organization in such a flexible way that it can easily adapt to changes in circumstances. A second point of view for the reorganization to be undertaken arises from the consideration that, in the interest of strengthening the moral element in the Schutztruppe, it appears necessary to place the German members of it on the same level as the members of the military power of the Reich. The most effective means of giving the former a feeling of equal responsibility and of the equal value of their position, insofar as this can be achieved by organizational measures, is to bring the German members of the Schutztruppe into an organic connection with the military power of the Reich. . . . . (To the honour of Dr. Karl Peters), a large celebration was held in the Pbildarmonie on December 5. The two original flags of the German Emin Pasha expedition were hoisted on the orchestra podium, on which the Emperor's bust was emblazoned, and weapons trophies captured by Peters surrounded the flags. The German Emin Pasha Committee was represented by Minister v. Hofmann and many members. The presence of an English Africa researcher, Dr. Felkin from Edinburgh, who traveled to Africa at the end of the 1970s and also met Emin Pasha, was of particular interest. Dr. Peters was given a lively welcome when he appeared. After the emperor's speech by stud. jur. Reichelt, cond. jur. Andrege took the floor to give a speech in which he praised Peters as the pioneer of the national idea. Dr. Peters then took the floor to lively applause in order to express his conviction that all national movements would find their main focus in the youth, expressing his gratitude for the orations he had received. He followed this with the news that Emin Pasha had just arrived at Victoria in the region where he had achieved his great successes. In a fascinating speech, he then described the experiences of his expedition and the fundamentally different characters of Emin and Stanley. He concluded his almost hour-long speech with a toast to the Association of German Students. After Reierendar Held had dedicated a salamander to the old fighter for colonial policy, Dr. Felkin from Edinburgh took the floor to pay tribute to Peter's admiration and to describe his first meeting with Emin in 1878. "I know," he remarked, among other things, "that Emin is a bit strange, you have to know how to deal with him. I did not know at first that he was a German at all, but I saw that he was a highly educated man and a loyal friend, who certainly did everything possible to lift people into civilization. I am convinced that if Hülle had come, he would have held the province; I do not know what he wants to do now, but I know that Emin will fight for civilization to the end and that he will succeed in doing great things in Africa." The Englishman's words met with a lively response. Lieutenant-Captain Rust toasted Minister of State v. Hofmann, who toasted the well-being of the colonial-minded German Zugend. No. 2474 of the Leinzige Illustrirte Zeitung of November 29 (about the catastrophes of Witu) contains a lengthy and interesting original report by August Meuschel, a member of the Künz=lsche Expedition, along with several illustrations based on his sketches. (The third volume of the German colonial calendar published by L. von Trautvetter, Berlin, which has just appeared, contains, in addition to a history of the individual colonies during the past year, lists of the imperial authorities in the protectorates, the colonial acquisition companies, the agitation companies, the missions in the colonies and the post steamship connections with details of passenger and freight tariffs, some interesting statistical material and a literary overview. Among the illustrative decorations, we highlight the pictures "Exerzierplatz in Dar=es=Salaam" and "Gefangene Sklavenräuber im Hof des Forts von Bagamovo" by Mr. von Eckenbrecher, which are based on original photographs. As the material is as antbent as possible, the booklet is recommended for anyone who wants to inform themselves quickly about the state of the colonial movement.
(Nachrus.) On the part of the committee that supported the Künzel enterprise in Witn, we have received the following appeal for printing: In the days of September 15-17, 1890, the following played in Witulande, which has recently come under English rule: Andreas Küngel from Eppenreuth (Bavaria), Friedrich Stauf from Siegen (Westphalia), Josef Drotles from Hermannstadt (Transylvania), Josef Urbau from Brüntbal (Upper Bavaria). Johannes Claus from Nymwegen, Josef Jazwiecki from Szarley (Prussia), Fritz Horn from Neustadt a. d. H., Carl Horn from Neustadt a. d. H., Rodert Behucke from Hobendorf d. Reichenbach (East Prussia) fell victim to the last political upheavals. Working as pioneers for German interests here, they soon succeeded in gaining the respect and friendship of their colleagues through diligence and energy. Their death is a great loss for all those who had the opportunity to get to know them here and to observe them in their work, a loss that is especially hard to mourn in the interests of the German cause. Küntzel, the head of the company, as well as his loyal companions, will always be remembered with honor by all of us. Lamu, East Africa, October 1890, E. v. Carnap=Quernheimb. Gustav Denbardt. A.

Tost. - (From the western border of the German Togo territory) the "Nationalztg." receives a lengthy letter dated October from the English Gold Coast, in which it is explained that since January 1 of this year the English governor has struck a heavy blow against trade in the Togo territory. While on the Gold Coast, i.e. on the right western bank of the Volt, a duty of 10 percent of the net value is levied on almost all imported goods, on the left eastern bank of the Volt most goods can be imported tax-free or are only subject to a very low duty. The actual customs border of the Gold Coast colony thus runs along the Volta, on the right bank. This measure is aimed at the German Togo region and the trade there. It is intended to induce traders from the interior to bring their goods not to Togo, but to the English part of the Slave Coast on the left bank of the Volta, where they can buy European goods almost duty-free and therefore "considerably cheaper than in Lome, Klein=Popo, Porto Novo rc. These measures naturally entailed lengthy customs hassles, which necessitated a large contingent of tax officials. Household soldiers are stationed along the entire western bank of the Volia. They do not, however, confine themselves to preventing smuggling from German territory, but in their eagerness they even cross over into German territory, stop the traders making their way there, beat them and rob them of their goods if it turns out that they have not bought them in the English part of the Slave Coast. They also harass the pro-German chiefs and incite the anti-German chiefs to forcibly divert trade to the right bank of the Volta River. According to reports in the "Natzig.", some of these high-spirited patrons are said to have been caught by the German authorities and are behind bars in Klein=Popo, where they are not being treated too lightly -- (The British=South African Company), which is known to have moved from Betschuanaland to Matabeland, has been fortunate in that it was neither harassed by the invaders nor had to overcome particularly difficult natural obstacles. According to the latest reports, the settlement on Mount Hampden, which had previously been considered, was abandoned due to the difficult water conditions there, and Fort Salisbury was built a little further south. It lies 4900 feet above sea level in a healthy and fertile area, approximately at 17° 54 south latitude and 31020* east longitude. After the fort was built, the English prospectors (about 300) dispersed in all directions, but especially to the upper Mazon river, where gold had been found earlier, and to the well-known gold districts of Maschenaland. It soon became apparent that gold was present in all these districts, daily applications were received at Fort Salisbury to register the claims according to the mining laws of the company, While in this part of Mashonaland the gold occurs as so-called reef gold, large alluvial goldfields have recently been discovered in the northern region, on the Umfuli, a tributary of the Zambezi, and the representatives of the syndicates and private individuals have since set out to undertake the difficult march there. The railroad goes beyond Kimberiey to Bryburg, but then there are still a few hundred English miles to be traversed, of which about 400 are supposed to be passable on a new road laid out by the Legation. It is obvious that the English in Mashonaland will soon seek another communication with the coast, and that the stipulation of the English-Portuguese agreement, according to which the English have the right to build a railroad along the Pungwe to Solala, will be realized in a short time, It is high time that the two governments reached an agreement, for otherwise there will be more bloody conflicts in South Africa between the Third East African Company, which is acting with the boldness of real privateers, and the Portuguese, whose property is under threat, than we have already had. The Peringgies have recaptured Mutassa, which the English took from them against all pretense and right (it lies close to Majsilesse, where the Portuguese officer Andrade is stationed with a troop), but according to the latest reports they have lost it again to the English. 4 The most important thing is that, apart from all other Portuguese claims, the territory of Mutassa still undoubtedly falls within Portuguese territory according to the Portuguese-English agreement.

 Literature. The Jahin=language of the Finschhafen area (N.=O. New=Guinea Kaiser=Wilhelmsland). By Dr. O. Schellong. Reviewed by Dr. H. Schnorr von Carolsfeld. Leipzig 1890. published by Wilhelm Friedrich. 128 S. 8° It is very much to be hoped that this commendable work will inspire many of our compatriots in the South Seas to undertake similar research, so that the darkness which still generally hangs over the Papuan languages may be more and more cleared up, so that clarity may be brought to the linguistic maze there; moreover, such articles will be a welcome help to those who go out and have to deal with the natives in the field when learning the languages in question. For comparative linguistics, Schellong's book is of great interest because it provides for the first time a comprehensive and reliable classification of words and, as far as possible, of grammatical rules of the hitherto unexplored Jadin language. On the basis of this list and others, which already exist and will hopefully be compiled in large numbers, it will be possible to determine the connection and relationship between the countless languages and dialects spoken in our area. The great diversity of these is made quite clear to us by the appended compilation (edited by Dr. Schnorr von Carolsfeld) of a large number of words in about 20 different languages or dialects of the Shuss area. The Jahin language is spoken by only about a thousand natives in New Guinea, and learning this language might therefore appear to be of little practical value. However, when one learns that the Jabin district has a very large area compared to other language areas in New Guinea, and that with the help of this language and the other interpreters it is also easy to communicate with the neighboring villages that speak a different language, and when one considers that the Jahin language is spoken in a very large area. that the Jahin language is in use in the area of the main station Finschhafen, where numerous Euroveans live and come into contact with the indigenous people, it follows that the book has a practical importance that should not be underestimated, and it is to be recommended for study to all who go to our South Sea possessions. Its practical value is all the greater because the author has diligently collected a large number of the most common words, has tried to prove their correct meaning with complete sentences and has spared no effort to reproduce as accurately as possible the sounds and words recorded with the obre. The many fluctuations and uncertainties which still exist and which are mentioned bear witness to the difficulty of the work and the care taken by the author. dr. H Eingänge für die Bibliothek. Given the limited space we have for book reviews, it will not be possible to discuss all works in detail, but we never fail to recommend new colonial writings, which are assigned to our library by the authors and publishers, to colonial friends in word and deed, for which the administration of the library is given ample opportunity by our members.

Announcement. As a result of a resolution passed by the Board of Directors on December 11, the organ of our Society, the "Deutsche Kolonialzeitung", will be published every four weeks from next year onwards. The next issue will be published on Saturday, January 10. The content will be changed in that in future particular emphasis will be placed on providing a summarized overview and assessment of events in the colonial field. The newspaper will then be enriched by the reproduction of reports from the representatives of our society in our colonies. If there are any reports that need to be urgently communicated to the members, the Committee will arrange for an extra issue to be published. Review of the German Emin Pasha expedition. When we set out to report on the then very uncertain fate of the German Emin Pasha expedition around this time last year, it was with a heavy heart. Even if the news was contradictory and some of it had to be put down to the hostile mood of the English towards the expedition, it seemed to be clear from all that had been reported that fighting had taken place at Tana in which the expedition had been involved. But we never gave up hope that all this bad news would turn out to be false and that the leader of the expedition would overcome the obstacles he faced on the African mainland, whether they came from the Ratur or from hostile tribes, with his own energy, which he had already repeatedly exerted in carrying out his plans. Today we can state with joyful satisfaction that this hope of ours did not come to nothing. It is true that the original purpose of the expedition: to bring help to Emin Pasha in Wadelai and make it possible for him to hold out at his post there, was thwarted by an unfortunate chain of unavoidable circumstances. But Dr. Karl Peters did what was humanly possible to achieve this goal. He saved the honor of the German name. Despite all the difficulties he encountered on his arrival in Africa and at the start of his journey, he made his way into the interior of the dark continent along paths that no European had traveled before him; He made his way as far as Victoria Nyanza, and when the news of Emin Pasha's withdrawal from Wadclai reached him there, he did not immediately turn to retreat, but crossed the dangerous border of Uganda at the place where Bishop Hannington had found his lod, in order to help the cause of the Christian parties to victory in this great kingdom. The consequences of this bold step will be revealed in the near future. In any case, the German Emin Pasha expedition led by Pr. Karl Peters has had the one result that cannot be praised highly enough, namely to show the world what German efficiency in our colonies can achieve on its own, even without the otherwise so strong hand of our government intervening to protect and support it. Dr. Karl Peters and his brave comrades have all returned home safe and sound. The honorable demonstrations with which they were received everywhere proved how grateful the German people are to the men who went out for a great national and humanitarian cause and risked their lives and health for it. Our entire colonial movement has thus gained a new, powerful impetus which, we may confidently hope, will also benefit our further colonial undertakings, whether they are operated by the Reich or with private funds. As already reported in the daily press, the German Emin Pasha Committee held its final meeting on the 12th of this month, received the accounts, granted discharge and dissolved itself, once again expressing its warmest thanks to Dr. Peters and his comrades. The matter of the German Emin Pasha Expedition has thus also formally come to a close and it is appropriate to take this opportunity to review the history of the company once again in broad outline. The history of the German Emin Pasha expedition is older than is generally assumed; it goes back to the mid-1980s, when Professor Schweinfurth was already working tirelessly on behalf of the abandoned pioneer of civilization, but without being sufficiently heard. It took an increase in bad news from the Sudan and England's policy of humanitarianism, which was cunningly combined with trade and commercial interests, before people in Germany became convinced that it was our duty to help a renowned German scholar and researcher in his plight. The Nuremberg department therefore submitted a motion to support Emin Pasha at the board meeting of the German Colonial Society on April 21, 1888, which was referred to the committee for consideration. The idea of bringing help to Emin Pasha made all the more progress in the Society's circles the less favorable the news about Stanley's expedition and the clearer it became that Stanley would not achieve the purpose he had stated at the time, namely the provisioning of Emin Pasha, even if the expedition were to succeed. In addition, however, the Arab question and the related movement against the slave trade took on a whole new significance; in the opinion of all educated people, Emin Pasha increasingly embodied the champion of modern culture against Mahdism, which was celebrating its orgies in Khartoum and advancing southwards. Some men who were enthusiastic about the idea came together in a unanimous effort around Dr. C. Peters, collections were organized under the table, and after Premier Lieutenant Wißmann had also made himself available to the enterprise, a resolution adopted at the board meeting in Wiesbaden after a heartfelt speech by the Director of the Imperial Post Office, Sachse, met with an enthusiastic response. The resolution itself reads:

Page 320

 "The Board of the German Colonial Society declares it to be a desirable undertaking in the national interest to establish a connection with Emin Pasha (Dr. Eduard Schnitzer) in Wadelai by advancing German stations in the German East African area of interest to Lake Ukerewe and further on, via the Albert Ryanza, and is prepared to support a society formed for such a purpose to the best of its ability. The committee, which was still forming in Wiesbaden, immediately appealed to the German people, and despite the treachery of fate, which at this time seemed to be thwarting the enterprise through the rebellion in East Africa, the necessary funds were soon collected and the practical implementation could be considered. His Majesty the Emperor had shown great sympathy for the enterprise from the outset; in a letter dated August 15, Chancellor Prince Bismarck declared it to be patriotic. The departments of the German Colonial Society kept the agitation lively, special provincial associations were formed, so that, which was a good sign for the ideal sense of the German people, there was no setback due to the uprising. The date for the start of the expedition was naturally pushed into the distance, but the general meeting of the German Colonial Society on November 22 sought to prevent a delay in the matter, which could not be ruled out in view of the situation, by adopting a resolution according to which it was declared necessary "that the expedition to help Emin Pasha should reach its destination in the shortest possible time and by the most direct route. As it turned out that, despite the news received from Stanley, Emin Pasha's situation was evidently still the same as before, Dr. Peters set off with Lieutenants v. Tiedemann and O. Borchert to East Africa at the end of February, where former Captain Lieutenant Rust had already traveled ahead to recruit Somalis. Peters arrived in Zanzibar under the most difficult circumstances imaginable, the English had not allowed the Somalis to land in Lamu, who finally found accommodation in Dar es Salaam, the Wassen were occupied in Zanzibar and Wißmann had his hands full, so that he, who might also have special orders, could not give the company the support he himself desired. It did not seem advisable to lead the expedition through German East African territory as long as the Arabs had not suffered a major defeat, and so Peters decided to take the Tanaroute outside the area of the rebellion and the English sphere of interest and blockade line, which Captain Wißmann had previously considered, and sailed on the "Neera" to Witu, where he landed north of the English blockade line and organized his expedition. We were in the fortunate position of being able to read the reports of the Emin= Pasha expedition about this landing, which was surrounded by a romantic glow, and therefore do not want to go into it again. But this whole affair still had a very unpleasant aftermath in the press, which repeatedly repeated the idea that the expedition was useless in and of itself and, in its exaggerated fear of the English, would have preferred - to the shame of a certain anti-colonial tendency in our daily press - if the expedition had been wiped out right from the start. But not only the anti-colonial press, but also the governmental press joined in this tone with great satisfaction, which increased the more clearly the proceedings of the English admiral against Dr. Peters and the expedition turned out to be against all international law. Party delusion was once again celebrating its highest triumphs. It almost seemed as if Peters had to fall victim to the ultra-anglophile policy of the Imperial Government of the time. It was the eager endeavor of his friends to create a sufficient counterweight against this current; in protest meetings and in the press, the German=national point of view was maintained against the official press and the result proved our views right, neither did the Emin Pasha expedition worsen the relationship between Germany and England, nor did it have the failure so much desired by a certain side at the time. While Peters made his way along the Tana under the greatest difficulties and finally stopped in Oda Born Ruva to set up a station there, news had arrived in Berlin of the approach of Stanley and Emin Pasha to the East African coast, forcing the committee to recall Dr. Peters and Lieutenant von Tiedemann. As is well known, the order did not fall into the hands of Dr. Peters, who had already marched up the Tana from Oda Boru=Ruva, where he had had to fight with the Gallas, through a wild and romantic area that no European had ever set foot on before Borchert's arrival. Despite the friendly negotiations, Peters had to fight with the Maasais on their borders more than once, as they constantly sought to create obstacles to his advance in a challenging manner. Beyond Kenya, the expedition again reached a more familiar area, Leikipia, which still had to be crossed before reaching Lake Baringo, so often referred to in East African geography. In Leikipia, too, the journey required continuous defensive fighting, which took on a fierce character, especially in the battle at Elbejeto on December 22. These incessant battles and the exertions of the perilous march did not dampen the energy of Dr. Peters and his companion, Mr. v. Tiedemann. On the 13th of January they continued from Lake Baringo in a westerly direction, initially as far as Wakore's residence (north of Victoria=Nyanza), from which they were only a few days' journey away from the former easternmost military stations of Emin Pasha. So close to their destination, however, Peters now learned that Emin Pasha had already left the Aquatorial Province with Stanley and had set off for the coast. Peters therefore turned southwest, through Usoga to Uganda, where the Christian King Mwanga and the Catholic missionaries had invited him. In Uganda, Peters helped to organize the situation and concluded a treaty with King Mwanga, whereby the latter opened his country to the trade and traffic of all European nations, accepting the relevant provisions of the Congo Act, and at the same time intended to enter into a special relationship of friendship with Germany. Despite the objections of English agents who intended to monopolize trade in Uganda for the British East African Company, the King stood firm by the treaty. The English help that Mr. Jackson was supposed to bring had failed to materialize! Dr. Peters remained in Uganda for a month, breaking the Arab influence in Busiba, and then returned to the coast via Usukuma on familiar routes, after having obtained a ban on the slave trade and the export of slaves from King Mwanga In Mpwapwa, Peters met Emin Pasha, who was returning from the coast to the interior. Everyone would have believed that the two men were deeply moved when they saw each other here, even if Peters had not reported it. What strange encounters Emin, coming from the coast on the route that Peters had originally planned for his expedition, and Peters, returning from the threshold of the area where he was looking for Emin, had experienced in the last few months, The original plan of the Eminz Pasha expedition, as already mentioned, had been to bring Emin Pasha the help that would enable him to remain at his post in Wadelai and to ensure the connection between Emin's territory and the coast by establishing a series of stations. This latter point, as far as the advancement of stations to Victoria Nyanza is concerned, is still one of the tasks of our colonial policy in East Africa today and we know from the official reports published in the White Book, we know from Emin's own communication, that he is just now busy implementing this idea in its political and commercial aspects and realizing the ideas which were also leading in the Emin Pasha enterprise. Who would have dared to think of such a surprising turn of events two years ago? Who can even imagine today what the future will bring us? But in these ups and downs of contemporary history, the observer can see the unstoppable advance of a deep-seated endeavor to promote the greatness and glory of the German Empire on the so often dangerous African soil, along whose paths the bones of the explorers are modern, and to set insurmountable barriers to the African barbarism of slave hunts and the slave trade. The movement we are dealing with here is aimed at such high goals, it is so deeply rooted in the ideal-moral nature of our people that differences of opinion and misunderstandings, as they now seem to exist between the Reichskommissariat and Emin Pasha. must fly into the air before it, like chaff before the storm wind! Emin and Wißmann. In No. 25 of the "Deutsche Kolonialzeitung" we were able to report a letter by Emin Pasha from Tabora, dated 18 August, which formulated his ideas on the slavery and Arab question and the organization of the interior in a way that met with warm applause in colonial circles and made it all the more regrettable that Emin Pasha had not yet found sufficient help to carry out his plans. The White Paper, which was distributed in the Reichstag on November 26, then contained a report by the deputy Reichsrat

Page 321

commissioner Dr. Schmidl of 2 November (received in Berlin on 21 November), in which the following passage about Emin Pasha's activities was found: Emin Pasha concluded a treaty of friendship with all Arabs in Tabora, and after appointing a Vali with the consent of all Arabs, he hoisted the German flag. Furthermore, he concluded similar treaties with various respected chiefs en route and had both Unvanvembe and the territory of Sultan Mtani of Ujui ceded to him. The Arabs in Tabora voluntarily handed over to him a smoothbore bronze gun and a 19-barrel Belgian mitrailleuse together with ammunition, and also ten elses still in Tabora and belonging to the house of H. A. Meyer. A. Meyer, weighing approximately 500 pounds in English. These will soon arrive here with a caravan of the newly appointed Vali of Tabora, Sef bin Said, together with various scientific objects collected by Emin Pasha and will be handed over to the local representative of the Meyer company or sent to Berlin after the transportation costs have been reimbursed. Emin Pasha left Tabora at the end of August to go to Victoria Nyanza via Usongo. He has sent Chief Freiherr von Bülon with 25 soldiers to Urambo for strengthening and reinforcement. Lieutenant Langbeld was soon to follow Mr. von Bülow with the remaining soldiers and 2 guns in order to provide military assistance to the successor of Pandaschara, who had fallen against the Wangoni, against further attacks by the latter. Once this mission has been completed, the lieutenant Langheld is to follow him to the south user of the Nyanza. From there, Emin Pasha wants to march to the western shore of the lake in order to finally establish a station there. However, he wants to leave the construction of a station on the southern shore of the set to Stokes. To overcome Unvanvembe, Emin Pasha does not propose the occupation of Tabora, but rather the occupation of the former mission station Kipalla Palla, which is about 1½ hours away from the Arab headquarters and which, according to the croquis sent in and the description, is ideally suited for this purpose. In the present state of affairs, however, I believe I am acting in accordance with Your Excellency's intentions if I refrain for the time being from occupying this point, i.e. from sending a stronger military force and a larger expedition there, although Tabora is undoubtedly the most important staging point on the way to the lakes. I was also unable to fulfill Emin Pasha's further demands for reinforcements and supplies, apart from the desired ammunition, in view of the absolute necessity for economy, but rather hope that Emin Pasha will achieve the goal he has set with the means at his disposal. The fact reported here that Emin Pasha's request for reinforcements could not be granted for reasons of economy caused an embarrassing stir in the German press, as was particularly evident from articles in the "Kölnische Zeitung" and "Allgemeine Zeitung". The "National-Zeitung" then published an enlightening article in its number 687 of December 15, apparently drawn from an official source, which read as follows: "The German Colonial Society recently decided to approve a few thousand marks for scientific books, instruments and a secretary for Emin Pasha. At the same time, a recent report in the latest White Paper by Deputy Reichskommissar Schmidt gave rise to the impression in the press that the Deputy Reichskommissar had received instructions not to support Emin Pasha's Tabora expedition. The colonial administration, we are told, could not be spared the reproach of having acted sparingly in the wrong place if it had acted in one or the other of the two cases as it is indirectly accused of doing. We now learn from reliable sources that Emin Pasha has not made any official report either directly or through Mr. von Wißmann or Schmidt since his command in the German Reich service. Accordingly, one could not have been informed in any way of Emin Pasha's wishes that would not have been granted. Even by private means, such wishes did not come to the attention of the competent authorities. As far as the second point is concerned, there can hardly be any doubt in the mind of anyone familiar with our military circumstances that not even the slightest influence was exerted by the official authorities in Berlin on the individual aspects of military action in Onafrika, especially since the Reichskommissar is legally independent in this respect. Therefore, if the Deputy Reichskommissar did not believe that he could fulfill Emin Pasha's wishes, this is a circumstance for which he is solely responsible. However, he was advised to be thrifty when he was informed of the Reichstag's last approval of the supplementary budget. This recommendation was justified with regard to the previous administration, but in no way was it recommended that thrift should also be practiced with regard to military actions. Moreover, after receiving the report of the deputy Reichskommissar Schmidt, he was informed that the plan to occupy Kipalla Palla, as far as this can be seen from here, appears expedient. Private messages arriving from the East Asian coast suggest that there is no longer a firm understanding between the Reichskommissar and Emin Pasha. This would also explain Emin Pasha's reticence to some extent. It is to be hoped that the establishment of definitive administrative institutions in German East Africa will prevent such uncertainty in the future. Emin Pasha is by far the first expert on Africa among the German colonial politicians; his judgment will therefore be entitled to first consideration. A few days later, on December 19, the Nordd. Allg. Zig. published the following announcement in its number 373: "From various sides, the Reich government is urged to pay due attention to Emin Pasha's proposals in its actions and organization in the interior of German East Africa. This admonition would certainly be justified if an authentic official report or proposal from Emin Pasha himself were already available; however, this is not the case. What has become known of Emin Pasha so far are only indirect statements emanating from him, which cannot be checked for their authentic character given the current situation. Thus, the letter of Emin Pasha from Tabora dated August 18, which was reproduced by the "Deutsche Kolonialzeitung" and which we shared with our readers, appears on closer examination to be a very skillful compilation of Emin's statements made at various times, mixed with subjective remarks by other people. It goes without saying that if the views of a confidant of an authority such as the Imperial Commissariat in German East Africa are to be heard and taken into account, they must be available in direct, authentic form. Emin's silence also explains why various assumptions and opinions about alleged personal goals that he is supposed to pursue in his expedition to the sea area could be voiced. We have the following to say in reply: the information which we described as coming from "private reports" was received by us from a source which excludes any doubt that it is an authentic statement by Emin Pasha, authentic in all respects. We have therefore brought the same without any attribution from our side and reject the insinuation of the Nordd. Allg. Ztg. However, we were entitled to assume that such an important document had also become officially known to the Foreign Office, or at any rate to the Commissariat in East Africa. Be that as it may, Emin's proposals are so well thought out and based on such reliable experience that the Foreign Office, even if the proposals were not officially submitted to it, is in our view obliged to give them thorough consideration and to take Emin's offer into account in any further action in Africa. However, under the present circumstances, there seems to be little prospect of this course being followed, as the Reichsanzeiger of 19 March published the following statement published the following statement In individual daily newspapers, the government is accused of having an inhibiting effect on the military action of the Reichskommissar in East Africa and, in particular, of being responsible for the fact that Emin Pasha has not found support for his proposal to invade Tabora or the nearby mission station of Kipalla Palla. The accusation is unfounded. Section 2 of the law of February 2, 1889, which forms the basis for action in East Africa, expressly stipulates that the implementation of the measures necessary to suppress the slave trade and to protect German interests in East Africa shall be entrusted to a Reichskommissar. It follows from this that by law no other office than the Reichskommissar, or his representative in East Africa, is authorized to influence the military measures. Accordingly, no other instruction was ever issued from Berlin regarding Emin Pasha's expedition than that it was approved on February 10, 1890, with the proviso that there would be no commando action weakening the forces of the Schutztruppe and that the costs, including gifts, would not exceed the sum of 60,000 marks. If Emin Pasha's wish regarding the occupation of Tabora was opposed, then this is a rule of thumb which was not influenced by Verlin. The following information from the reports of the Reichskommissar will provide more detailed information on the situation in East Africa. On April 28, 1890, Mojor von Wißmann reported from Zanzibar, as published in White Book No. 5: "Emin Pasha marched off on the 24th. I commanded the Leuknant Langbeldt to Emin's expedition and gave him selected good soldiers of the Schutztruppe. In a later report, the deputy Reichskommissar Dr. Schmidt reported, with reference to the report published in White Book No. 6, that Emin Pasha had lost a large number of porters who had to be replaced from the coast. "However, as I have also informed Emin Pasha, this must now come to an end and the expedition must fight its way through with the means at its disposal. . . As far as Tabora in particular is concerned, a report given by Major von Wißzmann on August 20, when he was here, states: "I have not given orders to either Stokes or Emin Pasha regarding Tabora. I know this place well enough to know that it is impossible to take drastic measures there unless you have a force behind you that is superior to the thunderous Krabs and Chief Siki.

Mr. Stokes has the task of setting up a station in Uniamwesi near Mikingingi as a new connecting point on the Bagameyo=Mywaywa road and the station to be built by Emin Pasha on the Victoria=Nyanza, in order to induce the great and really powerful Wanjamwest chiefs to send subjugation legations to Bagamoyo from this station. It follows that Emin Pasha and Mr. Stokes were to operate together. However, this cooperation did not turn out according to the wishes of the Reichskommissar. As Mr. von Wißmann telegraphed here immediately after his arrival in Sansidar on December 5, "Emin Pasha is making Stokes' work more difficult and disobeying every order." For this reason, as he added to the above message, Mr. von Wißmann recalled Emin Pasha after securing the base. Unfortunately, the above statement provides no information as to how Emin's relationship with the Reichskommissar and his deputy was regulated, in particular whether Emin had entered into a relationship of subordination to the Reichskommissar, which imposed on him the absolute duty to obey the orders of the representative of the Reich government. It is also completely unclear to what extent Emin Pasha was able to make Stokes' work more difficult after he had left the construction of a station on the southern shore of the lake to Stokes, as stated in the above-mentioned report by Chief Schmidt. Information about the content of the orders that Emin Pasha is said to have disregarded would also be urgently desired in order to give public opinion the opportunity to criticize them. Incidentally, according to the report in the "Reichsanzeiger", Emin Pasha's recall is to take place "only after the naval station has been secured", so we can still hope that a more precise investigation into the circumstances that led Emin Pasha to act in a manner disapproved of by the Reichskommissar will bring about a satisfactory resolution of this embarrassing incident. The news of Emin's dismissal, published by the Reichsanzeiger and, as one must conclude from this, approved by the Imperial Government, is already known on the East African coast; it will spread rapidly from here to the interior with the inevitable exaggerations and cause great excitement there. Emin, who has been recalled by the Reichskommissar and, as they will say there, has fallen out of favor with the Emperor, will appear in the eyes of the Arabs, as well as the blacks, as a man abandoned by fortune and will no longer possess any of the authority that accompanied him on his way into the interior. Respect for German power will no longer protect Emin. This poses a serious threat to Emin's life and freedom. For it could easily happen that the man recalled by Wißmann becomes a victim of the greed of the natives or an act of revenge by the Arabs. We would like to see our emperor's government spared the reproach of having brought about Emin's downfall. But in order to be sure that such an accusation cannot be made in the near future, it will have to be decided either to revoke the dismissal or to take all precautions necessary for Emin's safety. If Emin were to die in the danger caused by the announcement of the dismissal order, the imperial government would bear a responsibility that could not be shifted onto the shoulders of the Imperial Commissioner. Zber settlement conditions in South West Africa from the point of view of organized colonization. (Conclusion. Employment opportunities. The greatest difficulty in organized colonization is the task of fixing the opportunities for gainful employment and gaining a decisive influence on their development, which can be regarded as undoubtedly beneficial to the settler. Disappointments can never be completely avoided because failures are much less often due to factual than to personal circumstances. Even the best-organized colonization cannot teach the clumsy, turn the naturally dissatisfied into a panegyrist, or even the unlucky into a lucky one. The feasible intention must be to define the possible scope within which the righteous labor of the individual is offered the possibility of gainful employment, to protect labor from exploitation and, as far as possible, from external crises, and finally to extend the scope of employment opportunities.
Among the opportunities for gainful employment available in South West Africa, cattle breeding will probably have to be recommended to the settlers for some time to come as the most profitable and most appropriate to the conditions of the country; this will be the safest way to tie in with the existing conditions. Horticulture and agriculture in South West Africa, where no crop or stalk can thrive without watering or sprinkling the land, will only prove relatively profitable in a few places and with great effort, while a well kept herd of cattle must yield abundant returns if the settler is attentive and careful. This judgment is confirmed by the example of numerous white settlers, especially in the Bondelswaart area; the Boers of the Cape Colony and the Bastards of Rehoboth are also a good example of this. The endless grass steppes provide nutritious fodder for thousands of cattle and sheep, even in the rainless season. The settler can sell his surplus cattle to the traders living in the main towns without difficulty and at relatively favorable prices. At times these sales conditions have been less favorable, but in recent times the increasing demand for cattle for slaughter in the Cape Colony and in the east of South Africa has significantly increased the demand for oxen and sheep for slaughter, and it can be assumed that this development will continue, as it is due to the increasing industrial activity in the sales areas mentioned. In addition to the production of cattle for slaughter, the settler must be given the opportunity to keep wool sheep and Angora goats for the production of wool and Angora hair. It will perhaps be expedient to introduce good types of these small animals from the Cape Colony first, and to unite them in larger herds as the property of the community. The homesteads will then share pro rata in the proceeds of the wool and hair sold. Should it not prove advisable to unite the small livestock in communal herds, it must be left to the individual to make the right profit from this acquisition. The pastureland in many places is favorable for horse breeding. Horse sickness, which often decimates the population in the river valleys in summer (February to May), is hardly noticeable elsewhere and is extremely rare in some places at healthy altitudes. For example, the entire Orange river valley is completely unsuitable for horse breeding, whereas in places such as Warmbad, Keetmanshoop Blydeverwacht, Berscba, Rehoboth, Kubub and others, the horses thrive excellently and do not suffer significantly from the disease." The profit from horse breeding is no longer as considerable as it used to be due to the greater spread in recent times. Whereas ten years ago it was not uncommon to be able to exchange 14-15 full-grown oxen for a good horse in Damaraland, at present only 5-6 young cattle can be obtained for a horse of average quality. For larger settlements, which cannot do without horse breeding to cover their own needs, it would be advisable to introduce good mares and stallions to improve the breed, in order to make breeding more profitable. Mule breeding can be carried out with a greater prospect of benefit. Importing good donkey stallions would be worthwhile. Mules are particularly useful as draught animals and can withstand all climatic influences. Where horses cannot be kept, mules can be used very well. Of other domestic animals, it is worth keeping pigs and all kinds of poultry. Ostrich farming is one of the very good ways of earning a living; it promises to be a worthwhile source of income for the settler. A full-grown ostrich suitable for breeding costs, if we want to set the price fairly high, about 160-180 marks; the annual profit from such an ostrich can be estimated at about 80 marks. If we add to this gross profit the expenses incurred for interest on the invested capital, for the care of the animals and the cutting of the feathers, if this has to be done with outside help, at 40 marks per ostrich, then a *) In certain years a disease, a kind of old pneumonia, also becomes very dangerous for the young cattle. To combat it, both the Weihe and the Farbige use a vaccination method that at first glance looks not unlike Koch's new method. A diseased lung is placed in a bucket of water to obtain the necessary lymph. This is then injected into the lower end of the tail of the infected animal. If ulceration and suppuration then occur, the cattle are usually cured; if the disease has already progressed too far, the cattle die very quickly after vaccination, usually after one or two days.

Page 323

net profit of 40 marks. This is based on the prices of the feathers according to the very unfavorable conditions of the last few years. It is advisable to start with about 10 breeding ostriches when setting up an ostrich farm. Ostrich eggs can be hatched using an incubator. The eggs are easy to obtain and cost 1 to 6 marks each, depending on the time available. If cattle breeding in South West Africa is the means by which the settler obtains money to cover his needs for clothing, colonial goods such as coffee, tea, sugar and the like, and for economic matters, he will be able to provide his household with plenty of vegetables and to a large extent also obtain the necessary bread grains by farming and cultivating garden land. Good irrigation systems are the most important factor here, and the soil itself is usually very fertile in the vicinity of Onellen; in some places the yields are downright surprising. In Windhoek and Hoachanas, viticulture has already been practiced with the best success. Tobacco cultivation is equally promising. The best results in tobacco cultivation have been achieved with Kentucky and Virginia seeds; experiments with Turkish tobacco have failed and, as far as we know, no such experiments have yet been carried out with Sumatra seeds. We should not fail to mention that the planting of dates and fig trees has already been undertaken in various places with good results. The planting of the almond tree and the mulberry tree is also recommended by experts. Only time will tell how far it will be possible to expand agriculture if the available water is used properly. In some places, including Windhoek and Hoachanas, those familiar with the country consider it possible to produce grain and other fruits in excess of their own requirements; this should be seriously attempted by ambitious settlers, as this will provide them and their children with the best basis for future rich earnings, as it is only a matter of time before our rich West African colony will have a great future through the expected exploitation of its underground treasures. Other income-generating opportunities are offered by the operation of a craft. Wheelwrighting is particularly recommended as a worthwhile occupation. At present, all the ox-wagons used in the country are sourced from the Cape Colony; all cartwrighting in Namaland is limited to repair work. Paarl, Grahamstown and Queenstown are, apart from Cape Town, the main sources of ox-wagons. Paarl, a town of about 8000 inhabitants, lives mainly from cartwrighting. In the Cape Colony, the hardwood used for construction is found in the country itself; the softwood is sourced from Sweden. It can be assumed with a fair degree of certainty that the wood, which cannot be found in Windhock and Hoachanas in sufficient quantities or in usable quality, can be imported cheaply enough to make the construction of wagons worthwhile. The cartwright must, as is the case here in the country, also understand the blacksmith's trade; in general, the colonist should know how to help himself with all other needs. For this reason, trades such as carpentry, bricklaying, tailoring and the like are not trades that can immediately provide a sufficient livelihood for a young colonist. The needs grow with increasing development, which brings with it a greater division of labor and creates an increase in employment opportunities. The implementation of colonization. The colonization of South West Africa is a cultural task and a work of peace. A purely profit-oriented society is unlikely to be able to take on the task with the necessary prospect of a satisfactory solution, because the profit motive must take a back seat and the undertaking must above all take account of the ethical aspect. Above all, it is important that the settlers are not burdened with more obligations than is absolutely necessary according to the situation, so that they can enjoy the fruits of their labor all the more easily and securely and can have a stimulating and inspiring effect on the development of the country with their budding community. The Imperial Government, however much it may be inspired by the desire to secure peace for the tribes in South West Africa through cultural means, will hardly be in a position to invite German settlers to settle in Windhoek or Hoachanas and to make the necessary arrangements for this. The German Colonial Society seems to be called upon for this task and cannot refuse to take responsibility for its implementation. If the Imperial Government were prepared to transfer the property of Windhoek or Hoachanas to the said society for the purpose of settlement, a settlement society with the necessary means could easily be created from among its members. Such a company formed ad hoo could be given the obligations that are necessary in the interests of the settlers, and if one agrees in principle to such a contractual relationship, the only question that remains to be discussed is whether performance and consideration can be weighed up and balanced in an appropriate manner. We have no doubt in this respect; the possession of land is valuable enough to justify a capital investment which, although it does not allow the enjoyment of an annuity in the first few years, must, after a certain period of time, continue to increase the enjoyment of interest in a progressive direction. It is not a modern banker who will lend the money for this business, but the wealthy colonial friend who is able to foresee the future development of the colony with certainty. The expenditure of a South West African settlement company would not make administrative costs of the colony considerably necessary; the emphasis would have to be placed on the greatest possible independence of the settler or the community association, so that the expenditure incurred would directly benefit the settler himself. The security of the debtor also ensures the security of the capital investment. A colonist in South West Africa, to whom the company has made advances on credit for the purchase of a first batch of cattle, for the building of a house and the like, will not easily abscond or damage the company by selling the borrowed cattle; on the contrary, one may expect that he will be encouraged by the compelling influence of the community in the colony to manage the capital well. And thus he will be a debtor who can fulfill his obligations punctually and improve his situation appropriately. Here the interests of the settler and those of society seem to us to coincide very happily: just as the settler must attach importance to the fact that he can increase his possessions from small beginnings through work, so society must be interested in the fact that its colonization areas flourish through this work. It is to the advantage of the Company to facilitate and promote the settler's efforts in this direction, and this is also the basis of its obligations, which it must assume in compensation for the land cession on the part of the Rogation. All expenditure in this respect, such as water installations, improvements to the roads and the creation of good transportation facilities, are for the benefit of the property itself, so that it is not necessary to make a detailed calculation of this. It would also be premature today to go into all the details of the plan, as it is sufficient to reach agreement in principle on this issue. Finally, it may be permitted to point out once again that a comprehensive settlement of German farmers in South-West Africa, led by a company, cannot be considered until peace and order have been established in the country. In this respect, the situation is not at all unfavorable. If the recent raid on Otyimbingue by Wittboi has given some cause for concern, it should not be overlooked that the Imperial Government had reason to assess the situation with caution and patience, but that it has already clearly stated its measures for the future, which give room for hope that conditions will soon improve. The fact that this year's budget includes larger funds for cultivation experiments to create an information center for German settlers makes it clear enough that the protective rule is also to be actively enforced against Wittboi and his associates, to whose activities the Imperial Government cannot expose German settlers. However, the Otyimbingue raid became known after the budget had been drawn up, and it is only because of this raid and the other grievances connected with it that the government needs to restore order by increasing the number of protection troops appropriately. Furthermore, after the budget has been drawn up, important capitalist ventures are in the making in the colony, the execution of which makes it essential that the disturbances of the Wittboi be put a stop to. It can be pointed out with the greatest satisfaction that the growing tendency towards larger enterprises in the colony is pushing more and more towards the establishment of official bodies. Doubts

 It will be warmly welcomed in all interested circles if developments soon necessitate a law for the introduction of an orderly administration, provided that this law takes due account of the aid already available in the colony, which can be used to cover administrative costs. This point in time also marks the beginning of comprehensive colonization. The greatest difficulty that has so far hindered the development of the South West African colony, the ignorance of its true value, is fading: the mockers are beginning to fall silent, the doubtful friends are taking heart and, what is most important, the Imperial Government is giving its care to the establishment of an administration that is also worthwhile for the Imperial treasury. Herbot of the slave trade in Aganda. During the presence of Dr. Karl Peters in Uganda, he succeeded, together with the head of the French missionary institution P. Lourdel, in obtaining a ban on the slave trade from King Mwanga. The King's decree dates from Mengo on May 16, 1890 and has the following wording in the German translation: "I, Mwanga, King of Uganda, declare in the presence of Dr. Karl Peters and Father Simeon Lourdel that the slave trade in Uganda and the associated countries shall henceforth be prohibited and that I will do what I can to prevent the export of slaves from all the territories subject to me." Our Society can be pleased and grateful to see from this treaty that Dr. Karl Peters has succeeded in controlling the horrors of the slave trade in a large area in the interior of Africa and has thus significantly advanced the efforts of the international anti-slavery conference in Brussels. Notices from the Society. German Colonial Gazette. From January 1, 1891, the "Mitteilungen von Forschungsreisenden und Gelehrten aus den deutschen Schutzgebieten", published by Dr. Freiherr von Danckelmann and previously published as a separate journal, will be merged with the "Deutsches Kolonialblatt", the official organ of the Colonial Department of the Federal Foreign Office, and published quarterly as scientific supplements to it. The content of the "Mitteilungen" is partly based on official sources and contains mainly scientific news from the German protectorates, explained by illustrations, maps, plans and sketches. The annual subscription price for the "Deutsche Kolonlalblatt mit den Betheften" is 12 marks, for the Kolonialdlatt alone 8 marks. The publisher of the Kolonialblatt offers members of the German Colonial Society the opportunity to subscribe to the Kolonialblatt alone or with the booklets at a price reduced by 50 percent if they subscribe in sufficient numbers. In view of the solidity and importance of the Colonial Gazette and the quarterly supplements, we can recommend making extensive use of this highly commendable offer. Should the number of incoming subscriptions be correspondingly large, a further reduction in the subscription price is not ruled out. The Society's office in Verlin, Linkstraße 25, accepts registrations and will gladly arrange for the Colonial Gazette and the supplements to be sent to members, taking into account the very low postage costs. To order a subscription, please use the postcard enclosed with this issue. The board meeting of the German Colonial Society was opened by the President, Prince Hohenlohe=Langenburg, shortly after 7 a.m. on December 11, 1890. The meeting was attended by the following gentlemen from the Presidium: Reichstag Deputy Dr. Hammacher, Privy Government Councillor Simon, Minister of State von Hofmann; from the Committee: District Geologist Dr. Ebert, Director Kurella, Dr. E. Lange, Factory Director r. Martius, Vice-Consul Ad. Schwabe, retired Major von Steun, retired Lieutenant General von Teichmann u. Logischen, retired Lord Mayor Weber, retired Vice Consul Carl E Weber and Government Architect Wiskow; from the other members of the committee: Government Affessor Angerer, Potsdam; Reichstag Deputy Prinz von Arenberg, Berlin; Reichstag Deputy Oberpräsident von Bennigsen, Hanover; Hofrat Dr. med. Credé, Dresden; Reichstag Deputy Geh. Justice Councillor Professor von Cuny, Berlin; Count von Frankenberg=Tillowitz, Tillowitz; Attorney Hentig, Berlin; Reichstag Deputy Baron von Hoiningen=Huene, Breslau; Reichstag Deputy Count von Hompesch, Castle Burich near Cörrenzig; Government Councillor von Knebel=Doeberitz, Verlin; Wirkl. Geh. Rat von Kusserow, Berlin; Major Liebert, Berlin; Marshal von Bieberstein, Berlin; Director Dr. Mehnert, Dresden; Regierungsrat a. D. Schueck, Berlin; Professor Dr. Supan, Gotha; Regierungsorat Freiherr von Tucher, Nuremberg. The following departments were represented: Berlin by Messrs. De O. Hauchecorne, Paul Staudinger and Dr. Wulffert; Coblenz by Bergrat Dr. Busse; Cöslin by Regierungspräsident Graf Clairon d'Haussonville; Grefeld by Mr. Max Heydweiller; Dortmund by Landgerichtsrat Schmieding; Dresden by Messrs. Fabrikbesitzer H. Kretzschmar and Telegraphendirektor Mohrmann; Erfurt by Regierungsbaumeister Heßler; Frankfurt a. M. by Messrs. Kaufmann Ad. Baumann and Kommerzienrat Köster; Lübeck by Director Bruhn; Magdeburg by Dr. med. Hottendorf; Potsdam by City Councillor Jaehne; Ruhrort by Dr. Hindorf; Wiesbaden by Reichslagsabgeordnete F. Kalle. The President opened the proceedings with the following speech: "Gentlemen! As is well known, the borders of the overseas German protectorates have been largely determined by the Anglo-German Treaty. Many members of our Society were of the opinion that the conclusion of the treaty would put an end to our activities, or at least that we should pursue completely different goals than those stated in our statutes. However, at the highly important meeting in Cologne, which I was prevented from attending by a serious indisposition, much to my regret, the general opinion was that the activities of the German Colonial Society were not at all terminated by the treaty, but that, on the contrary, we had new tasks to fulfill. It was now a matter of making use of the acquired territories, of developing and fertilizing them. Following this statement by the Cologne Assembly, I have taken the liberty of giving the distinguished members of the Board of Directors and the representatives of the departments a brief outline of what I consider to be necessary work for our Society in the near future. In doing so, I have strictly adhered to the negotiations of our committee and to the relevant resolutions that the committee has already passed on individual points. I hope that in this respect I have generally conformed to the views of the honorable gentlemen. I say "in general," because we have before us a motion that seeks a completely new organization of our Society and would have a rather disruptive effect on its future activities. We in the Committee have examined this motion and the justification for it in detail and assessed it with complete objectivity. I expect today's discussion to result in a decision by the Board as to whether a change in our activities, the pursuit of other objectives, is appropriate, or whether we wish to continue working in the way I have taken the liberty of suggesting to the honorable members of the Board. Today I would like to point out that our Board meeting is the first since the return of our great African traveler, Dr. Petero. We would not be able to discuss East Africa today, what we want to do there, whether we should build railroads, whether we should establish stations, and whether trade should be developed there, if Dr. Peters had not laid the groundwork for this. Our society is certainly obliged to thank the man who gave his all for the realization of our ideas. No one can judge better than the members of the German Colonial Society and its Board of Directors how he was imbued with the aspirations that have guided us for the eight years since our Society was founded, and how he turned them into reality with incomparable energy. On behalf of all of you, I believe I may express the wish that we appoint Dr. Peters an honorary member of our Society. (Bravo! That is certainly the least thanks we can offer him. At the same time, however, I would like to propose another man as an honorary member; that is the one Dr. Peters should seek out. He is German, and we all know what he has done for Germany in the overseas territories, in East Africa. We know that he resisted the temptations of the persistent Albion and that he became German.

Page 325

country. In appreciation of what the man has achieved and what, God willing, he will still achieve for Germany and the German colonial territories, he certainly deserves to be accepted as an honorary member of our society. (Bravo!) If there is no objection from any side, I assume that Dr. Peters and Emin Pasha have been appointed honorary members of our society." (All sides agreed. The meeting then moved on to the discussion of item 1 of the agenda, the budget for 1891, after Dr. Martius, member of the Finance Commission, had explained the main features of the budget. The budget was then balanced at 103,200 marks. In order to procure the necessary funds for practical work, the committee decided to have the newspaper published only once a month for the coming year and to enter the reduced items in the budget accordingly. Dresden requested a new organization, Cologne requested a more frequent publication of the colonial newspaper, a reduction in the annual subscriptions and a change in the office conditions, while Waldenburg also advocated a four-weekly publication of the newspaper and a reduction in circulation by circulating the newspaper in the departments. The Dresden motion, which was accompanied by a memorandum, had already occupied the Society's committee and led to the appointment of a commission, which recommended the rejection of the motion in a motivated report to the committee. After a lengthy debate, the Dresden motion was rejected against the votes of the proposers. The Cologne motion was also rejected and the Waldenburg motion was declared to be settled by the Committee's proposal for 1891, which also proposes four-weekly publication. The motion of the same division to send fewer copies of the newspaper to a division than its membership, with the proviso that several members circulate a newspaper among themselves, was not approved. The estimates for the year 1891 submitted by the Committee were adopted in all items by a large majority. The President then turned to the second item on the agenda, the work program, which had already been sent to the members of the full Board and the departmental boards in November. However, as this communication from the President may not have become known in wider circles, we have included it here: In No. 16 of the Deuische Kolonialzeitung, I took the liberty of outlining my view of our future activities in general terms to the honorable members of our Society with reference to the German-English Treaty. In view of the forthcoming meeting of the Board of Directors, I think I may be permitted to describe in more detail to the honorable members of the Board of Directors and the heads of the departments the tasks which I believe should occupy our Society in the near future and the solution of which is strictly within the framework of our statutes. Some of the work described below has already been tackled. In East Africa, the undertakings of Dr. Emin and von Wißmann, which are aimed at opening up Inner Africa culturally and making these areas valuable for our trade and industry, are in particular need of support. It is initially envisaged, with the assistance of the departments, to procure the means of assistance for Emin that will enable him to set up and maintain stations in the lake region, insofar as the funds provided by the Reich are not sufficient. This primarily concerns the procurement of barter goods and articles for station construction. Lists detailing the necessary items will be sent to the departments, and we can hope that it will be possible to procure some from friendly manufacturers. The costs for the packaging and transportation of these items and their collection will be borne by the head office. In order to keep abreast of events in Jnnerafrika and at the same time provide Emin with the writing assistance he requires, we intend to send a suitable person to Emin on behalf of our company in accordance with a detailed agreement already made with him. We will thus receive regular reports informing us of the progress of the work in Inner Africa and enabling us to assess the way in which we will have to be active in the future in accordance with our endeavors.
Of great importance for East Africa is the question of how to facilitate transportation to Inner Africa. It may be possible for our Society to promote this important matter by first obtaining expert opinions and later taking over some of the preparatory work on the spot. It will depend on the results of Emin's and Wißmann's undertakings as to when we have to tackle this work. Next, in East Africa, the economic development of our South West African possessions requires our cooperation. Here we are initially planning to establish stations to investigate various areas for the purpose of colonization. The preparatory work has progressed so far that a first station on the middle Orange River will be established in the shortest possible time. Further stations are to follow as soon as the funds are available or can be raised from voluntary donations. Should these stations be fortunate enough to prove ore deposits worth mining, those departments that have made special contributions to the station in question should be guaranteed a share in the profits made. Once the boundaries of the South-West African colony have been defined, we will have to think about colonizing it. As difficult as this task will be, we should try to tackle it if parts of the country prove suitable for housing German emigrants. The imperial government seems inclined to transfer to our society some areas that are considered crown land for the purpose of settlement. Perhaps it is possible to interest individual departments or friends of our cause from the trading and manufacturing circles in this undertaking under special agreements. Furthermore, we should try to make our connection with the South West African colony independent of the English line to Cape Town. We hope to be able to make certain proposals in this regard very soon. In the interest of our other protectorates, we will not need to raise funds for practical work for the time being. It is more preparatory work that falls to the central management of our society. For example, we will have to endeavor to secure the internationally guaranteed freedom of navigation on the Niger and Benus; while securing the hinterland remains a desirable goal for Cogoland. In the South Seas, finally, we will have to ensure that German interests in the rich, healthy islands between New Guinea and Java are established in good time, so that the natural relations of the colony of New Guinea with the rich West can expand in the interests of other economic circles. For the other work of our society, such as the promotion of colonial knowledge, the provision of information, the emigration system and the support of German national colonization ventures, the principles observed so far will have to remain unchanged. The necessary expenditure items for these purposes will therefore have to be included in the budget without exceeding the previous level. The funds for carrying out the practical work are to be taken primarily from the surpluses that the membership fees for the year 189 will provide. If we are able to make further savings on the newspaper, we will certainly have around 30,000 marks in surpluses available for 189. This sum will not be sufficient to carry out larger practical tasks, so we will have to try, with the help of the departments, to form associations that seek to achieve the goals we have set ourselves by business means For example, the settlement issue in South West Africa cannot be solved in any other way than by forming a settlement society. If the Imperial Government transfers a certain area to the German Colonial Society for colonization and if we have gained the conviction through expert reports that the task is feasible, then it will probably be possible, at the suggestion of the German Colonial Society, to form a company on share certificates for this purpose. We have sufficient organs in our midst that are capable of taking the practical implementation of this task into their own hands. If the proposals I have made here are partially or fully approved by the honorable members of the Board, we will have to decide at the next Board meeting which of the practical tasks are to be tackled first and how the means to carry them out are to be procured.

 Should any proposals or suggestions be made in this regard, they would be welcomed with special thanks. Berlin, October 30, 1990 The President. Prince of Hohenlohe=Langenburg. After agreeing to the points of view developed in this letter, the Board approved the appropriations made by the Committee for next year's surpluses. The third item on the agenda was a motion by the committee concerning the fight against the slave trade and slave hunts in Africa, which was explained in detail by Minister of State v. Hofmann. The motion, which was adopted, reads With regard to the declaration of the V. Commission of November 19, ds. Io., according to which this Commission has ceased its work and dissolved itself, the Board of Directors resolves: 1. to express the Society's thanks to the Commission for its efforts to date and to use the funds transferred by the Commission in the amount of approximately 4000 marks in the spirit of the donors, i.e. for the pursuit of general cultural purposes in East Africa. It is left to the Presidium to determine the exact nature and manner of this use; 2. in implementation of the resolution of the General Meeting of 22. November 1888, to continue to be active for the suppression of the slave trade in Africa, insofar as it is possible under the existing conditions with private means, and to promote general participation in this matter, even in those circles that are still distant from the colonial movement, through appropriate agitation, in particular through the free distribution of pamphlets and the use of the local press, in order to raise funds for our own use and to make it easier for the Imperial Government to continue to implement the measures it has already taken to combat the slave trade with the most gratifying success. For the purpose of such agitation, a sum of 3000 marks is made available to the Committee for the year 1891; 3. to strongly support the collections organized by Major von Wißmann and the Committee for the Garl Peters Foundation for the procurement of German steamships on the East African lakes; to form a special "Fund to Combat the Slave Trade in Africa" from the funds raised as a result of the above-mentioned agitation and from any other donations, which the Committee is entitled to dispose of in favor of the steamships mentioned under 3 or in another manner corresponding to the purpose of the Merchant Hönigsberg's matters, the Board adopted the following resolution of the Committee: The Board of the German Colonial Society, taking note of the status of the case of the merchant J. Hönigsberg in Wachwitz near Dresden, instructs the Presidium to assist the merchant, who has suffered serious damage to his property and his livelihood, in the further pursuit of his rights before the German Reichstag. The Committee had also tabled a motion concerning the conditions in the hinterland of Cameroon and in German East and South West Africa, which was motivated by the President. With regard to the demarcation of Cameroon, motions were submitted by Mülheim, Cologne and Koblenz. After the question had been discussed in detail, the following resolutions were passed: "The Presidium is instructed to submit a petition to the Reich Chancellor, explaining the circumstances which endanger German interests in the hinterland of Cameroon and which urgently require a greater development of German power in East and Southwest Africa, to the effect that with regard to the hinterland of Cameroon1. The expeditions directed in that direction be significantly strengthened and pushed considerably further into the interior than hitherto; 2. Through negotiations with the powers involved, England and France, the borders of the German sphere of interest up to the shores of Lake Tsad be determined in a manner that is as favorable as possible for Germany and fully secures the connection with this lake, taking into account the claims that Germany has to make with regard to the territories north of the Benuö River; II. In East Africa, in order to fully implement the measures undertaken to suppress the slave trade and to protect German interests, l. the troops be reinforced as necessary and 2. Dr. Eo in Pasha be provided with the means to implement his proposals for the establishment of the administration in the northern maritime territory; III. In South-West Africa, a reinforcement of the protection force will also be brought about, which will enable the representatives of the imperial protection force there to put an end to the current state of legal uncertainty, which hinders the economic development of the country and, in particular, prevents settlement by Germans.

The reports sent to us by the secretaries from several cities, such as Frankfurt, Lübeck, Karlsrube, Erfurt, Darmstadt, Wißmar, for which we express our best thanks, show that everywhere the above-mentioned speakers met with the greatest acclaim and stimulated interest in colonial affairs Emin Pasha Committee. At the final meeting on December 12, after accepting the accounts and granting discharge to the Managing Committee and to Dr. Karl Peters, the Committee declared its activities to be terminated and dissolved. At the same time, the Chairman of the Committee spoke. His Excellency, Minister of State von Hofmann, expressed his warmest thanks to the German Colonial Society and its president for the lively participation and active support given to the Emin Pasha Expedition from the beginning and throughout its course. Lübeck Department. The first public meeting of the Lübeck Section took place on November 20 in the large casino hall, which had been given a worthy and interesting decoration by the East African weapons and ethnographic objects kindly provided by Mr. Weidmann, a member of the Wißmann Expedition. The chairman, Director Bruhn, opened the meeting, which was also attended by numerous non-members, with a brief overview of the formation and development of the Lübeck section, and pointed out that we did not want to engage in colonial pomposity here, but rather in practical colonial policy, and for this reason had decided to join the powerful German Colonial Society. He then gave Captain Richelmann the floor for a presentation on the topic: "What does East Africa mean to us? In a masterly speech, characterized by measured frankness, Captain Richelmann developed the reasons why East Africa was of prime interest to us. The fact that the uprising had broken out there was not surprising; great works could never be accomplished without disruption. From a description by Wißmann, who not only had his head but also his heart in the right place and was a master in the knowledge and treatment of East African conditions, he moved on to the troops, the natives and the current situation of the colony and then gave a detailed and strictly objective answer to the question he had chosen as his topic: "What does East Africa mean to us?" - The speaker was rewarded with rapturous applause and his presentation was also unanimously praised by the local press. Cologne department. For the Wißmann steamer, 316 donations totaling 38,620 marks were made to the German Colonial Society, Cologne Department, by the 8th of this month. The proceeds of all collections to date are still far from sufficient for the Nyanza steamer. Karlsruhe department. On his tour, Lieutenant Adolf von Tiedemann spoke in the local town on November 26. The speaker was a great success and raised a lot of money for the charitable East African foundation he had in mind. On the occasion of his presence in the local city, Mr. von Tiedemann was received in audience by HRH the Grand Duke and honored with a medal - In the Erfurt department, Lieutenant von Tiedemann gave a lecture on the German Emin=Pasha expedition on December 8. Jn free. 1¼ hour speech he unrolled such a captivating picture of the dangers and adventures of his journey with Dr. Peters and knew how to interweave the description of the countries and peoples to which they had come so skillfully that he captivated the numerous assembly, despite the overcrowding of the hall,

in constant suspense. After the lecture, a large number of the members gathered for a dinner, which Mr. v. Tiedemann attended until his departure for Verlin, which took place during the night. Mr. v. Tiedemann had been lecturing in a different place every day for several weeks and wanted to continue traveling and lecturing at the same pace for another week, an achievement that still seems admirable even after his travels in Africa. Short notes. (We have only been able to give a broad outline of the meeting, but we have no doubt that the members of the Society will be convinced that the Central Committee is taking practical and comprehensive action in every respect. If it is said in a much unclear report in the Kreuzzeitung that many members left the meeting unsatisfied and that it was predominantly theorists who ran the whole thing, then it must be said that in this generalization there can be no talk of dissatisfaction. That one or two members - the minority was infinitesimally small - may have been disgruntled at having their motions dropped can be admitted, although the way in which such an argument about a purely internal matter was carried out in a newspaper went beyond the pale, but we must dispute the view that it is predominantly theorists who run the whole thing. On the one hand, it has turned out often enough that those who are only temporarily in foreign countries do not need to be practitioners, but on the other hand, it must be emphasized that no important step whatsoever is taken by the headquarters with regard to the decision-making or implementation of any colonization measure without first consulting men who are well versed in the matter and obtaining the most accurate information. The Krenzzeitung would do better if it did not allow itself to be informed of the Society's activities and intentions by disgruntled members. - At its final meeting on the 12th of this month, the German Emin Pasha Committee accepted the statement of income and expenditure of the German Emin Pasha Expedition presented by the Managing Committee and discharged both the Committee and Dr. Peters. The funds received have been used for the purposes of the expedition and for Emin Pasha Bit, with the exception of a balance of approximately 6000 marks. This balance will initially serve as a reserve to cover any additional claims and, if it is not used for this purpose, will soon be transferred to the Karl Peters Foundation. As the committee concluded its work and disbanded, it once again expressed its gratitude to Dr. Peters and his comrades for their loyal dedication, courage, energy and perseverance in fulfilling their obligations to achieve a high, humanitarian and national goal. It may also be of interest to our readers to note that among the sums spent by the Emin Pasha Committee is a sum of 10,000 marks, which was made available to Reichskommissar Wißmann for Emin Pasha at the time and was mainly used for the latter's food during his serious illness in Bagamoyo. (News has recently arrived from East Africa about economic movements which show that the British are endeavoring to secure their trade in all directions. In German East Africa, however, they have fewer opportunities; they would have to move from Zanzibar to the coast as quickly as possible. A distress call from Zanzibar was echoed in English newspapers, but the Indians on Zanzibar had enough time to get their goods over to the mainland, because it was known from the beginning that the Empire would not change the tariff set by the trade agreement with the Sultan for the time being if it took over the customs administration on the coast. The tariff of 5 percent is of course very inconvenient and will make it necessary to declare Zanzibar a free port, but one cannot blame the Germans if they care little for the beaux yous of the Indians. The capital power of the English is more dangerous for the Portuguese in East Africa. English capital did not yet play a national role in the large Portuguese-French-English company that had set itself the task of exploiting the Manicamines; on the contrary, in the dispute with the Anglo-South African company over Mutassa's territory, the English members of the company proved that the Portuguese had incontestable titles of ownership here. The agreement between Portugal and England contained a clause according to which Porlugal was to undertake to build a railroad along the Pungwe so that the English would have a way out from Manica to the Portuguese Sofala. In the end, the Portuguese were granted the overhead line, but the money had to be sought in England, as Portugal was unable to raise the necessary sums. This is referred to in a telegraphic report of the formation of the East Canadian syndicate in London, which is likely to displace the Portuguese south of Sambest once its work has begun. The English are also making new efforts in Trausvaal, especially as the rumors about the unfavorable state of the National Boer Trading Association in Transvaal, which has also affected some of the German companies that had direct relations with this association, are based on truth. However, we hope that the relocation situation will soon be resolved so that the German side can also meet the wishes of Transvaal's leading press with regard to an economic rapprochement between Trausvaal and Germany. This case proves once again, however, that it is extremely difficult to find direct good connections and that in doubtful cases it is advisable to ask an information office such as the South African Trade Office in Dresden for advice.
(The "Volksstem") has recently pointed out the desirability of a closer connection between the Danish Empire and the South African Republic, insisting that the latter should work its way out of the political isolation in which British diplomacy has kept the young state until recently with the desired success. Now the aforementioned newspaper reiterates this idea and says: "Not only do a considerable number of Germans live in the Republic at present and important German interests are represented here, but the power which the German people have developed in colonial affairs in recent years makes it doubly desirable to make another attempt at rapprochement. The German Empire is preferably an industrialized state which must continually seek and create new areas of employment for the products of its trade, and the part of the African continent bordered by the same sea which will hopefully one day also surround the South African Republic will be the most suitable. The latter has practically no indigenous industry and will therefore become a willing consumer of Germanic industrial industriousness. We have been told that we already have enough of England and that we therefore do not need another great power. It is true that the British stock exchange speculators, merchants, manufacturers and missionaries have taken it into their heads that, to the exclusion of all other nations, they have the right to play the master in South Africa and cause as much confusion as possible. The mere name of Germany is, in their eyes, a violation of England's equitable claims to the monopoly of the transvaalian trade in money and goods. But we do not see why we should fear Germany's influence for political reasons, or why we should consider any other friendship than that of England to be forbidden. If in the past the first attempts at rapprochement made by the Republic were coolly answered by Germany, things have changed enormously since then. People have learned to have more confidence in the strength and viability of the government of the Republic and its organization, they are now more aware of the country's sources of aid and now understand that the economic needs of the Republic are a rich field for trade. Germany's industrial and financial circles are now somewhat more interested in us than before, as can be seen from the statements of the most important organs of the German press. If one compares the attitude of the German press during the recent visit of General Joubert to Berlin with that of the British press, especially in so far as the latter judges the general's reception in Germany, then this gives much food for thought." Finally, the paper hoped that the government would not hesitate to take advantage of the favorable opportunity that now presented itself. (The experimental plantation in Libreville in Gabon has successfully introduced rubber trees from Para, whose rubber yields a much better variety than the local rubber. Some 14,000 young plants have already been distributed to the natives and it is estimated that the experimental plantation will have supplied two hundred thousand plants in two years. Several species of coffee trees have also been distributed. In view of the importance of the introduction of new crops for industry and trade, it is therefore to be regarded as a promising undertaking that the German East African Society will resume the cultivation work in this direction, which was interrupted as a result of the war unrest and Semler's death.

Given the limited space we have available for book reviews, it will not be possible to discuss all works in detail, but we never fail to recommend new colonial writings, which are assigned to our library by the authors and publishers, to colonial friends in word and deed, for which the administration of the library is given ample opportunity by our members. Once again, we would like to express our sincere thanks for the books donated to our library. Receipts in December. Benko, Jerolim, Frhe. v. Dos Datum in the Philippines.
