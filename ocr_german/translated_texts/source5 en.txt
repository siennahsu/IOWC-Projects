About secret societies among the Wanyamwezi. By Fritz Spellig.  The following are some observations I made during my ten-year stay among the Wanyamwezi, the largest and most important Negro tribe in the interior of the former German East Africa. As I was occasionally able to observe, there are various closed and secret associations there, which are only recognizable as real secret societies to those who are more observant. Anyone who is not particularly keen to track down such things can live among the Wanyamwezi for years without having any idea of the existence of such secret societies. Their public appearance at the drum festivals, the so-called "ngomas", will at most be regarded as harmless popular amusement.  At the time I was there (1910-1920), the Wajeje, the Wa- nunguli and the Waswesi played the biggest role in the social life of the Wanyamwezi.  The Wajeje are associations of snake charmers or snake wizards. The not very numerous members are spread all over Unyamwezi and probably even beyond the borders of the country; however, according to my observations, they are more common in the north than in the south. Each district has its own special association, headed by the 'wawa wuhemba' (teaching father), the master. Whereas otherwise the ordinary Negroes show a superstitious fear of snakes and would never touch one, the Mujeje (singular of Wajeje) knows neither fear nor shyness. He believes himself to be immune to the bite of poisonous snakes through the possession of magically powerful protective amulets. The members of the covenant also claim to know effective remedies against snake venom. I was unable to verify the extent to which the latter is true, as they keep their real or supposed knowledge strictly secret. The Wajeje are held in high esteem by their fellow villagers and, if at all possible, they always try to be on good terms with them, because you never know when you might need their help. On the other hand, the Wajeje know how to make good use of their position by paying dearly for their snakebite cures.  As an old Mujeje told me, they kill snakes with the strong nicotine residue from tobacco pipes by coating some sticks with it and then placing them in front of the holes in the ground where they suspect snakes to be, so that the animal has to touch them with its nose as it crawls out.  From time to time, the Wajeje club gathers for a nightly dance under the full moon. The members form a closed circle in which three to five drummers and a few skillful dancers line up. The drummers sit in a row and work their instruments tirelessly in a sharp rhythm. The lead dancers - usually three of them - wear a short loincloth, a small collar coat made of black shaggy sheepskin or goatskin around their shoulders and a number of small iron bells around their ankles. Their performances are generally similar to those of the other Negro dances. First of all, they make a few rounds in a circle, stamping their heels hard to accompany the beat of the drums. The drummers' eyes are constantly on the dancers. Suddenly there is movement in the

Dancer. A shaking goes through the whole body, all the muscles play, the shoulder blades roll as if they no longer belong to the body. The drums sound louder and louder. The dancers' movements become more and more frenzied and daring. Their bodies are bathed in sweat. Now they stand frozen like pillars. Only the uncanny twitching of muscles all over the body continues. Then, when the excitement has reached its peak, they suddenly collapse as if struck by lightning and lie unconscious for a while. After a short time, the game begins again.  The dancing skills of the Wajeje take on a practical meaning when they are invited to weddings and other celebrations. Then it rains down pennies from all sides and the club committee has a good income when the celebration, which lasts several days, is over. I have also met the Wajeje several times in Tabora at large folk festivals staged by the Europeans for one reason or another.  The Wanunguli or porcupine people (from nunguli-Kinyamwezi the porcupine) basically present themselves as a pure hunting club with the sole purpose of tracking down porcupines, killing them and enjoying their meat. I might never have found out about the existence of the Wanunguli and their customs if I had not been made aware of this strange, secret hunting club by chance while searching for a porcupine skull for my collection. And yet this secret society is strongly represented in some areas of Unyamwezi, especially in the wider surroundings of Tabora, in the large landscape of Unyanyembe.  Like the Wajeje, the Wanunguli are also an all-male society. However, while more older people generally belong to the latter, the Wanunguli have a strikingly strong youth presence. The Negro boy, who has a tendency to hunt porcupines, joins the society at the age of ten to twelve. The chief of the Wanunguli, who also calls himself "wawa wuhemba" (teaching father), receives a gift worth four to five rupees from each new member. He is then accepted into the hunters' association through a nightly drum festival (ngoma). From now on, he calls the chief father and regards membership of the covenant as a kind of blood relationship. The novices undergo an apprenticeship lasting several years, during which they roam the forests and steppes with the chief or an older hunter in search of porcupines during the trapping season, usually at the beginning of the rainy season. Here they learn to read tracks, identify feeding sites and track down the hiding places of the animals. This takes a lot of practice, because although the porcupine is not uncommon on the high plains of Unyamwezi, it is a shy, very nocturnal animal and knows how to hide itself extremely well during the day. It usually spends the daytime hours in the numerous large burrows made by the porcupine in the forest. Shooting the porcupine also requires a great deal of skill, which can only be acquired through long practice.  Once the hunters have finally tracked down a cave after days of laborious searching, they first close the entrance tightly with wood, earth and stones. earth and stones. They then immediately report the lucky find to the chief and beat the wanunguli drum to call the club members together. By nightfall they are all together. The chief makes an offering and asks the spirits for success for tomorrow's catch. Then the ngoma begins, which usually lasts until after midnight. The dance

The Wanunguli is a kind of hunting magic, as it mainly consists of the dancers imitating the porcupine in its movements and gestures and repeatedly expressing the killing of the animal, which they do masterfully.  In the early morning, the company then heads to the location where the animal was found. Non-members are not allowed in. The entrance to the cave is opened and one of the younger, slimmer members, appointed by the chief, prepares to enter the cave. After the boy has removed all his clothes, he is rubbed all over his body with "dawa", a magic medicine to protect against snakes. leopards or evil spirits that may be lurking in the cave. Armed with a short spear, the hunter then slides backwards down into the hole in the ground. With the spear, the blade turned downwards, he scans all the branches of the cave. When he finally gets close to the animal, he kills it with a few powerful thrusts of his spear. The prey is then carried to daylight with great difficulty, usually not without bruised and bloody hands. In the meantime, the members have lit a fire nearby, on which the animal is placed without being gutted and turned and twisted until it is roasted black and crispy on all sides. Only then is it cut up. The head, which with its strong chewing muscles is considered the biggest delicacy, is always given to the chief; the rest of the meat is divided among the hunters, who eat it on the spot.  The Wanunguli also like to take every opportunity to stage public dances to fill their coffers. The most daring feats are performed. So I experienced itz. For example, one of the dancers had his tongue pinned to the ground with small, pointed sticks.  Probably the most peculiar phenomenon among the secret societies of the Wanyamwezi are the "Waswesi". As far as I could find out about the meaning of the name, 'iswesi' means spirit. The word is usually used in the plural form ''maswesi''. This secret society, in contrast to the two described above, has a strongly religious character and also differs from them in that its members are of both sexes. The practice of their cultic dances is vividly reminiscent of certain forms of possession religions, such as those described by L. Frobenius of West Africa.  The fact that the Waswesi are only to be found in the northern part of Unyamwezi and that most of their members consist of the so-called Watussi, the semi-nomadic herdsmen who live scattered among the Wanyamwezi, indicates with a fair degree of certainty that this secret society originates from the north or north-west. Their cult language also suggests that we are dealing with a foreign product. Incidentally, it is very difficult to find out anything certain and precise because the followers are strictly forbidden to reveal anything.  The first question is what kind of spirits are worshipped by the Waswesi, whether they are mere ancestral spirits or demons. It seems to me that the latter is the case. For example, there is a greeting with which the people greet the Muswesi (singular of Waswesi): '.gira lya ngombe". I have been told that "Lyangombe" is the name of a great demon, synonymous with Katawi (devil), who is greatly revered in the southwest of the colony, especially in the areas around Lake Tanganyika and Lake Rukwa as far as Kiwere. Likewise

the appearance and behavior of the secret society as well as that of the individual member in the processions and cultic dances shows a completely demonic character. Whenever there were Waswesi cult celebrations and processions here and there in the country and I met a member who did not take part in the dance at the same time, I received the following answer when I asked why he did not participate: "natali ku- sangwa n'iswesi", i.e. I have not yet met the spirit or I have not yet been possessed by the spirit. After that, every member participating in the ritual dance and wearing the characteristic badges and amulets believes himself to be possessed by a spirit. He is then no longer himself, the spirit speaks through him, the spirit (iswesi) controls all his actions. Therefore, if you start a conversation with a muswesi at the time of the alleged possession, you will only receive unintelligible sounds and completely garbled and distorted words in reply. Even the usual forms of greeting become meaningless, incomprehensible words. You have the feeling that you are facing someone who has escaped from a madhouse. I once tried to touch a beautiful old bow during a dance party and ask the price in order to tempt the owner to speak properly. I did not succeed. He put on a wild face, grunted and kept making inarticulate sounds from which you could only occasionally make out single words like: Let it be! The spirit refuses!  'Every landscape has its own special cult community, headed by a priest called "mutwale" or "mutware". He has to offer the sacrifices, call the members together on festive occasions and organize the dance celebrations. The followers of the secret society show him the greatest respect. If a Muswesi meets him, for example, he prostrates himself on the ground in front of him and remains in his position until the priest lays his hand on his head in a kind of blessing. In general, the Waswesi are held in high esteem by the rest of the Negro population; for here, too, the mysterious does not fail to have an effect and then it is always good to be on good terms with the worshippers of such uncanny demons; and finally, one never knows whether they will not be needed one day to dispel some stubborn spell of illness. Hence the reverent greeting of an 'adorned Muswesi possessed by the iswesi: any burdens are put down, weapons thrown to the ground. one rushes up to him, whether man or woman, places both hands flat on his chest and says: "gira Iya ngombe!" to which the person being greeted replies: "mama yandje!"  I used to listen to the characteristic rhythm of the Waswesi drum for days and nights. Then there was some kind of reception ceremony going on or, which was much more often the case, they had taken up residence in a village where there was a sick person. If a Munyamwezi does not get well despite all the medicine man's efforts, the latter often advises the patient's relatives to call the Was- wesi. They then settle in the patient's village for four to five days, make a lot of noise with drums and rattles by dancing day and night, eat well and drink a lot of Negro beer at the expense and for the benefit of the patient. In addition, a sum of 15-20 rupees is paid to the priest. If the sick person happens to get well, he usually joins the Waswesi covenant, either out of attachment and gratitude to his saviors or out of the need for permanent protection from demons and enchantments.

The Waswesi appear for their ritual dances in quite fantastic, even ridiculous costumes. The men adorn themselves with empty tin cans, strings of cowrie shells, dry tree fruit and all sorts of other things. They usually carry old weapons such as spears. Battle axes, bows and even guns made from wood. Fur caps decorated with many cowrie shells serve as headdresses. Very popular with the older members and lead dancers is a cattle horn made from the bent stems of calabashes, which is now also decorated with staniol and attached to the headdress. The women also adorn themselves with many amulets and all kinds of glittering things. They also wear the characteristic headdress, consisting of a veil of small white glass beads that fall in thick fringes over the face down to the nose. But all of them. Both men and women are armed with a rattle, which they make from calabash gourds and with which they can make a real hellish noise.  The ritual dances are outwardly similar to the other Negro dances, but are much wilder, more ecstatic, more demonic. As a spectator, you really get the feeling of all these drummers. Rattling and dancing, a demon has taken possession of them. From time to time, the dancers are seized by a veritable frenzy of possession until they suddenly fall to the floor as if lifeless. And the ecstatic drum music and the nerve-racking rattling of the cult community dancing in a closed circle contribute significantly to putting the revelers in the most heightened state of excitement.  These are essentially the characteristics of the Waswesi demon cult. It is not impossible, however, that further north and north-west, from where it probably came at the time, it showed other forms, perhaps simpler, purer ones, and that the latter have changed and evaporated through contact with other tribes.

Before discussing the Lebus skeleton, I would like to introduce this and subsequent works on prehistoric and early historical finds from the ...Pflegschaftsbezirk Frankfurt!)" and the neighboring district of Lebus, a brief comment on the position of the four districts mentioned in note 1 within the overall framework of the pre- and early history of the province of Brandenburg: These four districts (especially the district of Lebus and the city district of Frankfurt) have been "'marks' (peoples' borders) from time immemorial; this can already be seen from the "the Stone Age, which ended around 2000 BC. This can already be seen from the finds belonging to the "fading Stone Age" around 2000 BC, which show northern, southern and western elements, then from about 1500 to 500 BC a border of peoples runs from east to west through the present province of Brandenburg in such a way that
