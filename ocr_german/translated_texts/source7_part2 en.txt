did not know how to resolve this contradiction and rightly regards the information given to him on this subject as untrustworthy. Moreover, he does not seem to have been entirely clear about the prevailing social conditions. He says that the main population consists of rulers, the majority are slaves. But now this entire population - whether only the Shabali or also the neighboring tribes is left open - is called Adon, i.e. slaves, without any proof that they are in the relationship of slavery, for example to the privileged class. Rather, it must be assumed that the name Adon is merely intended to denote membership of the regal race, just as Arabs and Somalis in Aden are accustomed to call the Suabili and other regals Abid. Apparently we are not even dealing with a pure Negro race. James says he has never seen uglier faces; their hair is straight and coiled like a chignon, and he regards them as natives of the country. They cultivate the land with great care; the river houses are bordered with gardens, in which melons, pumpkins. corn, red pepper and fresh vegetables thrive. The Adon hound the Somalis and attack their caravans; they are all armed with spears and poisoned arrows. Like the Danakil, they must have killed someone to win the favor of the women, and only then are they allowed to paint the hump of their shield red and wear ostrich feathers. James had a great desire not to return directly to Berbera, but rather to take the road to Madisha on the Indian Ocean and thus give his venture an interesting and scientifically valuable conclusion. The journey there should take about twenty days and, according to the information received, not present any great difficulties, especially as there was no shortage of water on the way. James' men, however, put up the most determined resistance to this plan and all refused to follow him there, claiming that they had now fulfilled their contract and demanded to return home. Under these circumstances, James had no choice. The excursions into the surrounding country suffered from his people's distrust of the Shabali and from the enmity in which the latter lived with their neighbors; the longer stay in this place would therefore have brought no advantage worth mentioning. Early on March 4, the return march across the Evene, which leads to the Kär Hammer, was begun earlier than the Sultan, who had been informed, had expected. A messenger from the Sultan arrived at the first campsite and brought a cow and two bowls as a gift from him; he also asked for a written acknowledgement of the services rendered to the English, which he received. At a short distance from the Webbl, the travelers met two people from the Jval Abmed who told them that a rumor had spread in Verbera that the Rär Hammer had attacked and massacred the caravan together with the Shabali tribes. It was discussed how the return could be accomplished most quickly, and it was decided that the Englishmen would take the main caravan in a more westerly direction towards Hahi in the Ogaden, while Mahmud Addah, one of the leaders, was to go east to Gerloguby to procure cattle for slaughter there, which he was to bring to Habi, The journey to Habi showed a complete change in the character of the country's vegetation, which had developed into leaf and blossom and allowed the collection of many plant species. The rainy season, which tends to manifest itself in localized downpours and generally cloudy skies, had arrived and had also brought to life a world of insects rich in insects. At a loger above Tug Faf, the low-lying ground had become a vast lake and swamp as far as could be seen, while the settlements had been moved up the hillsides, and James expresses his amazement at how it was possible that a few days of rain could so change the physical features of the land. At Hahl the camp was pitched near some old gallows fountains and in front of several small pools of water. Despite the fact that four Ogaden tribes lived here and the land provided pasture for numerous herds, the shepherds did not want to sell anything, explaining that the owners were in other parts of the Ogaden. They only managed to buy two lean camels; Mahmud Addah also rejoined the caravan without the longed-for lambs for slaughter. The journey from Habi to Daror via Harradiged was covered in seven days without any remarkable events. The caravan arrived at the latter place on April 1; the first pools were dry; three miles further on, however, there was a beautiful pond on which large numbers of ducks and Egyptian geese were frolicking. In Daror, which was reached on April 4, there was also plenty of water. Here began the territory of Sultan Nur, Aud's rival, whom the travelers had visited in Bur=o. Besides the latter, Nur was also in feud with Sultan Deria of the Jdagallei, and James's men were as anxious to meet the one as the other. However, as James had already sent a message to Nur before his journey from Berbera that he would pass through his country, he at least considered himself obliged to keep his promise on his return. He therefore camped in Nur's territory; the Sultan was not present, but arrived during the night. He did not want to be put to shame by his rival and therefore also offered a splendid fantasia in honor of the rare guests, followed by Portuguese praise of the mighty English, whom he would rather have as friends than plunder caravans. James found Nur very similar to his cousin Aud; he presented him with the same gifts and gave his tribe the same tridut. We find no mention of the descent from the platean. On April 12, the caravan "left behind the densely wooded areas that had been so burdensome" and now passed through an open, well-populated grassy plain covered with many grazing camels, oxen, sheep and goats, on which the people of Berbera had settled with all their belongings after the rains had come. Shortly before the good end, James' brother almost fell victim to a murder, as a man whose brother was imprisoned in Berdera had sworn to kill the first Englishman he met. He was just about to hurl the spear from the ambush when the weapon was snatched from him in time and broken into pieces. At a place called Adardley, the travelers reached the regular caravan route to Berbera. On April 15, they bathed in the first Andlick of the sea from the summit of a steep pass and arrived safely back in Berbera the following day. As James also states, the more imaginable routes to the Ogaden and Webbi Schaväl are from Buldar, i.e. on average more westerly, and the water conditions here are considerably more favorable, but even on the best route one must assume six days of waterlessness. The route through the area of the När Amaden, Tema Assa and others included in the Jamess map seems to have been drawn too far to the west, as my sources, who had used this route, explained: "Then (namely after these tribes) we reach a wadi; we board a ship, the Adon row us. for which we give them money, and we come to the Aulivehan, the tribe whose territory James reached by crossing from the place he calls Barri, while on his map this route ends in Jme, which he occasionally describes as lying in the Gallalande. My own report" continues: "Here (at the Aulipehan) we sell the goods we have brought with us and buy ivory, myrrh. Skins, rubber and feathers until all our witnesses are finished, etc." This seems to indicate that the Auliyehan territory, to which James could only devote a temporary stay for the reasons already mentioned, is particularly rich in the precious products of Somaliland, or that it must be an important staple place for them, while the Shabäll seem to trade more in the products of land cultivation. These remarks, which themselves are not sufficiently complimented, should not and cannot serve to belittle the important results of Jamess' journey, and the present work will always occupy an honorable place in the not too rich literature on Somaliland. Apart from everything else, it gives a vivid and vivid picture of the character of the Somali people, rather seen from the benevolent side, since James was fortunately spared to get to know their darkest shadows. L. Hirsch. Communications from the Society. The Committee of the Society held a meeting on February 4, under the chairmanship of Mr. v. Hofmann, Minister of State, in the rooms of the Society, at which reports of the Commissions were received, especially of the Commission for the Suppression of the Slave Trade, which had held a meeting on January 20, under the chairmanship of His Serene Highness Prince Hohenlohe=Langenburg. The committee approved collections of up to 20,000 marks by the Commission to Combat the Slave Trade from the departments for the purpose of sending an authorized representative to East Africa. It was announced that departments had been formed in Wernigerode and Bernburg. The Committee expressed its gratitude to the gentlemen who had contributed to the establishment of the departments for their efforts. We are pleased to be able to report again today on the formation of a branch of our society in Quedlinburg, Bernburg, Antwerp and Löbau i. S.. The board of the Quedlinburg branch consists of the following gentlemen: Oberlebrer Professor Anz (chairman) and Gymnasialledrer O. Güssow (secretary); in Bernburg of the following gentlemen: lawyer and notary A. Wichmann (chairman), Captain (ret.) von Bünau (secretary). Paper manufacturer H. Lange (treasurer); in Antwerp from the gentlemen: H. Aldert de Bary, Consul General of the Argentine Republic in Belgium (I. chairman), former vice-consul of the German Reich Jul. Rautenstrauch, (II. chairman), Richard Böcking (l. secretary), director of the general German school Dr. J. P. Müller (II. secretary). Ad. Mund (treasurer); in Löban from the gentlemen: Director of the sugar factory Dr. Weiland (chairman), merchant H. E. Warnebold (treasurer), Robert Rowland jr. (secretary). The central management would like to take this opportunity to thank these gentlemen, who have rendered outstanding services to the establishment of the departments. - Berlin Division. At the meeting on January 31, which was also attended by State Secretary von Stephan, F. Bley, the former station chief of Usungula, spoke about the country and people of Usaramo. From a geological point of view, the country consists of three parts, a coastal area resting on coral, which is unhealthy but covered with lush vegetation, although it does not make a very graceful impression due to the careless cultivation by the Nezers, the Kingani valley, which is excellently suited for the cultivation of rice, and the mountains, which extend from Rusiji to Kingani. The latter reaches quite close to the coast at Pugu, where the Catholic Bavarian mission is known to have settled. As far as the cultivation of this land is concerned, the coastal zone is not suitable for large-scale plantations due to the poor soil and brackish water.

to further develop the indigenous crops in order to make them competitive on the world market. A lot of rice is grown in the Kingani=Edene, which is not yet exportable, but with the right choice of seed, a good product can be obtained here. In the mountains, which in some parts are reminiscent of the foothills, the prospects for plantations are more favorable, although the natives have devastated the forests and have engaged in ruthless overexploitation. In the mountains, where water is abundant, there is also plenty of good land on the slopes, which should be suitable for coffee cultivation and, where the sea winds are also present, for cocoa cultivation, perhaps also for cocoa cultivation, if germinating seeds can be obtained and termite-free land can be found. Speaker then went on to describe the overexploitation of rubber (as the natives simply cut up the landolphia, advised early intervention to prevent the devastation of these natural treasures by the natives, the character of the steppe. He spoke very unfavorably about the natives, the Wasaramo; he described them as lazy, ferge, downright depraved; which was partly due to the slave trade, the raids of the Masiti, but also partly due to their abominable customs. superstition, cruelty and so on. For example, they have the custom of burning their victims alive. At the end, Redner described the prosperous situation of the station before the uprising, the expansion of his cultivation attempts, which gave rise to many hopes, when the uprising broke out and destroyed everything. But from the melancholy reflections on what had been lost, the confidence emerged that the bloody seed would not remain without fruit, that German cultural work would regain its rights. - On February 7, Dr. Heuriei gave a lecture on the Togogediet, which particularly touched on the Pelitic situation. He drew attention to the change of throne in Dahomey, which meant nothing for the internal suspicions there. The planned French war against Dahomey was more important, as the Dabomey region still extended a few days' journey beyond the end point of the French-German demarcation line into the German Togo territory. There was no doubt that the French would crush the Dahomeyers, as the troops of the King of Dahomey did not mean much. The area north of the 9th parallel should therefore be placed under German protection to avoid any later complaints from France. Unfortunately, we had already suffered losses in the west; Kpandu was lost to us. Last year, Reichskommissar Zimmerer made an expedition to Kpandu, but this did not lead to the conclusion of a treaty, as the English had already established themselves with the chief there. Development in the Togo area suffered from the uncertain border conditions. The French have favored all kinds of Chilans on behalf of the postal administration, severely punished the transport of letters across the border by messengers, and the like. There has been no direct damage by English officials, but some pinpricks do not make for good traffic here either. It is not pleasant to have to deal with English judges in Germany. When the border is cleared, which is to take place in the near future with the support of Mr. von Puttkamer, we will be able to gain Kratji) and the Wolta and also open up new caravan routes, which are advantageous even though they lead over mountains whose pass heights are 3500 feet high. We can confidently count those territories in the north, which Captain von François had explored, as part of the German night area, if the English do not use the gap created by the departure of Captain von François for acquisitions. Even if Salaga is naturalized, larger parts of the territory explored by the Germans could come into English possession. The political development is of course linked to the economic development, especially that of the natives. It would be important to encourage the natives to increase production, as was done in Bismarcksburg. German colonial policy only had a future if it was based on the indigenous population, whose production was trembling. Then the Jslam, which is making great inroads in Toao, would have to be countered by a higher culture and the missionaries supported. The government should not only be the "custodian of the factories" but also carry the culture into the interior. It should also work in an appropriate way to ensure that the regents are put to work. - Magdeburg Division. On 31 January, missionary superintendent Merensky spoke on the topic "What can we learn from the colonization attempts of other peoples in Africa?" He subjected the colonization activities of the Portuguese, French, Boers and English to a thorough assessment, which turned out to be very favourable for the two leeward peoples. In the speaker's opinion, our colonial movement suffered from the outset from the fact that the difficulties were underestimated and the expected benefits overestimated. Colonization is expensive. New Zealand cost England 300 million marks, South Africa much more. On the other hand, the time is past when planters quickly amassed great wealth. It is difficult for new colonies to compete with the old ones. Africa's cultural capacity is also not always properly appreciated. Large areas are inaccessible because they are unhealthy, especially for women and children. However, there are also areas that are suitable for Europeans. These include the area of the Sierra da Neve near Mossamedes, the area from the northern end of the Nyassa to Dares=Salaam, the Ruvenzori, the Kenya. Here, Euro-Veans can do it the Boer way, but must not hope for great riches *) Kratil has gained special interest for us because it was recently reached by a German steamer on the Volta. According to a report by G. Ad. Krause, v Franeri's mission to place Kratii under German protection must be regarded as having failed, but a real treaty placing Kratsi under English protection does not yet exist. The ed.
that they can acquire. Samples of African products can easily deceive, they are produced under special conditions, which are not always repeated, and often - like artificial irrigation - can only be obtained with a great deal of waste and waste. Even plantation van will have its great difficulties. The most important thing for our relationship with Africa is trade. It is capable of a great increase where peaceful conditions can be created. The prevention of the slave trade is also important for this. It will also be a matter of creating security for the natives by avoiding the mistakes made by others, of making them productive, of establishing roads alongside the order. To practise justice, to eliminate chieftainship and the superstition of sorcery. The more this succeeds, the more the German colonization, with the good disposition of the Germans for their tasks, will not lack success. Strasbourg department. The general meeting took place in Luxhof on January 28. After welcoming the members present, Geh. Geg.=Rat lrr. Albrecht, as chairman, gave a very interesting report on the cosmopolitan events of 1889. The cash report was then read out and accepted. In the board election, the previous year's board was re-elected, replacing Prof. lrr. Gerland, who withdrew from his re-election, was replaced by Privy Councillor Freiherr v. Palow. The Oberlahnstein section held a gentlemen's evening on February 1, 1890 in the Hotel Weller there. On this occasion, the chairman of the department, Mr. Amtsrichter von Bülow, gave an overview of the contents of the new works by Brix Förster: Geschichte und Geogrophie Deutich=Ostafrikas; and by Dr. Oskar Baumann: Während des Aufstandes in Deutsch=Ostafrika. The report was generally well received and was made much clearer by the fact that the speaker illustrated the location and nature of East Africa by referring to maps. The rest of the evening was devoted to the discussion of departmental matters. The map sheets of Cameroon and Togoland were also presented for general inspection and discussion. Their accurate execution was acknowledged. - The Cologne department held a lecture evening on February 3 in the Isabellensaal of the Gürzenich. Mr. Marinepfarrer Wangemann gave his audience, who filled the hall to the last seat, an extraordinarily interesting picture of East African cultural conditions. Beginning with the desolate port of Kismajn, the scene of the assassination of the noble Dr. Jühike, which was still underdeveloped, he showed pictures of the most important East African ports: Hohenzollernhafen, Mandabai, Lamu and Zanzibar, and he described with immense vividness the whole life, the economic, political and social changes in these places of a peculiar culture burgeoning in a wildly romantic environment, which at present forms an interesting mixture of oriental pasha economy and the purposeful, energetic progress of modern Europeanism. Speaker described the spacious Manda Bay near Witu, which cuts deep into the land, as perhaps the most valuable starting point for German colonization activity on the East African continent, which offered space for the largest war and merchant fleets and had no equal in the whole of East Africa. The islands of Manda and Patta, the former separated from the German mainland by a channel only a few meters wide, close off the bay from the sea and protect it from the storms of the Indian Ocean. In the interest of our position of power in East Africa, Redner would deeply regret it if these favored places, on which the ruins of mighty buildings bear witness to the high culture that once prevailed there and which would flourish again under the strong hand of the Germans, fell into the hands of the English. The speaker then commemorated the serious and laborious activities that the pioneers of German culture, especially the missionaries of both conferences, were developing in East Africa, and described how great efforts were still needed there for written charity and how a court charity was urgently needed, especially in Zanzibar, to care for the sick and suffering Germans. The assembly thanked the speaker with a long applause. Following the lecture, the department contributed 500 marks for the hospice from ready funds and then organized a list collection among its members and friends, through which this amount was more than doubled on the first day - Department Danzig. The department held its general meeting on January 25, which was attended by a large number of members. The chairman, Kommerzienrat John Gibsone, opened the meeting with an overview of the colonial political situation, during which he commemorated the department's lively prosperity and the blossoming of the colonial spirit in Danzig. The annual accounts were then approved and the treasurer, businessman Otto Wanfried, was discharged after approval by the two auditors, Auditeur Pilling and Regierungs=Affessor Dr. Kantz. The old board was re-elected with the proviso that Lieutenant v. Kern was replaced as first secretary by Government Assessor Dr. Kauß, so that the board is now composed as follows: 1st Chairman Privy Councillor of Commerce John Gidsone, 2nd Chairman Medical Councillor Dr. Semon, Secretary and Librarian Government Assessor Dr. Kauß, Deputy Auditor Pilling. Schagmeister Kaufmann Premier=Leutnant a. D. Otto Wanfried, Deputy Stabsarzt Dr. Krosta, Minutes Secretary Consul Alexander Gibsone, Assessors Kaufmann Martin Morwin, Leutnant v. Kern, Leatnant z. S. Gercke, Regierungs=Assessor Messerschmidt. Small announcements. - (Major Liebert, the local representative of Major Wißmann, who was recently decorated by the Emperor with the 3rd Class Order of the Crown for his services, has arrived at Wißmann with ten officers and about 30 sub-officers to supplement the German Schutztruppe.

man's orders to serve against the Arabs in the south, left for East Africa. The names of the officers are: Lieutenant Scherner, retired Premier Lieutenant Heomons of the 7th Rhenish Infantry Regiment No. 69, Lieutenant v. Zigewitz of the 3rd Posen Infantry Regiment No. 58, Lieutenant Hogrefe, Lieutenant v. Elpons of the Grenadier=Regiment Graf Kleist von Nollendorf (1st West Prussian) No. 6, Leutnant Schenk, Leutnant Podlech of the Eisenbahn=Regiment, Leutnant Burger of the 121st InfanterieRegiment (J. Württembergisches), Lieutenant Wolfram of the 1st Bavarian Foot Artillery Regiment, Lieutenant von dem Kuesedeck of the 1st Guards Regiment z. F. In addition, Assistant Doctor Dr. Steuder of the Cuirassier Regiment von Seydlitz (Magdeburgisches No. 7) was sent out (New reports by Major Wißmann, dated December 37, 28 and January 1, have been received by the Chancellor. The first contains the report on the capture of Buschiri and his interrogation, with the interesting remark that Buschiri had testified that Said Chalisa had told him, before Wißmann had defeated him for the first time at Bagamovo, that if he held out against us, he would later make him vezier of the whole coast. He was unable to produce any evidence. (Therefore, of course, Bushiri's statement need not be false, since in such cases the Arabs are just as unlikely as Europeans to hand over anything in writing. D. R.) The second report announces the pleasing fact that the chiefs of the hinterland, from Bondei, Usambara and North Useguha, have presented themselves for peaceful negotiations and that Zimbodia has sent his son to document his peaceful intentions. Dos Gediet Bana Heris, to the west and south of Mkwadia, still showed no inclination to submit, so that Chief Dr. Schmidt led an expeditionary force there. The priests of the Baprian mission had arrived in Dar=es=Salaam and set up workshops for ship repairs. Arrangements were made so that Wißmanns could moor all vehicles directly at a landing stage in order to take cobles and fresh water from above on board. Rooms are being prepared to accommodate all the ship and artillery material, as Dares=Salaam is the first port and the best location on the coast once the south has been regained. It is also a pleasing fact that the natives are on our side everywhere, providing us with news and fighting with us against the rebels. This is the first proof that the many battles have resulted in the natives breathing freely against the oppression of the Arabs. The third report describes the battle for the Boma Bana Heris, which was unfavorable for us. As is well known, the breach has been wiped out again (The actions of the British in East Africa.) After the British East African Company had induced the Sultan of Witn to abandon the Beledsoni Canal, it went one step further and occupied the islands of Manda and Patta and planted its flag there. This step is all the more surprising as no decision has yet been reached on the Manda and Patta islands. The claims of the British East African Company with regard to the islands of Manda and Patta were, as is well known, based on claims to ownership of these islands by the Sultan of Sanstbar, which remained unrecognized by Germany and England in the Anglo-German agreement of 1886. Private agreements between the British East African Company and the Sultan of Zanzibar cannot change this situation. The British East African Company evidently wanted to benefit from the presence of a larger British Zanzibar force at the mouth of the Tana and, without waiting for a decision on the dispute, let force take precedence over justice. They had long since allowed the chiefs on Patta to work in their favor, one of whom, Mié Seff, is even said to have been granted an English letter of protection by Admiral Fremantle last year on the occasion of his presence in Sanstbar. We do not believe that the German imperial government will allow the latest case of British arrogance to pass quietly, especially since not only the future of the Witu territory, which has been under German protectorate for years, but also to a large extent the prosperous development of the southern (German) Somali coast depends on the reversal of the step taken by the British East African Company. Now that Lamn Island has been conceded to the British, Kweihu Bay, at the northern end of Patta Island, has taken on increased importance for both territories, and a glance at the map shows that it will be greatly impaired if the offshore islands are in foreign hands. Negotiations are underway to submit the ownership of the islands to a court of arbitration. As we were able to report in the previous issue, based on very precise information, the claims of the Sultan of Witu are incontestable from a historical point of view; in addition, the Denhardt brothers have acquired rights to certain beaches and, as is well known, the Deutsche Witngesellschaft had already established a station here. - (Dr. Haus Meyer) gave an excellent lecture in form and content at a meeting of the Society for Geography on February 8 on his ascent of the 6,000-meter-high Kilimanjaro in the company of Purtscheller, which was an achievement of the first order. As the individual contributions to this ascent have already been described in the newspapers, we will confine ourselves to the colonial political aspects. Redner describes King Mandara, whose legation was in Berlin last year, as a greedy, pleasure-seeking man whose raids have turned the surroundings of his country into a wasteland. In particular, he is in a bitter feud with Sina, the king of Kiboso, a man of apparently better fortune and strength, who will probably be victorious in the end. When the travelers asked Mandara whether their visit was acceptable to him, as they were unfortunately unable to give him the gifts he had intended, he replied that they would come if only they did not come completely empty-handed. He especially wished to have cannons to defeat his opponents. Back in Sanstdar, Meyer gained the impression that more peaceful conditions would soon arise on the coast; Wissmann's successes had discouraged the Arabs, so that they would submit to the "Kiswet" sooner or later. The general impression in Sanstbar was that Stanley's appearance had shaken Emin's position to a decisive degree; incidentally, no one doubts that this voyage was primarily for political purposes. The German Emin enterprise, Redner concluded, had been an ideal one, at least in its beginnings, while the English one had been aimed from the outset at expanding the English sphere of power, and it had been a great mistake of German colonial policy to allow the English such great influence over our East African territories by giving up Lamu, etc. In order to strengthen German influence, it would perhaps be best to make Emin the governor of a German aquatorial province in the interior of Africa. - We fully agree with this wish and hope that the Imperial Government will make efforts to recruit such an excellent man as Emin for the purposes of German colonization. (Stanley) gave a lengthy speech about his expedition at a banquet in Cairo, which, in addition to some well-known features, also contains some more anecdotal ones, but which are nevertheless of interest in assessing the situation. This is what he says about Tippo Tip: "I had taken with me a venerable old pirate, Buccaneer, freebooter, slave trader, named Tippo Tip, as it was necessary to pass through part of his territory, but as I had no mission to fight anyone, I fed and entertained him and introduced him to people as someone who would not be as bad as his reputation. As a result, Tippe Tip received many proofs from Europeans that they would be inclined to be friendly to him and hold him in high honor if he fulfilled his contract honestly. At the Cape he had said that he had formerly been convinced that "all white men were fools", but that after seeing their important works he had gladly modified his opinion to the effect that there was something in them after all. Perhaps you, dear friend Tippo Tiv, will gradually learn more and finally admit that the English are as clever as the Arabs." Stanley thus accurately reflects the position of the Arabs towards European civilization; they will never recognize our superiority in our East African protectorate if we only exploit a trading colony there and do not at the same time carry out cultivation work on a large scale. A second remark, which sheds some light on the choice of route for the march out, he made in a comment after he had said that various members of the Congo Route Committee had been abbold: "I telegraphed to Zanzibar to send 200 porters with rice to Mywapwa, the outermost point of the German protectorate. A few days later I received a letter from the Foreign Office saying that the eastern route might cause certain foreign entanglements and that I should avoid this if possible. The eastern route was therefore finally dropped." The Times remarks that it cannot understand why "foreign entanglements" could occur on the eastern route. We believe we have clarified the situation sufficiently in the editorial in this issue. The promoters of the English Emin Pasha expedition had bigger plans in mind than they publicly admitted; the fact that they were not carried out was due to the circumstances. Moreover, at the banquet given in his honour, Stanley took the opportunity to glorify himself at the expense of our compatriot Emin Pasha. He hardly touched on the fact that the actual and main purpose of his expedition, namely to make it possible for Emin Pasha to remain in the Aquatorial Province, was totally unsuccessful, but he blamed Emin for not deciding to leave immediately, which, however, can only be to his credit in the eyes of all those not involved (Togo region.) Lieutenant Herold will shortly be leaving for the Togo area to support or replace First Lieutenant Kling in his work, as according to a message from G. Krause, First Lieutenant Kling intends to return to Europe in March. The government is currently in negotiations with a zoologist and botanist. Premier Lieutenant Kling has sent the following information about the death of Dr. Wolf: "On April 23, Dr. Wolf left the Bismarcksburg station. He did not choose the route via nearby Keffi to enter Dabome, which would have been quite easy for him due to the numerous Dahome people living there under a special chief, but rather, as I gather from the papers he left behind, he decided to march to the eastern border of Dabome for geographical reasons in order to enter the so-called empire from here. The population, which, although outwardly adhering to the Mohammedan faith, is still devoted to fetish worship, was quite friendly, thanks in particular to the good relations that Dr. Wol always maintained with the mollahs, the Mohammedan clergy. The only obstacle was the amount of time the negotiations took. Dr. Wolf stayed in Suga Wangara, for example, from May 17 to June 5. From here he wanted to enter Bariba, which had been decried as rapacious. On the way there, on June 11, De. Wol fell with his horse over a tree trunk lying across the path, injured his right arm and for a short time was not in full possession of his mental powers. After this fall, Dr. Wolf, who had already had a severe attack of fever on June 1, is said to have developed the fever in quick successive attacks. Although quite ill, Dr. Wolf travelled, partly on horseback, partly in a hammock, to Ndali, a village 4 hours away from the Barida main town of Mpellele, the residence of "King" Koto. Because of the intense heat, Dr. Wolf moved from his large travel tent into a small officer's tent. But things did not improve here either. The symptoms that emerged were almost certainly

suggesting a vernicose pinna. Dr. Wolf was fully aware of his hopeless condition, even though he occasionally lost consciousness and phantasized. When he felt his death approaching, he instructed the interpreter to wrap him in the German flag after his death, to fire a volley of 20 shots over his grave and to bring the crew safely to the station, where he was to deliver the books and papers to me. On June 26, 20 minutes before 8 o'clock in the evening, Dr. Wolf fell asleep and was buried the next day in a coffin on palm ribs in front of the village by the road. Instead of turning back immediately, the caravan drifted around for five months on a route that could easily have been covered in four weeks with easy marches and many days of traveling, losing many personal belongings and expedition goods in the process. On November 20, one of our men came from Dofoli to the station with a nobleman, whom Dr. Wolf had taken with him, and brought the message of mourning; the caravan itself arrived the following day. Boundaries of the German territory in South West Africa). The "Capo-Timos", published in Cape Town, published an article in its weekly edition on January 22nd of this year, in which, on the basis of an allegedly reliable report, it is stated that Germany has occupied the entire area north of the 22nd parallel as far as the Portuguese territory of Messamedes and east of Damaraland as far as the 24th meridian and even as far south as the Portuguese territory of Damaraland. Rietfontein, one of the mission stations in the otherwise so arid German South West Africa, had exceptionally abundant rainfall last year. The whole area was clothed in lush vegetation. The herds of the natives, who would otherwise have to roam for hours to find the food they needed, had plenty of pasture in the immediate vicinity of the station. The dams built in suitable places had dammed up large quantities of water, so that the grain in the fields in front of them, which were flooded with water, thrived in the best possible way. The station took on a completely different appearance. The otherwise scattered natives gathered there and built their light mat houses into a long road. - The reinforcements of the German Schutztruppe arrived safely in Sandwichbafen on 25 January - (The Pia Societas Missionum [Palotina]), which was founded by Vincenzo Palotti in 1850 and carries out its missionary activities mainly in Brazil, has received permission to carry out missionary work in Cameroon on the condition that its members must be German. (After its meeting, the Anti-Slavery Commission in Brussels first had to deal with the Belgian proposal for an absolute ban on the importation of water, which was rejected by the Commission because Germany, France, England and other countries considered it unfeasible. On the other hand, another proposal was made and accepted in principle, according to which each night on its African territory should directly supervise the keeping of arms and the importation of water, and suspend all transports which it assumed were intended for slave hunters. In this way, the legitimate water trade would not be suppressed, while on the other hand it would be possible to prevent the supply of water and ammunition to the slave hunters. The details of the implementation are not yet clear. The first commission of the Antillean Congress has discussed the measures concerning the protection of the caravan routes and the prevention of slave traffic on land. Agreement was reached on the majority of the necessary regulations. The agreement between the powers to monitor the slave trade by sea failed. England renounced its own proposal to make the right to search ships a common one, as France insisted on its opposition to it. The treaties concluded between England and a number of other powers (including Germany), which guarantee the right to search ships on the high seas, remain in force. However, if the full consensus did not produce a different result than the Commission, this right would not apply to French ships and the Arab slave traders would still be able to use the French flag with impunity. (The Portuguese government) has sent a note on the Anglo-Royal conflict to all powers. It is not known for certain what is in this note, apart from the request for a conference, but it is said to emphasize that Lord Salisbury declared in the House of Lords in May last year that the territory in which Major Serva Pinto was operating was not under British protection, and that Great Britain never notified the Portuguese Government that it considered Nrassaland to be British property. From this it can be concluded that Portugal is adhering to the diplomatic history of the dispute and has found in it very important arguments for its right. Strange to say, it is Lord Salisbury himself who has cut the Portuguese's teeth with which they are now fighting against him. We still maintain that Portugal was able to extend its sovereign rights, which it had on the coast, into the interior, since the interior did not belong to England, was still under English protectorate and this was repeatedly and solemnly recognized by England until well into the last year (in May by the Under-Secretary of State Fergusson on behalf of the government in the House of Commons). - (Sir Francis de Winton.) who has returned to England iit, according to English newspapers, has not succeeded in bringing about any binding agreements on the future position of Swaziland - (Colonial School in France.) The Colonial School, which has been functioning in Paris since 1885, has recently been subjected to a reorganization. Whereas in the past it only accepted young natives from the colonies in order to teach them French language skills and a higher elementary education, it now also accepts young French people from the mother country. For this purpose, the school has been divided into two sections, the Native and the French section. In the future, the French section will include administrative officials, judges (who must, however, have passed the legal licensing examination before entering the colonial school), the staff of the residencies in Annam and Tonkin, the colonial bureau and the colonial ministry, and so on. The French section consists only of extra-nationals; they acquire the not only desirable but almost absolutely necessary knowledge of the language of the colony concerned through the young natives attending the colonial school. The latter are mainly intended to contribute to the spread of the French language, French customs and traditions, etc. in their homeland and to serve as interpreters, but a career as a lower-ranking civil servant in the colonial service was and is also open to them.

In the short time before the end of the last civil war in Camoo, the long-held wish of the Germans living there to be able to give their children a German education was fulfilled. Through generous contributions from the local Germans, a German school was founded, which was opened on August 1, 100 with a total of 6 pupils under the direction of Dr. C. Sierich. Despite the many hardships and adversities with which we had to contend in the past few years (the ongoing war between the armies, severe hardship and the decline in trade). The first school year has now come to an end with very pleasing results, thanks to the competition led by foreign schools: a boys' school run by the local French Catholic Nifüon, a girls' school run by the same Rifben under the direction of the French Catholic Swedes, a boys' and girls' school run by the Londen Mußen S riety and a boys' and girls' school run by an English private owner. A report on this was published in the magazine of the Allger memea Denischen Scholverruns zur Verderitung des Deurscheums im Uuslande in Bertin. It still seems to us that it would be a good idea not to drop this purely nationalistic approach, which has been upheld for a whole year under such difficult circumstances and with so many difficulties. However, the establishment of our own school board and the involvement of a new teacher have proved to be a necessary step towards securing the school's existence. As the funds to be provided here are not sufficient to achieve this goal, the help of our German nationals in this regard has been included in the last general communiqué, the undersigned board member hereby takes the liberty of making a polite request to all those who wish to contribute to the prosperity of the German language, which has been destroyed by the unhappiness of the situation.

From the German Emin Pasha Expedition. As is known, the German Emin Pasha expedition began its march into the interior in three detachments. The first division, led by Dr. Peters and Lieutenant v. Tiedemann, set out from Witu at the end of July 1889 and from Ngao at the beginning of August and reached Oda=Boru=Ruva in the second half of September, where it was still there on October 8; (cf. the report by Peters and the letter by v. Tiedemann in No. 1 of the Deutsche Kolonialzeitung). In the meantime, the onward march to the Kenya Mountains and Lake Baringo is said to have taken place. The second detachment under Captain Lieutenant (ret.) Rust left Ngao on September 18 and by mid-November had made it far up the Tana to the vicinity of Peters when the leader felt compelled to return due to illness. Mr. Rust has given more details of his journey in the very readable report which we published in No. 1 of this newspaper. Whether Dr. Peters took the supplies that Rust left behind for him on the upper Tana is not known at present. The third section was led by Mr. Ookar Borchert. He had to represent the interests of the expedition in the lawsuit pending before the English prize court in Sansidar concerning the confiscation of the Reera. As is well known, the trial ended with the acquittal of the Reera. Borchert was thus held back in Zanzibar until the end of August. He was only able to return to Lamu at the beginning of September. He submitted a report on his further experiences to the executive committee of the German Emin Pasha Committee, which we have forwarded for publication. Although the report does not contain any new facts of significance, it serves to supplement the travel accounts we have already mentioned above and proves once again the difficulties our courageous compatriots involved in the Emin Pasha expedition have to contend with in Africa. Borchert's report bears no date; it was posted in Lamu on January 3 and only arrived here on February 23. From the contents one must conclude that it was written in Kinakombe am Tana at the end of November or beginning of December last year. Mr. Borcher writes in it: In the second half of September I had finished putting together my expedition and travelled from Lamu via Mkonumbi-Fungasombo to the Tana region to Ngao. My only task at the moment was to quickly follow Dr. Peters and rejoin the main column. I had enough porters for this purpose and was well equipped. I could have rejoined Dr. Peters in four weeks at the latest. When I arrived in Ngao, I received the first letter from Captain Lieutenant Rust, which was very disruptive to my plans: "Due to a total lack of means of transportation, he had left about 110 loads in Ngao, which I would like to bring with me. I now had 160 loads to carry instead of 50. Well, I hoped to be able to place them in a dan, which I had bought in Lamu just in case, and which I wanted to have a Mr. Schlunke take by sea to the mouth of the Tana, then into the Tana Binein as far as Ngao. Mr. Schlunke had done this work a year before, he had then hunted elephants on the middle Tana and I had engaged him for the journey to
Korkoro. He was to guide the boat, I wanted to go by land and of course we wanted to meet in Ngao beforehand. I was there on time. There was no sign of Mr. Schlunke, only after about ten days of waiting did I receive a letter from him: "He had been shipwrecked on a sandbank near Kipini and had just saved his naked life by swimming to the beach; may I come quickly and help save him". Still busy reading this letter of misfortune, I see two Somalis coming down the Tana, they hand me a letter from Captain Lieutenant Rust from Kinakombe; he had had a terrible fire accident and was glad to have saved his life in the explosion of the ammunition, many exchange articles had been burnt, without replacements for them the expedition could not be carried out, I should get the burnt things back and then follow, he was with the rest to Dr. Peters. That same day I decided to return, but with a heavy heart, for I knew beforehand that, apart from the loss of a whole month of noble time, I would in any case forfeit my porters. The people had their usual advance pay, and there is a great danger of being disembarked when one returns home. I informed Captain Rust of all this. At the beginning of October, instead of going up the Tana, I went back via Witu to Kepini to help the shipwrecked Mr. Schlunke. After four days of hard work, with the help of 70 men, I got the Dan out of the sand and rescued the bales. The Dan had to be repaired for the journey and was no longer usable for my voyage. Fortunately, however, I managed to walk some Miaus (Kanns) in Kipini and handed over the Mians and rescued things to Mr. Schlunke with the order to take them via Kau up the Osi into the Beledsoni and Tana to Ngao. I myself marched back to Lamu via Mpekotoni=MkonumbiMansumarabu through the territory of the German Witn=Gesellschaft. After about ten days of work, I had bought the things lost in the fire, packed them into loads and was also lucky enough to have 30 porters. The prospects were good. But I had not reckoned with the landlord. On the morning of our departure, my men told me, through the mouth of my Heimann, who immediately afterwards entered the service of the English consul, "they were not going with me, they had certainly heard that I wanted to sell them to Dr. Peters, who wanted to make war with them." I negotiated with them for a whole day, trying kindness and force. Mr. Töppen and Mr. Dehnhardt tried to change their minds. For nothing! I got rid of all but 6 of my porters! Almost 40 men had run away. Now I had to have the purchased loads carried by water up the Osi-Beledsoni and Tana to Ngao. With the rest of my men I marched via Mkonumbi to Witu. In Witn I received the news: Dr. Peters and Lieutenant v. Tiedemann murdered. - Captain Rust seriously wounded by three spearmen in Massa! A messenger told me this in the presence of Mr. Töppen and the Sultan Fumobakari, "he had seen the bodies". - You can imagine what a state of mind the news put me in. I immediately made an agreement with Fumobakari: "If the news of the war is confirmed, he should give me 400 soldiers and I would hurry to the scene. To be sure of the news, I got on my stallion and rode to Ngao as quickly as possible, leaving in the morning, I was already there at 11 o'clock (42 kilometers. I arrived just in time, a messenger from Dr. Peters and Captain Rust had come with letters of the best wishes, hardly ever in my life have I been so pleased with news as this. On the same day I sent express messengers to Dehnhardt, Töppen and the Sultan, wrote to Zanzibar and had the rumors of the show denied. So my task was the same: to get 200 loads to Dr. Peters quickly. Unfortunately, Mr. Schlunke was not yet in Ngao with the things and Miaus,

Page 54

I left my horse with the friendly Neukirchen missionaries, got on a mian and was already at the mouth of the BeledsoniTana by noon the next day. I had my things brought to the Tana and then transported to Ngao, where I spent the night in the Vema (fortification and customs house of the Beledsoni Canal), belonging to the Sultan of Witn, which the English wanted to annex. On that very day, an Englishman with Kau= and Kipini Arabs was in the vicinity with the express intention of taking the Beledsoni by force. 50 Sultan's soldiers were in the boma. The Englishman intended to go back. A day later I drove down the east, slept in Kau and went back from there to Witu, where my men had stayed. I now marched from Witn to Ngao for the third time; my men, things and oarsmen were there, so I was able to get 200 loads to Dr. Peters in Kenya; but things were to turn out differently again! Two express messengers from Lamn, accompanied by askaris from the Lamu Wall, brought me their letters and dispatches addressed to Strandes (Hausing and Ko.) in Zanzibar, and I also received an official message from the Reichskommissariat: Stanley and Emin Pasha will arrive in Mpwapwa on the 20th of this month and will be on the coast in a few weeks. I was certainly accustomed to surprises of every kind with regard to our expedition, but it was and still is hardly possible for me to wean myself from the thought of no longer being able to carry out the work that has occupied all my thoughts and actions for a long time! - My entire and really painstakingly compiled plans had now been overturned again. For me it meant: just get the news to Dr. Peters quickly. I sent a dispatch to you: "Somali English non-German expedition blown up, Peters and companions safe and sound, established fortified station in Kenya. I hope to catch up with Kenya or Baringo in express marches. Borchert. As a commentary on this the following: The Kablalla=Somali overran an English expedition, organized by the Third East African Company, led by Mr. Smith. The purpose of the expedition was to establish a station on the Tana River in order to capture the ivory trade. The battle took place at Korkorro, 25 Somalis were shot dead, some English soldiers and all the porters escaped and the cargo was stolen. The expedition was broken up and Mr. Smith went back. The scare rumours about Dr. Peters originated from this incident. I deposited about 170 loads in Ngao and started my journey. In Kulessa I learned that there was a sick Msungu (white man) in Mitole, I rode over and met Captain Lieutenant Rust there in an extraordinarily sad situation. Hard by the Tana, under a low, miserable Negro barasa, almost bare of clothing, without shoes, in the most miserable posture, almost starving. in the strong pinnacle I find my poor comrade Captain Rust. Formerly the picture of strength and health, he now had the face of a child, the color of a dead man; he had been unconscious for ten days. The fever had brought him so low that he no longer had the energy to leave the place. No bed for weeks, no medicine and almost no food, his landlord, a cheeky, insolent Wapokomo chief, considered him a certain candidate for death; to speed up the process, he denied Rust any food. It was, as I said, high time I came. I took Rust into a mian, drove to Kulessa, gave him food and quinine and, after much reluctance, induced him to go to Germany via Rgao and Lamn to recover. I hope he succeeds, his health is very shaken!") From Kulessa I went on through Muinna, Ndura, Maroni, Nderani, Guano, Makere, Keradsa and in six days I was in Kinakombe, where I had to wait for Mr. Schlunke, who brought some things and some food by boat, without which I cannot travel as there is not a handful of food on the upper Tana from Massa to Bonini. It is certainly not my intention to recite jeremiads to you, but I consider it my duty to inform you that under the present circumstances the journey is extremely difficult for me, I lack all the favorable conditions for the journey. all the unfavorable ones are there! At the moment it is the rainy season, the path that Dr. Peters passed, the then dry river valley, is now a large swamp and lake, there is no other way, and I have neither the time nor the people to take it. Almost every day I have to march to the water's edge, on the very first day a donkey got stuck in the mud, when I reach the barra (steppe) I have no guide, all the people have run away; when I reach a village it is deserted. The worst thing that can happen is that I have no food. If I find people, they adopt a hostile attitude. 6 porters are all my wealth, of course I had to do without everything in my needs. My small loads include my camp bed, some scientific instruments, a bundle of stuff for me and barter items. My army consists of 6 Somalis. That is not impressive here. Yes, I wish I had an expedition of 60-80 men with shotguns, or a small cannon! I already had my first battle in Kinakombe. The Sultan Gulo, a great drunkard, refused to give me a man to take a letter to Mr. Schlunke, I went with my Somalis into the town, which is fortified all around by pallisades and has only two small gates. I was only a few steps away from the gate when there was an old war cry, the drunken Sultan and probably 4 to 500 Wapokomo, Wagalla, Wassanie and Waboni charged at me with their 7-foot-long spears, children howled. Women screamed (there are about 3-4000 people living in Kinakombe). I ordered my 6 Somalis to go back through the gate in good order and leave the Mausekalle. The last Somali unfortunately bumped into a Wapokomo woman in the gateway, *) According to the latter's report (Kolonialzeitung p. 8), the meeting between Borchert and Rust took place on November 22.
and it would soon have come to a catastrophe. The guys were serious about spearing me, I was ready with my double rifle and wanted to shoot, when at the last moment an ivory buyer from Kau threw himself between the attackers' spears and the barrel of my rifle. I was able to pass through the gate unhindered, where all my men were standing with 14 shotguns. I decided to go into my boma (fortification) and wait there. At 4 o'clock in the afternoon a parliamentarian arrived, peace was solemnly concluded and my wishes were granted. - Mr. Schlunke was attacked and robbed on the way by 60 Waboni. The Waboni were from Katawa, a place belonging to the Sultan of Witn. As you will be aware, Dr. Peters had a rendezvous with the Sultan Hujo in Oda=Boru=Ruva. The Sultan is said to have died Do not think that these obstacles and difficulties are in any way capable of having a consternating effect on me. No, wonderfully enough, I have never felt so well physically as I do here now. As long as I have been in Africa, I have not had the slightest ailment, despite the fact that I have certainly not lacked the greatest physical and mental efforts. I have never had a fever! Thank God! The abundance of game here is a great help to me in feeding my people and I have killed a lot of game. Among others, a large kidoko (river plerd), whose meat tastes excellent. I am now in an area where there are a lot of elephants. I hear lions every day. I haven't seen one yet, but the other evening a lion jumped at my stallion but didn't get him. The stallion ran away and I only got him back two days later. Through my domestic back and forth and my big hunting trips I had the opportunity to get to know the lower part of the Tana=Gegründlich - the area of the German Witu=Gesellschaft. I reserve my observations about the country and its people, culture, customs and traditions, soil composition, topographical and climatic conditions, etc., for a later time. The only thing I would like to mention now is that the soil conditions in the Tana region are the best imaginable, all the land is fertile, easy to cultivate and drain (alluvium). Every handful of soil is worth its weight in gold. Every tropical plant grows here, especially tobacco. There are also magnificent forests with valuable timber, the Tana itself is always navigable for small steamers as far as Massa, but in the short and long rainy seasons it is navigable as far as Hamese. The Tana region can certainly be recommended to planters, but there is one drawback which I must not conceal. There is a shortage of labor. But a solution could be found. A trading company would be able to make big deals in ivory. There is a lot of ivory in Kenya, in Korkorro (Oda=Born=Ruva). The English are naturally furious that our expedition has brought them into a region they thought they already owned. The fertile valley of the Tana is to them what the Nile region is to the Agppten. Tomorrow morning at 4 a.m. I will continue my hike; in 13-14 days of walking I hope to be at Kenya; if Dr. Peters is no longer there, but after Baringo, then I will give in. I don't think the latter is impossible, because I hear from Rust that Dr. Peters is in possession of the rescued exchange articles, and he has also put together a donkey caravan in Ukambani, as I am sure he knows. Well, he may be wherever he wants, I will and must catch up with him As our readers know, Mr. Borchert continued his march to the Kenya station despite all the difficulties, but did not meet Dr. Peters there; Peters and Tiedemann had already left the station forty days earlier - at the beginning of November - and had marched on to Lake Baringo. Borchert reported this by telegraph via Zanzibar after he had returned ill to Lamu on January 23. His sturdy health had not been able to withstand the tremendous exertions of the march. Incidentally, a letter recently received by the Emin Pasha Committee from Mr. Kurt Töppen in Lamu states that Borchert's condition is improving noticeably and that a further report from him can be expected soon. The Emin Pasha Committee has not received any direct news from Dr. Peters himself since the report of 8 October last year printed in No. 1 of the "Kolonialzeitung". The news first reported by the Reuters telegraph office from Mombassa on January 24 that two French missionaries had met Dr. Peters in Subaki has not been confirmed. Apparently the missionaries had not spoken to Peters, but to Borchert. This also emerges from a letter which a French bishop, Mr. de Courmont, recently wrote from Lamu on 20 January and in which it says: "Captain" Borchert will return to Lamu these days from Oda=Born=Ruva, where he found Dr. Peters' camp empty; Peters had already left some time before Borchert arrived; it was said in Nkone that Peters had gone to Ukamba to buy donkeys. No one knew where Peters was now, but it was certain that he was alive when he was said to be dead. - So said the French bishop who, it seems, had come to establish the French Catholic mission in Witulande and had traveled through the Tana for this purpose. The French missionaries only knew what Borchert had told them about Peters. From the oral retelling, however, the misunderstanding arose that they had spoken to Peters themselves, and this was then announced to the whole world by telegraph. (Continued in the supplement.)

Krab world view. As it is of great importance for us to penetrate into the intellectual life of our present enemies in East Africa for the further treatment of the Arab question, we believe that the following communication will arouse the interest of all those who are striving for a comprehensive solution: The letter by Professor Schweinfurth, which was published in the Deutsche Kolonialzeitung on February 1 of this year, contains some remarks on the fatalism of the Muslims and expects from it, or from the devotion to God caused by it, the gradual reconciliation of the antagonisms created by the Christian conquest In general, the nature of the so-called fatalism of the Muslims is misunderstood, for it is not only passive, but has often been actively documented in history by the highest heroic deeds. Our half-mocking, half-pitying smile at the devout Muslim who believes he is obeying the will of God by submitting to the doom that befalls him, not despondently but devotedly, would perhaps have closer objects to those whose restless haste results in roughly the same thing, self-destruction, only without that pious and reconciling trait. That the fatalism of the Muhammadans does not go too far, by the way, we have already experienced several times to our detriment, and it will be necessary to look for another common ground on which an agreement can possibly be reached before the Last Day. I do not intend to go into further detail here: a few words will suffice as a guideline. They are: strict justice, respect for the traditional, first of all for the religion of Islam and its institutions, friendly relations with respected and educated Mohammedans, which are by no means excessively difficult to establish, but require more tact and consideration for existing conditions than the present representatives of our race in those regions are inclined or able to show. I had made the acquaintance of Sheikh Abd ul Kadir Mohammed in Aden, which continued in a lively correspondence between us. He is the author of a popular work on Arabic inheritance law and is fond of chemical studies based on English textbooks, a language with which he is somewhat familiar. I owe him numerous clarifications in various fields of Jolam. Although he is also a thoroughly educated man in worldly matters, nothing is as close to his heart as his religion and the Koran. His last letter, which I am publishing below in a faithful translation, leaving untouched the assertions that repeatedly contradict our research, shows everywhere a genuine devotion to the subject and provides an apt illustration of the natural subordination of worldly science to that of religion among his landolim, as well as an example of true conscious submission to divine guidance, which is, however, quite far removed from blunt resignation. But the letter reads: Praise be to God alone! To our excellent friend, the Chowadja rc. rc. (After the usual greeting, it is not hidden from you that I saw from English newspapers how Ernest Benson published a book in London in which he explains that Islam is in truth one with Christianity, and that the learned people of the advanced German school are of the opinion that the teachings of the Koran are only the teachings of the written religion as it was prevalent, and that the influence of St. Paul became decisive. Paul's influence became decisive, that our Prophet became acquainted with the Christian traditions and adopted them, and that it is possible to learn about them by studying the Qur'an, excluding the rare ones that have come into existence since the year 33 after the Messiah. If they had said that the Iolam is the true religion and that anyone who wants to attain it must study the Qur'an, their statement would have been the truth itself, for they recognize the correctness of its teachings, only they attribute them to the written tradition. This is like a man finding in another man an object that resembles something he himself possessed, which he now claims for himself without any proof. In truth, Almighty God created the creatures and what they need for their happiness in this world and for the provision of the other. He sent down the Scriptures to Moses, the Gospel to Jesus, and the Qur'an to our Prophet, and He Who is Exalted says therein: "We sent down the Qur'an in confirmation of the previous Scriptures, that is, the Mosaic and the Gospels, and in support of them." This means that the Qur'an is the authority for the books that precede it, and that what contradicts it in these books is invalid. It is not surprising*) The passage is in Sura V. 52.
strange that our Prophet is an Arab and not one of the sons of Js=ael, for God can choose for His Messenger whom He wills from among His servants. As for the opinion of your scholars that the Qur'an is taken from your religious doctrine, it has no justification, but arises from the inability to grasp what can only be grasped by one who is under divine guidance and whose judgment is enlightened by God. For in fact the thoughts of your scholars are only concerned with the knowledge of this world, while they are unaware of the others, as God says:*) "They know the outward appearances of this world, but do not concern themselves with the other." Their thoughts are deeply absorbed in the affairs of this world and cannot be directed to what will do them good in the next. Would to God I knew how it was proved to them that our Prophet took lessons in the scriptural teachings and imitated them. Where was he when he studied them, who was his teacher, and how could he have translated them, since he was unlearned and could not even read or write Krabi? How then could he compile these teachings and laws, and when did he compile them? The truth is that our Prophet was unlearned and could neither read nor write his own language. But God taught him the science of the supernatural and made him acquainted with the secrets of His wisdom. Is this miracle not yet sufficient for you in a man who does not know the language of other people, much less can transmit their teachings and laws and arrange and compile them? In this age, when civilization has spread and the learning of foreign languages has become so easy, would not one of the many learned people have produced something like the Qur'an, or compiled the lives of Islam and its laws! But despite the abundance of books and their cheap production by printing, they cannot imitate even a small chapter of the Qur'an. Indeed, eloquent men among the Arabs and their poets in the time of ignorance. when they opposed the Prophet, and later eloquent unbelievers tried their utmost to create something similar to the Qur'an, but succeeded, and they recognized that it contains neither poetry nor prose, but a language, clear, eloquent, of beautiful construction, the like of which is beyond human power to produce, and its style as well as its wording are the greatest miracle, as the most eloquent Arabs, who are better acquainted with their language than the Europeans, have acknowledged. Indeed, our Qur'an contains the teachings we needed for our guidance and welfare in our worldly and religious affairs. It teaches us to do good and to avoid evil, it recommends what is reasonable and just, as well as charity and assistance and mercy for the oppressed, it forbids what is unreasonable, immoral, tyranny, oppression. Fornication, drunkenness, gambling and everything whose use is harmful and which could harm another. Cleanliness is a part of our faith and you have seen for yourself that the middle class of Muslims here are cleaner than those of your civilized people. We have a Book which is unchangeable, which contains the commandments of God, who knows what is harmful to His creatures and what is good for them, and He has guided us well with it in our religious and spiritual relationships. It has worked from the time of our prophet to the present day and continues to spread without the help of missionaries, and people's hearts are filled with it. You have legislative assemblies which impose heavy restrictions and which do not stop laboring day and night to make laws, but only for the worldly welfare of your country. And often, when they have made a law, it is not long before they discover that it is harmful; then they change it and make another law, and continue to do so at all times. But our Qur'an is a divine, unchangeable doctrine, and its injunctions are all useful and reasonable, if you look at it and its opinions with a sense of justice. Its opinions and views are different, as the poet says: Often the eye misjudges the sunlight because of inflammation of the eye, often the mouth misjudges the taste of water because of illness. I have written this in haste. So forgive me and send me a satisfactory answer soon. With Salem and s. Written Aden, January 21, 1890, your friend Abdul Kadir Muhammed. So much for the letter. I leave untouched the greater or lesser weight of the reasons given and only note that they are shared quite equally by the educated and the uneducated, and that all are equally concerned with the defense of the divine mission of their Prophet and the truth of the religion revealed through him. We have no right to reject a religious and moral law which differs from our own, because it sprang from a foreign soil and was intended for other classes of men, and thus offend the most sacred feelings of those whom we wish to make our friends.

must be the focus of attention. The agitation is based on the correct consideration that the most important thing is to lay a sufficiently firm foundation on which the building can then be erected. However, it is often noticeable that a number of like-minded people confuse the two concepts, consider the foundation to be the most important and, glad of the success they have achieved, do not do any more to build up the work. When the agitation has reached wider circles and the newspapers take up the cause they have championed, they are completely satisfied and in their short-sightedness overlook the fact that continued work is necessary to crown the work. Anyone who has paid any attention to our colonies knows that, in the early stages of their development, they are no more than experimental plants, that almost everything still needs to be done in terms of colonization technology, that the more intensively one deals with them, the greater the difficulties that arise which must be overcome, that day after day we are faced with new puzzles, the solution of which is the task of the association's activities. We only want to touch on one question here, which, appreciated by Englishmen and Americans in all its importance, has so far met with little sympathy in the circles of colonial friends, but has recently gained in importance for us as well: the question of medical missions for the German colonies The idea of using and utilizing Christian doctors and their art in the Protestant mission fields first took on a more definite form among the practical Americans at the beginning of the second third of our century. It was also they who gave the impetus for the foundation of the first medical missionary society in Europe, which was soon followed by a whole number of others, so that today this missionary activity has received a quite enormous expansion. We cannot go into the individual societies here, but refer those who are interested in the subject to an exhaustive work by the recently deceased Professor Christlieb. *) Towards the end of 1887, there were already 264-268 doctors with doctorates from medical faculties working at Protestant missionary stations among pagans and Mohamedans, almost all in the service of Protestant missionary societies, some also in connection with the medical missionary societies founded some time ago or also with women's missionary societies, only a few completely independently. In recent years, the number of missionaries has grown to such an extent that the French Catholics feel constrained by the propaganda of the Protestants and, as a result of a lecture by Le Roy de Méricourt at the Académie de Paris on February 26 of this year, a society was formed in France with the aim of creating hospitals and dispensaries (clinics and pharmacies, all of which are summarized in the English word dispensary), since the advantage that the doctor has over other missionaries through his work was generally recognized. The Oeuvre médicale missionnaire, which wants to work in Algiers and in the far east, where the Protestant influence has increased enormously, seems to be developing quite satisfactorily. The "White Fathers" of Algiers have also established a very interesting institute on the island of Malta. Slave children ransomed in the interior of Africa are taken in there, taught languages, mathematics and natural sciences and then sent to university to study medicine. In a memorandum sent to the Africa Association of German Catholics with a request for support, it says about their effectiveness: "Once doctors, they accompany the missionaries to Central Africa, marry there and use their knowledge among the savages. Those who know the extraordinary influence that such doctors exert on the black tribes can easily explain the benefits that can be derived from this institution for the Christian education of Africa. The first three doctors we trained in this way are active in the Tanganyika mission. Msgr. Bridoux, who had the good fortune last year to accompany these missionaries of a new kind, speaks very highly of their services." As we note in passing, this mission intends to "re-establish the previously flourishing vicariates in Unianiembe and Victoria-Nyanza, which are located on German territory. The aim is to promote the cause of Christianity and the cause of Germany". So far, German missionary circles have not yet taken up the cause *) Medical missions. By Therder Christlieb.

No. 5. the necessary attention, neither for the activities in the countries of Jolam, nor in the German colonies, if one disregards the important German deaconess work in the Orient. Even if the deaconesses are not academically educated doctors, they are trained nurses in hospitals and deaconess teaching homes, who, alongside the teaching nurses in schools and orphanages, perform immensely important pioneering services for the Protestant mission, and whose silent work is increasingly recognized by Christians and Mohammedans, especially as it is usually older than that of English female doctors. In Alexandria. Cairo, Jerusalem, Beirut, Smyrna and Constantinople, the sisters are active in a variety of ways. The German Order of St. John has also had a hospital in Beirut since 1867 and is very beneficial. But actual missionary doctors, who are not only supposed to heal but also evangelize, are not connected with these institutions. The German deaconess work in the Berlin East African mission, on the other hand, is directly serving the heathen mission, and a deaconess house is being prepared for West Africa in Ho (Slave Coast, area of the Bremen mission). The Knaak Women's Association for China has sent missionary doctors to Hong Kong, the Basel Missionary Society in Aburi on the Gold Coast, in Kalikut and probably now also in China, as has the Rhenish Mission in Barmen), but the number of German doctors is still small in relation to the general missionary activity, although medical activity undoubtedly benefits the general missionary interests in a surprising way. What a great field of work is still offered by our colonies, whose natives are on a lower level than the peoples of the East, where the mission is concerned with planting the foundations of Christian morality, but for the colonial politicians it is to solve the enormously important native question in the sense that the natives gradually appropriate German culture to a certain degree? If we focus above all on the activities of the mission, it is because the medical activities fit most easily into the framework of their endeavors and the missions can have a lasting effect on the visitors to the clinics. In addition, however, the activities of lay doctors on the part of the government and colonial societies should not be underestimated. Dr. Kohlstock recently reported that in the wards on the coast, where the first annual report of the first Dene medical mission in China was published, the town of Tungkun (Kwankung Province), with a population of over 300,000, was chosen as the location for the hospital, which was opened at the beginning of April 1868 under the direction of Dr. F. Kuhne. By the end of 1888, 4100 patients had used the public consultations and 40 operations, some of them serious, had been carried out with favorable results. The great successes which the numerous hospitals assigned to the English and American missions have had during the last few years clearly indicate that among the many efforts to spread European culture and civilization in China, medical efficiency in connection with missionary work occupies one of the most prominent positions. A few glimpses of the medical experiments of the native doctors and the disheartening sanitary conditions of the Chinese best show the class wound on the Chinese people's body that cries out for healing. As the report notes, apart from the Imperial Medical Academy in Peking for the sole use of His Majesty and the Grand Duke, there is not a single medical school in the entire great empire. Anyone can practise the art of healing with very little knowledge gleaned from a few books. Not to mention the charlatans among the poorer classes and the rural population, who draw their wisdom from tradition and a carefully guarded secret doctrine of remedies. There is a complete lack of knowledge in surgery, obstetrics, childhood diseases, ophthalmology and protective measures in the event of an outbreak of an epidemic *) Merensky says in a recently published brochure: "What do the experiences of other peoples who have attempted colonization in Africa teach us?" (Berlin, 1890, published by M. L. Matthies We believe that native policy is by far the most important branch of all colonizing activity in our African colonial territories. Almost everything for the future depends on the manner and nature in which the native question is solved there. In South-West Africa the land is not fertile enough to support an Enropean population of any great number. In Togoland and Cameroon, the climate will in all probability not permit the formation and development of a European colonial population; in East Africa there are vast stretches of land where the same conditions will prevent the settlement of faraway peoples. However, even if white colonists are able to settle and remain in individual landscapes, the country will remain largely inhabited by blacks. The political success of our efforts depends on whether these natives become quiet, loyal, benevolent subjects of Germany, and the economic success of our colonial ventures depends on whether they become industrious, productive workers and cattle breeders. For the future of Africa and the European colonies in Africa will be determined by the development of the African natives.

doctors were available, polyclinics had been set up where indigent natives were treated free of charge and those with means were treated for a small fee, and that this institution was proving successful. He himself was able to relate a characteristic case in which he had won the lasting gratitude of a native through a minor operation, which had greatly benefited German interests. German colonization must become cultivational colonization on the highest scale and must begin in all areas if it wants to create something lasting and effective under the present circumstances, when the natives are beginning to become more self-confident here and there, without making too great sacrifices later on. Because of his ability to assimilate, the Negro will not share the fate of other inferior races which disappeared before the penetration of civilization; he has a special task in the development of world history. It cannot be our task to Europeanize the Negro; we must only educate him to the ability to do justice to his tasks towards mankind. In the recognized correct principle now. "Let each and every age help to evangelize and cultivate the world with what has been given to it." We Europeans, who have already enjoyed the blessings of a written culture in all areas of state and social life for centuries, have the duty, from the standpoint of humanity, to impart these advantages to those peoples who still lack them. The transportation of freed slaves.*) (Continuation instead of conclusion. However, Botschabelo is not a settlement of freed slaves, but was founded by the Berlin Missionary Society as a refuge for fugitive Africans. But the difficult task of creating a community of blacks that would bring about the moral-religious and economic education of the individual, while at the same time maintaining itself and possibly generating surpluses - this task was solved incomparably well in Botschabelo. However, there were favorable circumstances at play: the unique energy and insight of the founder, the relatively high cultural level of the Bassuto, who formed the basis of the population, and finally the insecurity of the surrounding country, which required firm cohesion. On the other hand, however, there were also considerable difficulties, especially in the reclamation of the land; and it may well be said that the advantages just mentioned may have justified the viability of the colony, but by no means the brilliant successes that Merensky sast achieved in every respect. A reading of his "Memoirs" can hardly leave one in any doubt that the prosperity of Botsabelo is due in large part to the peculiar type of economic management and communal constitution introduced by the leader, who was equipped with an unusual knowledge of African nature. Botschabelo is a so-called Instituk, i.e. a station situated on land belonging to a missionary society. The latter collects rent from the inhabitants and practises cultivation according to laws agreed with them. A tithe is levied from the annual rent of maize and grain, the main products of Botschabelo: (Memoirs p. 245, 330; Deutsche KolonialZeitung 1889 No. 28, 29, 33). The exemplary laws for the inhabitants state eo: (3) "The masters of the land are the great teachers beyond the sea; it belongs to them, for they have bought it from the peasants. All orders that come from them are laws of this community of people. - (4) The missionaries who are employed by them are the shepherds of this community in their place. Therefore, no one may build or farm or cut wood without the permission of the missionaries. - (5) The appointed elders (blacks) shall supervise the people to see that they obey the laws and shall administer justice. People who transgress will be judged by the assembly of elders. The common people shall not rule, but shall hear and obey for God's sake, for the elders must be honored. - (6) Offenses that shall be severely punished are: Theft committed among themselves and against peasants, fornication, resisting the elders. Punishment for this is beating and expulsion from the place, or another severe punishment, depending on the judgment of the elders.(7) Lesser punishment is payment of fines. - (8) Fines do not belong to a single man, but are kept by the one who is appointed to ensure that they benefit the whole community *) Abridged copy of a memorandum written on behalf of Commission V of the German Colonial Society.
bring. - (10) Buildings for church and school are provided by the people. In addition, on one day of each month they will do the work that the missionary instructs them to do. This is the constitution of Botschabelo. Its great advantage lies in the fact that it has preserved the patriarchal regiment of the chief, or elder, familiar to the African, with certain restrictions and without prejudice to the overall direction by the white man. The economic system, however - the black man is obliged to pay tithes as a tenant - is such that the black man's desire for independence is taken into account and yet at the same time he is forced to produce more than his livelihood requires. We will have to come back to Botschabelo several times. The Brethren community in Kasserland proceeded in a similar way, although by no means as systematically; however, the reports we have on this are too general to allow us to form any definite opinions. (Cf. Miss. sheet from the Brethren congregation 1863 p. 85, 1849 p. 39, 1867 p. 13, 1868 p. 182 etc.) B. Proposals. The consideration of earlier experiments, which may be concluded herewith, yields a number of significant pointers. But it would be greatly overestimating their value to draw up a definite plan of practical procedure on this basis alone. Rather, such a plan must also require a very thorough examination of the East African situation, insofar as it is relevant to our question. Since this examination has not yet been undertaken and, if it is to yield reliable results, cannot be carried out in any other way than by one or more experts on the spot, the proposals that we will make below can only claim a very limited degree of validity. Insofar as the freed slaves are suitable for military service, nothing will stand in the way of their recruitment into the East African protection force; we have noted above that the British have had quite good experiences in West Africa. Apart from this possibility, as long as the German mission in East Africa has not gained a firm foothold, there are only two ways to accommodate them: Transfer to German plantation stations and the establishment of a special settlement of freed slaves. In the former case, we are faced with the difficult problem of combining Negro education and plantation economy in a way that is at least approximately favorable for both parties. The "apprenticeship contracts" used by the English are not exemplary; nor can the service regulations in force in Transvaal, although excellent in their nature, be readily applied to our task. Rather, it will require a careful study of the current labor conditions in East Africa and extensive negotiations with the trading companies working there if really sound contracts are to be achieved. However, there can hardly be any doubt about two points. The contract will have to bind the freed slave to the station in question for a certain number of years under threat of severe punishment - the black's own interests and those of the station demand it - and the employer must undertake to give each black, or each family, a small plot of land for their own use, which must be located in the immediate vicinity of the plantation and must be suitable in terms of size and yield to grow the necessary food. Only in this way will it be possible to gradually educate the black man to a certain economic independence and induce him to remain voluntarily at the station. An even stronger incentive to remain permanently would be if the black man were given the time and opportunity to produce on this plot of land beyond the extent necessary for subsistence, with permission to dispose of the harvest at will. If, among the West Indian colonies, Barbadoes has suffered the least from the emancipation of the Reger slaves, the main reason for this is to be found in the fact that the plantation owners there have regulated their relationship with the emancipated slaves in a very sensible manner and have actually encouraged them to operate the lucrative sugar cane ban on the land given to them in addition to growing the necessary food. (Blaub. 1859 Vol. XXI No. 42, 55, 97, etc.; Holtzendorff, die brit. Kolonien 1871 p. 8 ff. As far as the establishment of a special settlement of freed slaves is concerned, the experience gained in earlier attempts clearly points to three cardinal points on which the success of such an enterprise will primarily depend. It is necessary to determine 1. what kind of economic enterprise, 2. what kind of civil order, and 3. what kind of place would be the most suitable.

guarantee for a sustainable education of the black and for the profitability of the company. With regard to the economic enterprise, the two extremes would be: plantation work or the Sierra=Leonite's unconstrained and performance-free economy. There is no need to say that we would not get very far with the latter. The success of the Catholic mission in Bagamoyo could be cited in favor of the former, had it not been for the extremely favorable circumstance mentioned above that the mission had raised most of its plantation workers. But there is another example of plantation economy with freed slaves, which is very instructive and therefore requires detailed discussion: we mean the history of the West Indian plantations after the introduction of emancipation. The extensive source material provided by the Blue Books, as well as private and missionary reports (e.g. Madden, Twelve Monthe Resid. in the West Indies 1835; Capadose, Sixteen Years in the West Indies 1845; Gurney, Winter in the West Indies 1841; also the missionary journal of the Brethren Church) has not yet received sufficient scholarly treatment (a start in this respect: Abeken, amerik. Regersklaverei und Emanzipation, Berlin 1847); the testimonies, even the official ones, contradict each other to such an extent that it is extremely difficult to work one's way through to certain views. What is beyond doubt, however, is the path taken by the English government and its final results. The resolution passed by Parliament on June 12, 1833, which ordered the abolition of slavery, was followed by emancipation laws in the individual colonies, which, agreeing in their main features and differing only in details, established the rights and duties of the emancipated slave vis-à-vis his former master. They are summarized in the Blue Book of 1835 Volume 50 (cf. Pauli, Gesch. Englands II p. 203; Abeken op. cit. 53-82). In order to prevent the serious damage that was feared from an immediate unconditional emancipation, a 7-year so-called apprenticeship period was set for the previous field slaves, which they were to endure in the service of their previous master. The time during which they were obliged to work on his plantation was set at only 45 hours a week. The principal, on the other hand, was obliged to feed, clothe and lodge the apprentice; if there were 40 or more apprentices, he had to employ a doctor, whose orders he had to follow unconditionally. However, there are several ways in which the principal can decide how to feed and clothe the apprentices. In several colonies, the prescribed clothing could be replaced by exemption from work or payment of money, and as far as food was concerned, this could be provided either entirely by handing out the prescribed foodstuffs, or by giving only the meat diet and leaving the apprentice a piece of land to cultivate with the necessary seeds and tools for the production of vegetarian food. In both cases, however, money may be given in lieu of food. The land to be given in the second case should not be too far away from the apprentice's home (usually a maximum of 2 miles) and should be suitable, both quantitatively and qualitatively, to produce what is necessary for his livelihood. To do this, he must be given a certain number of days off from the statutory working hours (45 hours a week) - the provisions vary in the individual colonies from 11 to 26 days for the whole year. In most colonies, however, this time off could be replaced by monetary payment if the principal and apprentice concluded a contract to this effect. This system did not fulfill the purpose for which it was created, to save the West Indian plantation economy from ruin. The interest of the plantation owner ran directly counter to that of the freed slave: and yet both interests were to be taken into account. The way in which this union took place did not have the desired success for either the one or the other. The reduction of the working hours in the plantation to 7½ hours a day made it impossible, as the blue books of the years in question show, to maintain the business at its former level; for the apprentice, however, it was by no means sufficient to allow him time to really successfully cultivate the piece of land assigned to him, which, moreover, was perhaps at a considerable distance from his home. A certain short-sightedness in the enactment of these emancipation laws cannot be denied. In all probability, it would have been better to accept a considerable reduction in plantation production as the lesser evil and to give the black man the opportunity to engage in an economic activity that could really tie him permanently to the plantation. However, even after the end of the apprenticeship period, which was subsequently limited to four years, the conditions in this respect remained such that one can hardly be surprised at the mass exodus from the plantations. The emancipated man was allowed to continue to use the house and land assigned to him during the apprenticeship period without paying a pension, but he had to devote almost all his labor to the plantation at a wage that was 1 to ½ times less than the usual wage; this minus was regarded as the equivalent of a pension. In addition, the lease could be terminated at any moment. The unsoundness of this system gradually led to certain modifications, but in the main it still existed on most West Indian plantations in 1858. (Cf. in particular the Blue Book of 1859 Vol. XXI No. 42, 55, 57, etc. The natural consequence was that the great majority of the completely freed slaves stopped working on the plantations. If they had saved something during their apprenticeship, they cultivated individually or joined together to buy plantations, but, unaccustomed to forced labor and anxious for the quickest possible profit, they seldom made more than was sufficient for the most basic needs; many abandoned themselves to vagabondage (Blaub. l.c.; Miss.=Blatt s. d. Brüdergemeinde 19 p. 55; 13 p. 5; 14 p. 61; 38 p. 20 ff. 135 et al.). The plantation business suffered the most serious damage everywhere, from which it recovered only very slowly despite the introduction of coolies and freed Africans. Conditions remained relatively favorable only on the smaller, densely populated islands, where it was very difficult for the emancipated people to buy their own land. These events had to be discussed in detail, as they are clear evidence of the difficulty of operating a plantation economy with freed slaves in such a way that the profitability of the enterprise is ensured and at the same time a satisfactory existence is achieved for the workers. We shall not be able to do without the plantation economy altogether in Africa, and where it is necessary, let the example of Barbadoes be followed: But for a settlement of freed slaves, a system must be chosen that opens up a brighter perspective The system of Botschabelo, which has proven itself in every respect for almost 25 years, is very significant that Reichard, certainly a sober assessor of all missionary works, also wants to see the economic operation of Botschabelo applied to the task at hand (Deutsche Kolonialzeitung 1889 No. 33), with the difference, however, that after completing a three-year apprenticeship, the freedman actually receives a right of ownership to the land, which was initially only transferred to him for use. In Botschabelo the black man remains a tenant forever: the sole owner of the land is the missionary society, to which he has to pay the tithe of the harvest. This prevents the danger of later alienation of the property - a common occurrence in Sierra Leone. Perhaps it is therefore a good idea to follow the example of Botschabelo in this respect too. But in the end this question is of secondary importance: if only the Botschabelo system is applied in the main. It has the unique advantage that it fully satisfies the African's instinct for independence and yet at the same time firmly compels him to do proper work by demanding the payment of tithes. Furthermore, as far as compulsory labor for public works is concerned, the black man seems to have an insurmountable antipathy towards this; according to an oral report by Merensky, it was difficult for him to win over the otherwise extremely willing Botschabelo people for even one day a month. So Reichard's estimate of two days' service a week is perhaps a little too high. There is only one point where a modification of this system seems appropriate for the present purpose. There they were Bassutos, people from a capable tribe that was relatively advanced in agriculture, whereas here we have to reckon at least in part with elements that do not have such favorable premises. It is therefore highly recommended that our colonists be given an apprenticeship period of several years, during which their work in agriculture is subject to particularly careful supervision. The latter will only have the desired success if it is free of all pettiness and pedantry, but in serious cases of laziness is supported by emphatic punishment, preferably forced labor, which the experienced missionary Bohner (Hauptaufgaben einer westafrikanischen Kolonialregierung. 1889) recommends as the most effective form of punishment. *) Deterred by the experiences of the English, emancipation in the Dutch colonies refrained from an "apprenticeship period" and replaced it with 10 years of state supervision. The success was not much more favorable. The most recent emancipation provisions, those of Brazil, also have no apprenticeship period, but are otherwise very similar to the English ones (Blaub. 1886. Slaro-Trade p. 46 ff.).

Page 59

In addition, the apprentice would have to be supported and reprimanded wherever he showed ineptitude and inexperience. This would be an apprenticeship in the best sense of the word, as valuable for the black man himself as for the prosperity of the whole enterprise. Of course, it cannot be done without a certain amount of coercion. It is a sign of poor insight when Warneck (Position of the Protestant Mission on the Question of Slavery) anxiously wants to avoid the use of any form of forced labor. If the education of blacks is necessary at all - which Warneck will not deny - it will, like all education, not be able to do without certain means of coercion, and the degree of coercion will have to be proportional to the degree of need for education. Where the complete lack of freedom with regard to work, which according to Warneck seems to belong to the ideal of a slave colony, leads - this has been sufficiently experienced in the case of the Sierra Leonite: either he led an idle life of the worst kind on his freehold, or he moved to the city to live and trade here, but in both cases an abomination before God and man. We will avoid such dangers for the economic and moral development of our black man by forcing him to remain as an apprentice for a certain period of time where we have placed him. We want him to enjoy farming during this time so that he can stay with it later without being forced. This is a temporary restriction of personal freedom, no worse than the one we apply every day at school and in the army. Warneck has particular respect for the slander of slave traders when we use any kind of coercion in relation to work. But is it not quite indifferent how our action will be judged from this side! The slave trader will never and never praise a practical anti-slavery society, which is the real poison against his trade, no matter how it proceeds in detail. The second precondition on which the prosperity of our settlement will depend is a proper civil order, as mentioned above. Here, too, Sierra Leone is a warning example that could hardly be more drastic. By grafting English citizenship on the black journeymen, who had perhaps come from the interior only a few months before,) a degree of vanity and self-conceit was developed in the immature minds which made any moral progress illusory from the outset. Although himself despised all along the west coast of Africa, the Sierra=Leonite nevertheless looks haughtily down on the European, by no means excluding the Englishman. It was a similar blunder that the emancipation provisions abruptly replaced slavery with a strictly enforced legal relationship between exher and ex-slave, with precise delimitation of the rights and duties of both parties; that they also suddenly reduced the master's power of punishment, which had previously been almost unlimited, to a mere gully and ordered cumbersome court proceedings for every minor offense committed by the ex-slave. (Blaub. 1855 vol. 50 and the following years.) With the loss of the power of punishment, the principal lost a good part of the necessary respect, and among the blacks a foolish arrogance was the natural consequence. The principle that in the education of Africans the greatest progress is made when new and strange things, which will always exert a confusing influence, are kept as far away as possible, when the old traditional institutions and views are not only spared but even supported, unless there are irreconcilable contradictions with Christian culture?) - this principle is immediately obvious to us today, since it has been so brilliantly confirmed by Botschabelo, and yet it took a long period of error before it was accepted. Its full practical significance, however, will only become apparent when it comes to the economic education of entire tribes; but even for the present, more limited task, its importance should not be underestimated. As we saw above, Merensky took the patriarchal regiment of the chiefs and sex elders familiar to Africans as the basis of the community order: they are the overseers of the people and arbitrators for all disputes among the blacks; but most offenses are also subject to their judgment. As far as possible, the tribal tradition is maintained in the legal views, the court proceedings and the type of punishment. In our case, these relationships will not be as simple as in Botschabelo, but it may be a good idea to *) Conscientious doubts expressly expressed in a decree of August 20, 1853, see Stato Papers 1852 -53 p. 715 f. Cf. the criticism of Duttenhoser, Emancipation of the Reger 1855, as well as the reasonable suggestions of Holud, Einged.=Frage Südafrikas p. 10 f., 41 f. Cf. Merensky: "Wie erziehl man den Reger". 1886, p. 10.
to create them in the future, i.e. to organize the reger families to be settled into clans and to place an elder of our choice in front of each clan. Reichard, in his essay cited several times, speaks of the patriarchal regiment of the white governor. Such a regime must of course exist, but, as the development of Botschabelo shows, it can be easily combined with the police and judicial authority of the elders. The sovereignty of the white man will remain all the stronger the less often he is compelled to make use of it. Furthermore, it is very doubtful whether even a man who is very familiar with African conditions can make the right judgment and treatment of black people everywhere. Much disgruntlement and confusion among the blacks will be avoided and the governor will be spared a good deal of petty, tiresome work if the police and law are administered by native Africans, who must of course be reliable, tried and tested people and, moreover, be subject to the governor's supervision. The recruitment of these "elders" would only be a matter for the governor. It is interesting to note how the English, in their latest civilization plans, refer very emphatically both to an extensive utilization of natives (especially sons of chiefs) and to the extensive preservation of existing institutions; (cf. W. Allen, Narrative of the Exped. to the River Niger, and Carke, Cardinal Lavigerie and the Afr. Slave-Trade. 1889 p. 352 ff.) The fact that our governor himself must be a man thoroughly experienced in the treatment of Africans does not need to be mentioned Merenoly's suggestion to get him from the Germans of South Africa has much in its favor. Our first concern here was to establish the most important aspects. Many individual aspects will depend on the location and other circumstances that cannot yet be taken into account. However, one requirement must already be stated here: that the selection of the first settlers, whether they be slaves freed by our cruisers or ceded by Arabs in exchange for compensation, should be a very cautious one. Especially for the beginning, it would be extremely important to have only people with whom, according to human calculation, we can expect our efforts to be successful. The English have never thought of this in their attempts. It will also be well to see that we do not end up with a motley mixture of all kinds of tribes. Dao was one of the ills that afflicted Sierra Leone, and the unity of the tribe was a great advantage for the development of the Botschabelo station. It would be very desirable, but probably not easy to realize, if the people all belonged to the same tribe or at least closely related tribes. Incidentally, it is clear that the beginning must be made with as small a number as possible. Dr. Friedrich Back. should not go much beyond the 100 adults that Reichard considers absolutely necessary for the defense of the settlement. (Conclusion follows.) Correspondence. The new pressure on the South African Free States. The head of the Transvaal Republic, Mr. Paul Krüger, has, according to the last wire report from South Africa, raised a warning cry which confirms all that we have repeatedly expressed in this paper for some time. In the issue of January 18, we wrote: "Some think with Lady Feederick Cavendisy, or those who are behind her, that one should not be too reluctant to make a concession to the South African Republic, since the enormous increase in English immigration there will soon put an end to that Free State anyway, so that Trausvaal and Swafi=land will one day be won with one and the same blow. The new electoral law in the Suoafrican Republic stipulates a five-year residence period for obtaining citizenship. But five years pass quickly. For a number of gold diggers, they will soon have expired anyway. This makes it all the more urgent to supply the non-German Transvaal people, who have maintained their independent free state, with a tribally related supply as quickly and as extensively as possible." In a speech, the most senior official of the Dutch polity sharply denounced the danger threatening his country's constitution. Mr. Paul Krüger points to the increasing flood of foreign gold seekers and suggests that the last barrier can only be found in the establishment of a double People's Council or House of Representatives, one of which would represent the Low German Boers, the other the foreigners who have come in and who desire the right to vote. There is no doubt that his plan is to give the former the final decision in matters of legislation, thus making it a kind of Oder House. Mr. Krüger spoke about the current five-year period, after which the English and other immigrants will receive citizenship under the new law anyway, almost in the same cautionary tones.

words, as was the case in our presentation. For easily understandable reasons, he did not want to go into more detail about the pending plans to eliminate the ever-increasing danger. Of course, the supply of a tribally related supply for the oppressed population of Transvaal is now made more difficult by the fact that the inhabitants there, who are of Dutch descent and who simply believe in the Bible, adhere strictly to Protestantism and do not want a Catholic addition. This excludes Belgium, although almost three-quarters of it consists of Low German-speaking Flemings. However, Holland, where at least the majority is Protestant, and Lower Germany, with its overwhelming majority of the same faith, must be given priority. Time is pressing. Will it still be possible to avert the disaster threatening the South African Republic? Perhaps the magnitude of the danger can best be seen from an essay recently published in the "Fortnightly Review" on "The Swafiland Question" by Sir Hercules Rodinson, the former English Governor of the Cape Settlement and Chief Plenipotentiary in South Africa. He has more than once been singled out by us as one of those who opposed the anti-Boer activities of the Mackenzie group and wanted the right of self-government, the tribal feeling and the whole character of the population of Dutch blood to be protected. In the above-mentioned treatise, however, he now also says in a striking manner about the annexation of the Trausvaal Republic to the English Empire, which was violently carried out in 1877 and later reversed: "In general, our mistakes and failures in South Africa are due to our habit of delaying matters for too long or not proceeding in good time. In this case, however, the mistake was due to our impatience and premature action. If our plenipotentiary had not been in such a hurry, the Transvaal government and Bolksrat would have sunk to their knees before us in a few months and formally asked us to take over their country. Then, in all probability, there would have been no Madschuba and no restitution, and the country - the richest in South Africa - would be ours today. It is unnecessary to go into the misrepresentation contained in this account. Suffice it to point out that if even a man like Sir Hercules Robinson speaks like this today, the conquering party of the Mackenzie Great Afrikaners can only feel emboldened to get back at the Trausvaal Free State. Incidentally, Ser H. Robinson informs us that it was he who in 1884, when the treaty with the heads of government of the South African Republic was signed in London, had it inserted in Ad Section II: if necessary, an English plenipotentiary should be appointed on the eastern (as well as on the western) border of the Transvaal in order to counter any attempted advance there by the citizens of the Republic. The word "east" - he writes - was not in the original draft. But I foresaw that if the door in the west to Betschuana=Land were closed to the restless wandering spirits of the Transvaal, they would seek an exit to the east, to Zulu=Land and Swazi=Land. I had difficulty getting the word "east" inserted into Section II. Eventually the government relented, but did not want to make a cut beyond that, i.e. not actually place a plenipotentiary with a small police force on the eastern frontier, as had been approved in the west for Bethsnana Land. From these remarks it will already be seen how even one of the more unprejudiced men is in favor of the desire of the South African Republic to gain access to the sea; which might seem understandable enough to a sea nation like the English, which stretches out its trident on all seas. In the further course, Sir H. Robinson gives a different figure for the Swazi population than that recently given by the Great African party. He does not put it at 60,000, but at 150,000, of whom 25,000 are warriors. Quite contrary to the previous statements, he presents the number of English settlers in Swazi land as the majority among the whites. However, this does not seem to reflect the well-known fact that the majority of the whites did not wish to join the English Empire, but the Transvaal Free State. Moreover, Sir H. Robinson himself declares that, according to the whole state of affairs, there is nothing left but to annex Swafi=land either to England or to the South African Republic; England has no access to the country and is therefore unable to carry this out; the South African Republic is inclined to take over the country, and England has no right to enviously contaminate her food in the crib. It is worth noting that England has no access to Swazi land. It has been suggested that there is such access from Zulu land, by a route which is only open for part of the year. We have on a former occasion declared this to be incorrect; and our statement is now corroborated both by the statement of Sir H. Robinson, and by the cartoon which he has appended to illustrate his treatise. "If Swast=land," he writes, "were in our hands under these circumstances, we should find ourselves in the position of a man who has large estates without a right of way leading to them, while the natural access to them leads over the land of an unfriendly neighbor. I therefore come to the conclusion that if the independence of the Swaft cannot be maintained, the best thing to do is to allow the land to be taken over by the South African Republic under certain conditions. Here Sir H. Robinson emphasizes the desire that a number of appropriate, inalienable territories should be demarcated as residences for the natives. What follows in his treatise, however, has quite a different meaning.
Above all, the author demands the right to vote for the Europeans in Swaziland, which, as already mentioned, he describes as an already existing majority of Englishmen, or at least hopes to see made into one soon. In return for permission to take over Swazi land, however, the Transvaal Free State should "renounce all claims to any territory to the north of its borders and furthermore exert all its influence to promote our efforts to open up Inner Africa through the British South African Company. One would think this would be enough. But the former Governor of the Cape, who retired from office because he did not agree with the more rapidly advancing party of the Great Africans, confesses to still further intentions. They amount to nothing less than the removal of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State from the book of independent commonwealths. His concluding words may find a place here. Ce says: "If the English in Swafi=land were granted the right to vote, it could not long be withheld from those in the Transvaal. I do not believe that the consequence of this would be the immediate renewal of the Transvaal as a British settlement - that could at any rate only happen after some time - as the English there do not seem to wish to come under the immediate supervision of Downing Street. Nor would there be any immediate prospect of the incorporation of this Republic and the Orange Free State into the Cape Settlement or Natal, with the introduction of responsible government for the latter. As long as the Transvaal remains a landlocked country, we can offer it nothing that would make it give up its independence. The next result of an English majority in Transvaal, endowed with political night, would, however, be the replacement of the existing exclusive and despotic (!) Boer rule by an Anglicized and liberalized republic, which would be in full affection and friendly alliance with the third settlements in South Africa. In view of such a turn of events, I would be inclined to go even further than granting the Boers permission to take possession of Swazi land. On one condition I would allow them, with the consent of the natives, to carry out their wish to annex part of the territory between the Lebombo Mountains and the Pongolo River. Nor would I place any obstacle in their way to reach the sea through North Amatonga land, if they are able to achieve this goal, which they have so eagerly pursued for so long. The condition on which I would insist for this further concession would be that Transvaal enters into a customs union with the Third Settlements and the Orange Free State. On this condition, which would conduct the trade of the whole of South Africa through its most natural and cheapest channels, unhampered by artificial restrictions, I see more benefit than harm in obtaining a seaport for Transvaal. We would thereby be enabled, if necessary, to coerce them cheaply, if nocessary, and, by making our fleet shot against the outside unavoidable, pave the way for the eventual establishment of a Dundee domination of South Africa under the Dundee banner. In a roundabout way the Transvaal and the Dranje Free State are to be put to an end; and it is Sir Herlules Robinson who is now carrying out such plans! The rapid escalation of antagonisms can be described more clearly. Holland and the whole of Lower Germany would have to come to an understanding if the independence of those free communities is not to perish otherwise. Carl Blind. Securing the New East Frisian sphere of interest. The article in No. 4 of this year's issue, "Die Sicherung der Deutschen Jnteressensphäre in Deutsch=Ostafrika" ("Securing the German sphere of interest in German East Africa") will have found the support of all colonial friends due to its excellent tendency and the forcefulness of its explanations. However, as the editors also indicate in a note, it is probably too black-sighted, especially with regard to the validity of older rights of the Portuguese and the recognition of new treaties concluded with Portugal on East African demarcations. Since this article calls for the opening of the question of the western boundary of our East African possessions, the undersigned would like to point out that there is at least one official official statement, which has received little attention up to now, according to which the German imperial government seems to take it for granted that the German East African colony also extends to Tanganyika and Ryassa. The "Explanatory Memorandum" to the "Draft of a law concerning a postal steamship connection with East Africa" (Printed Papers of the Reichötages, V. Seision 1809/90 No. 106 p. 8) states: "The only thing that matters is that, what has been neglected for so long, the existing sources of aid are opened up and developed under the rule of orderly conditions. Efforts are being made in this direction from various sides, in which Germany also has a special share, after the agreements with England and Portugal of 1886 gave German influence a defined sphere of interest, which, as is known, extends from the Wanga= to the Rovuma River, i.e. over about 6 degrees of latitude, and in the hinterland reaches to the great lakes (Victoria Nyanza, Tanganyika, Nyassa), the hydrographic center of Africa. This is the exact wording, except that we have emphasized a few words in print. If the official view, which corresponds to the general view in Germany, has already been expressed and explained in this way in a document, it would be necessary and desirable to dispel all doubts of public opinion, the importance of which has been proven so often.

and which is not to be underestimated, both in Germany and especially abroad, by a rebolte, unambiguous declaration and thus to eliminate any possibility of polemics by English and other newspapers. Dr. Wiechmann=Ludwigslust. The "Paddy"=Care in Ceylon. A public meeting called by the "Cobden" Club was held in London these days for the purpose of discussing the great grievances arising from the "paddy" tax (i.e., the tax on unfertilized rice) in Ceylon, and the unfortunate consequences to which the levy and collection of this tax has given rise. This hitherto unopened subject is important because it raises a constitutional question concerning the relations of the Ceylon Government to the British Parliament. The meeting was addressed by a number of speakers, Members of Parliament and others, including the author. The principal oration was delivered by Mr. Salmon, recently appointed Commissioner to the West Coast of Africa, and a former administrator of various English colonies, practised by years of experience. The facts he presented to the meeting must, however, be regarded as entirely reliable. Mr. Salmon began by giving a résumé of the history of Ceylon, from the annexation of the island by England, and stated it to be indisputable that the English system of taxation had brought about a condition in Ceylon which might well be described as a chronic famine. Two years ago, he said, more than a thousand were exiled for non-payment of the paddv=tars and had to starve miserably. Anyone familiar with the conditions on the island would agree with his view that taxing food is irresponsible. The tax levied represented no less than 22 percent of the total value of the rice in the husk that reached the threshing floor, while an import duty of 29 percent was levied on imported rice. The people are not able to bear such oppressive burdens; and where they are not completely worn out, they are almost reduced to skeletons. It was high time to put an end to this misery, which was a stain on British rule. The English public was accustomed to regard Ceplon as the model of a crown colony*); they are all the more horrified to realize the abominable horrors to which the inheritance of that tax has led for so long. The prospect of a lively agitation throughout England concerning this state of affairs was held out, and it was decided to set a zealous propaganda at work immediately. This, however, opens at the same time a far wider question, namely, whether and to what extent British rule in India has been accompanied by success or failure. It cannot be denied that there, too, the imposition of the tax in question has almost never been carried out without some questionable grumbling; and the character traits of the Indians and English are separated by an impossibly wide gulf. A present-day writer, Mr. W. Digby, rightly says: "The English in India are nothing but strangers in a distant land - mere migratory birds. Selfless devotion in the higher sense (saltruism of tho best order) is entirely absent; and the rigid compulsion of legal formalities and future routine takes the place of that which alone could bridge the gulf between them - the endeavor to approach each other (adup tability) and friendly congeniality (sympathy). Charles Hancock Member of the Cobden Club. London, January 14, 1890 A correction. Although the German friends of colonialism have many reasons to be angry about the course of English colonial policy, and in the competition of nations for the still open territories of our globe the struggle cannot be avoided, it should nevertheless be ensured that this struggle is conducted honestly and not with the unworthy weapons of gross untruth. What has unfortunately been excluded in the correspondence from Brissel (p. 25), namely, that "English missionaries hand the South Sea Islanders a cup of rum to promote the work of conversion and arouse in them a craving for firewater", must be described as such by any knowledgeable person who is reasonably familiar with the often exaggerated struggle of all English missionary circles against all spirits, knows that such an assertion is a complete distortion of the facts. All English missionaries, however diverse they may otherwise be, deplore the importation of spirits as one of the most serious obstacles to their work The falsity of the example by which the correspondence explains this assertion is particularly evident. In the Solomon Islands, a Baptist missionary is said to have offered his Wesleyan colleague only two glasses of rum to the person being baptized, and to have saved the souls to be saved with four glasses. I state that neither Baptist nor Wesleyan missionaries have ever been active on the Solomon Islands, but only Anglican missionaries from the Melanesian Mission, where there can be no question of rivalry. This insinuation, which lacks all factual knowledge, is clearly characterized as a gross slander and what is said about the treatment of the Anstral negroes is based on *) A Crown Colony, as is well known, differs from a colony in which one has full representation and responsible government (responsible covernwent) or (in other words) self-government (homorule). In the Crown Colony, the Crown has sole control of all legislation, and the administration is in the hands of civil servants under the control of the British Government.
Generalization of individual occurrences which becomes grossly untruthful. Space does not permit me to enumerate all the measures taken in the Australian colonies, with great sacrifice and devotion, for the protection of the dwindling natives. But this much is certain, that nowadays they exceed at least tenfold all unworthy outrages against natives. When the author says: "The Australian Negroes, who have always enjoyed British rule", this is also an inaccuracy. Only a few thousand of them are actually under British rule, while most of the natives of the continent still enjoy independence - apart from half a million Australian Negroes on the islands. It is not honorable for us to fight our colonial political opponents with such weapons. May it henceforth be waged only with truth and well-founded expertise! D. Grundemann. We have brought this correction to you unabridged and only wish to point out that we have asked the correspondent in question to substantiate his assertions. When we printed the article, we already emphasized in a note that we were leaving the responsibility to him, as these circumstances are more remote to us, while he had only returned from Australia a few months ago. There was all the less reason to refuse to include this article altogether, as the author referred to an Australian newspaper, the Queensländer, and the reports of a former police inspector printed therein. D. Ed. Communications from the Society. The Committee held a meeting on February 18 in the Society's offices under the chairmanship of Mr. Simon, Regierungsrat, at which it was decided that a Board meeting should be held in Verlin at the end of March, and a number of business matters were dealt with - the formation of departments in Torgau, Gumbinnen, Mülheim a. Ruhr, Saargemünd. We are pleased to report the formation of new departments in Torgau, Gumbinnen, Mülheim a. Ruhr and Saargemünd. The executive committee of the Torgau department consists of the following gentlemen: Government master builder Fr. Pfannenschmidt (chairman and secretary), bank business owner Mahlow (treasurer). The board of the Gumbinnen department consists of the following gentlemen: Lieutenant Colonel Taegen (chairman). Postrat Kriesche (secretary), Kreisbaumeister Kolberg (treasurer). The executive committee of the Mülheim a. Ruhr department consists of: Gerb. Kücken (1st chairman), Jos. Thyssen (2nd chairman), E. Schnürau, grammar school teacher (secretary), Gust. Stinnes (treasurer), Alfr. Dieckmann, secondary school teacher (assessor). Joh. Rößmann, Dr. Loock, Alfr. Thiel, Karl Mellinghoff (assessors). The board of the Saargemünd department consists of the following gentlemen: First Public Prosecutor Boecking (chairman), senior teacher Dr. Grober (secretary), Rotar Albert (treasurer) Berlin department. On February 14, Dr. Kohlstock gave a lecture on the medical service in East Africa and the sanitary conditions there, which began with a description of the Sudanese journey to Bagamoyo. Already in Aden smallpox broke out among them, on the journey they also suffered from Aden fever, and finally many Europeans also fell ill, as the "Martha" had a longer rest than planned due to a break in the propeller, and all kinds of deficiencies occurred. In Bagamovo, the medical work had to focus particularly on the Somalis, who were not at all suited to the humid climate and consequently had to be sent back home soon. Soon after arriving in Bagamoyo, the attack on Buschiri's camp began. Speaker then describes the beneficial work of the sisters of the National Women's Association for Nursing in the Colonies and the Fathers of the French Mission, who have rendered great services to the Schutztruppe. The Zulus proved to be the best bearers of sickness. It was interesting to note that polyclinics have been set up on the coast where the natives are to be treated free of charge or for a small fee. What Kohlstock said about the climate of the coast is well known, as is the fact that Tanga is suitable for the establishment of a sanatorium on account of its elevated position, which allows free access to the sea winds, and its swamp-free surroundings. The intention was to establish a health station on Ras Mubesa, opposite Pangant and exposed to the sea winds, but this was abandoned because there is a shortage of drinking water. In his opinion, Dar es Salaam is not as climatically unhealthy as its reputation; it is only dangerous at the time of the north-east monsoon when the wind blows over the swamps, but not climatically dangerous at the time of the south-west monsoon. He expressed the hope that it would be possible to find places further inland where the soldiers of the protection force, weakened by the climate, could recover. - On February 21, Librarian Ballin spoke about Emin Pasha and Stanley's expedition, in which, after an interesting summary of events, he concluded by expressing the hope that Emin Pasha would find a suitable use for his great administrative abilities in the service of German interests. Erfurt Division. The department held its annual general meeting on January 29 under the chairmanship of Major General (ret.) von Gilsa. After dealing with business matters, Mr. Premierleuinant Neubourg gave an interesting lecture on: Dr. Junker in the Aequatorial Province 1877/78. The board for 1890 consists of the following gentlemen: Major General a. D. von Gilsa chairman, Director Neubauer deputy chairman and book administrator, bookseller Neumann deputy book administrator, merchant Steinbrück Kaisirer,

Mr. Richter Stadtländer was in the chair. - Dresden Department. On February 10, Dr. Haus Meyer gave a very attractive lecture on his last journey to Kilimanjaro and its ascent. Hofrat Dr. Creds thanked the speaker at the Kaiserslautern branch. From December onwards, the practical Arn, Mr. lr. Rühel from here, gave a very interesting lecture for our members on: "Sprien, a new colonization field" - In the following general meeting, the current committee was expanded as follows: Chairman: Kommerzienrat Fabrikdirektor Euler, Deputy: Fabrildirektor Dr. Brimmer, Secretary: Lebrer Rödel, Deputy: Factory owner Heller, accountant: pensioner Löwel, deputy: Bookseller Crusins, assessors: Dr. Jacob, brewery owner W. Jänisch and Professor Dr. Schultz. - Karlsruhe Branch. The third lecture evening took place there on February 13. A select audience of 500 to 600 people had gathered in the large museum hall. Naval Pastor Wangemann spoke about East African conditions in a perfectly formed manner that appealed to those present to the highest degree. His appeal for contributions to the hospital was most successful. On the same day, Wangemann was received in audience by HRH the Grand Duke. The Brussels branch of the German Colonial Society had organized a lecture by Lieutenant Giese on 12 February. It took place in the splendid hall of the German Catholic Journeymen's House, which was opened a year ago, in front of a large audience. The local German consul, Mr. W. Müser, who has rendered outstanding services not only to the preservation and cultivation of Germanness but also to the efforts of the Colonial Society and who had also initiated the conference under discussion, introduced the speaker to the gathering. Lieutenant Giese described some episodes from his experiences in the black part of the world, in particular the attack by the Kraber under Buschiri on the Mywaywa station, as well as his march to Bagamovo. These events are already well known in Germany. Here in Brussel they received the interest they deserved. The presentation was also attended by the envoy of the German Empire, von Alvensleben, from the London department. On February 14, the annual general meeting of the London Section took place at Herrmann and Bichenfeldt. After the annual report had been presented by the secretary, the previous board was re-elected by acclamation. The annual report noted the pleasing development of the section, which now has 81 members, and emphasized in particular the lively attendance at the meetings held during the winter. After the end of the general meeting, Mr. Hermann Meyer took the floor to give an interesting presentation on the Matabele= and Maschonaland and discussed the ownership structure in detail on the basis of the Throprede, the Blue Books and the Berlin Treaty. In particular, he pointed out the peculiar interpretation that the English had given to the term "sottlomont" in this case, referring to the dwellings of private traders as "British settlements", and he also pointed out the peculiar consequences of accepting the English argument that the land had been discovered by Englishmen, recalling the areas discovered by Nachtigal, Barth and Schweinfurth. Redner described the English desire to enclose the Boers on all sides and thus deprive the Low German race of the possibility of further development as the intended ultimate purpose of the English claim. Furthermore, the speaker criticized Lord Salisbury's popular interpretation of the provision of the Treaty of Verlin, according to which the powers between which differences of opinion have arisen "before taking up arms" should call upon the mediation of the other treaty powers, and doubted that the attack by Serpa Pinto had been an armed action by Portugal within the meaning of the Treaty of Verlin. Redner also pointed out that England had always diplomatically disputed Portugal's claims to the territories in question, and that the fierce attacks by continental newspapers over the ultimatum were therefore not entirely justified. With the hope that the dispute might be settled peacefully, the speaker concluded his remarks, which were received with lively applause and were followed by a lengthy discussion. Small announcements. (Sausibar.) The Sultan of Sanstbar, Seyid Khalifa, died suddenly of sunstroke on February 13, and his brother Sevid All has ascended the throne of Zanzibar. Sevid Khalisa was unlike his powerful brother Said Bargash, a man without great energy, who was not very capable of taking decisive action, but was cruel as only an Oriental despot can be, dishonest in his dealings with both Europeans and Arabs, and little respected by his fellow tribesmen. Initially, he was not very friendly towards the Germans, but later changed his behavior to such an extent that it became possible to have reasonable official dealings with him. His brother Ali was a constant threat to him, as he was suspected of wanting to depose him and had a strong backing among the dissatisfied Arad elements. Fears have repeatedly been expressed that the accession of Seyid Ali will worsen relations with the Germans, but we still see no cause for concern, as the Sultan of Sanstbar will only ever have free movement to the extent that it is in the interests of the cultural aspirations of the two powers, given the generally good relations between England and Germany. The new Sultan has already received the recognition of the Powers, which, as we assume, has been granted by Germany only on condition that the new Sultan maintains the obligations assumed by his predecessor and has given sufficient guarantees for his adherence to the treaty. Incidentally, the new Sultan of Zanzibar informed Emperor Wildelm II of his accession to the throne, expressing his devotion. The Sultan also informed Prince Bismarck of his accession to the throne, with the "request for support for himself and his people. (From the Wißmann expedition.) Banaheri's attempt to stir up the Maasais against the Germans failed because Lieutenant Gravenreuth captured the 200 loads of gifts sent for this purpose; Lieutenant Gravenreuth also captured Bushiri's brother, who was hanged. - Wißmann's expedition to Usambara was accompanied by great success. Zimbodia and all the native chiefs submitted voluntarily and returned all the objects that had recently been stolen from Dr. Meyer and other travellers. - Major Liebert also took with him to East Africa the equipment for the reinforcement of the Schutztruppe, which is to be recruited for the reconquest of the south. The equipment is supposedly calculated for a new force of 1,400 blacks. This consists, among other things, of 18 mountain lanons, which are equipped for transportation by mule, as well as the associated saddlery, a Maxim cannon, two small torpedo boats, four boats intended for river navigation and 1,500 repeating rifles together with plenty of ammunition. As a fortified station is to be built on one of the inner caravan routes, two heavy, towed guns have also been loaded for this purpose. Dismountable wooden dwellings made in Altona for the German officers and sub-officers are also ready for embarkation. The "Sanstbar" has also taken 11 engineers and machinists, as well as two nurses, to East Africa. Trade factor "Magdeburg"). The German Colonial Society, Magdeburg section, has appointed two members, August Schiele and Georg Marcrander, to establish a trading factor "Maadeburg" in Africa. Schiele had previously managed a Woermann factoring company in Cameroon for several years and was therefore no longer a newcomer; Marerander was a farmer. On February 11, the two gentlemen left for Tanga via Hamburg. (The Deutsch=ostafrikanische Plantagengesellschaft) has sent Mr. Georg Müller, who was a tobacco planter on Sumatra for five years, and Mr. Georg Passarge from East Prussia to Zanzibar with the tamper "Amazone" of the Messageries maritimes, which left Marseille on February 12, in order to resume the tobacco cultivation in Lewa, which was unfortunately interrupted by the uprising. - (Catholic Mission in the Swahili Sultanate.) In the hinterland of Witu in the Wapokomo area, there has been a branch of the Neukirchen Protestant Mission in Naao am Tana for several years. The station there was destroyed about 1 year ago during a Somali invasion. The construction of a new mission house is underway and it is hoped that it will be completed this spring. In the last letters from the missionaries there to Neukirchen it is reported that the Suabeli Sultanate now also has Catholic missionaries with the intention of starting their work in the countryside of Subaki on the Tana. (A defence for Emin Pasha.) Some statements by the reporter of the "Times" in Cairo, and subsequently by the paper itself, about Emin Pasha's relations with Gordon have caused the former's friend, Dr. Felkin, to raise his informed voice against the continued denigration of our compatriot. The Times reporter had said that without Gordon's leadership, Emir would not have been able to administer his province and control its officers and officials. And the Times, in its review of the news, compared him to a sub-schoolmaster who did an excellent job as long as he could send someone to beat the high-spirited boys over the head. Dr. Felkin now counters all these suspicions. As he proves, when officers began to behave riotously in Kharkum, they were sent to the Aquatorial Province to be brought to their senses. It was precisely this procedure that made Emin's position so difficult. In fact, he only sent back those who were condemned to death, as he did not have the right to decide over life and death. There were only a few of them and some of them had a higher rank than Emin, who was only appointed Bei in 1879. To appreciate Emin's importance as an administrator, one must consider that before his arrival the province had an annual deficit of 600,000 marks, and after three years of his service it was already 24,000 marks in surplus. The slave hunters were chased away by Emin, who also defeated the Mahdists, which seems to have been almost forgotten, three years before their last attack, so that they had to take so long to recover. For ten years Emin had to rely entirely on himself and only on the never-safe troops. From 1878 until Gordon's resignation, only one steamer came up the river to the province, and it was the one on which Felkin traveled. At the end of his letter to The Times, Felkin says that he considers it highly inappropriate to attack in this way a man who has achieved such great things and is now prevented from replying by his illness. The exiled King Mwanga) of Uganda, with the help of the Christians, defeated his opponent King Kareina and the Arabs allied with him.

Page 63

and it seems as if better conditions will now return to Uganda. This would be of great importance, as the warlike population of Uganda could provide a protective wall against the penetration of Marxism, if Mwanga, which is doubtful given his fickle character, shows his gratitude for the help given to him by the Christians and written missionaries. It would be very much to be hoped that the Germans would also do something to strengthen the position of the Christians in Uganda. (The Delagoabai=Ironbabn affair) has not yet come any further, especially as on February 20, Under-Secretary of State Fergusson declared in the House of Commons that the Crown Lawyers were of the opinion that the King of Portugal did not have the right to revoke the concession for the Lourenzo=Marquez Railway. A new attempt will therefore be made by England to bring the railroad into English hands. The extent to which the construction of the Delagoabai Railway is feared in Cape Town can be seen from the following passage from a letter we received from Pretoria: "Since the middle of 1889, the Cape newspapers have been publishing one lamentation after another about the Delagoabai Railway, the completion of which would lead to the complete ruin of the Cape Rooster, but would have even greater consequences for the Cape and Natal Colony. The railroads would carry little giiter medr, the warehouses would stand empty, the sornarding agouto would fall into ruin and the wholesale trade would suffer a significant loss. The English transit duty would disappear and the jmpori in the English colonies would be greatly reduced; in short, the completion of the railroad would have such far-reaching consequences that the English colonial government, in order to avert complete ruin, would have to make concessions to Transvaal that would greatly dampen English self-conceit. (Warning.) The German trading and colonization company (Zehlicke and v. Egloff), against whose prospectuses we already warned most emphatically in Nos. 6 and 8 of the previous volume of the Deutsche Kolonialzeitung, had at the time abandoned the plan criticized by us to set up an agricultural enterprise in South West Africa, but had sent an expedition to Pondoland and occupied a farm there called "Wilhelmsburg". Due to all kinds of disputes among the members of the expedition and a lack of support from the management in Berlin, this facility was given up and abandoned. The latest prospectus from December 1889, which is written in the most flourishing style, following the example of the earlier ones, predicts a good harvest of tobacco and corn on this farm as early as March 1890! The following table shows how fantastic the company's calculations are, despite the complete lack of a secure business basis: "With a working capital of 500,000 marks for the trading department, a six-fold conversion of the capital is possible per year, i.e. a total turnover of 3 million marks. Since a minimum profit of 10 percent is to be added to this, the net profit from the turnover of goods would amount to around 300,000 marks per year, which means that a dividend of 20 to 25 percent would be expected from a total capital of 1 million marks for the capital investment of the silent partners (!)" We hereby wish once again to warn most emphatically against participating in this venture. - (The Belgian anti-slavery company) has decided, with the permission of the Congo state, to set up a fortified camp on the Lomami in order to stop the advance of the Arabs. Dr. Preuß will soon be assigned to the German expedition in Batanga,) southern Cameroon, as a botanist. Dr. Preuß has already been to the Varombi station on Lake Elephant on his own initiative and with his own funds, where he was allowed to stay. The expedition is now headed by the first lieutenant Morgen, who had to take over the management of the Jeundestation immediately after his arrival there, without first becoming acquainted with the country and its people; He is assisted only by a European, the former Berlin Schutzmann Hörbolt, who, after the death of Tappenbeck, was in charge of the whole expedition - (Major Mac Donald's report) on the conditions in the Niger region has been received, but, as Under-Secretary of State Fergusson informed the House of Commons, will not be published, as it is of a confidential nature The report must cast a bad light on the administration of the Roval Niger Company, that the English Government does not follow the example set by the German one. (Herr Haus Arnold), the new director of the New Gulnea Company, who had only left Berlin on June 2 of last year, died suddenly there a few months after his arrival in Finschhafen, and for the time being Herr Geh. Regierungsrat Rose, the Imperial Commissioner there, has been entrusted with taking over his functions. This death is a serious reminder to the companies to take into account, when selecting the officials to be sent to the colonies, whether they are able to cope with the dangers of the tropical climate. (From Kaiser=Wilhelmsland.) The experiments with the cultivation of tobacco. Cotton rc. have, according to the "Hamburger Korrespondent", yielded such satisfactory results that plantation cultivation is now to be tackled on a larger scale. The sample of cotton received here some time ago was extremely popular on the market, fetched more than the average price and prompted one manufacturer to say that he would be happy to take on a whole crop of this cotton. The New Guinea Company is expecting a large quantity of cotton in March
(approx. 500 quintals) of cotton in March and, if the quality is similar to that of the first shipment, intends to establish cotton plantations on a larger scale. When one realizes that the export of cotton from the United States to Europe in 1888 amounted to 4,000,000 bales worth about 850 million marks, it seems worthwhile to try to ensure the proper production of cotton in our colonies as well. The tadak built in New Guinea according to the Dutch model achieved no less favorable prices, bringing 1.50 to 2.50 marks per pound. (From Samoa.) On December 4, Malietoa was elected king and his flag was raised. On December 5 there was a ceremonial reception of the consular corps. The German Consul General Dr. Stübel read out the following welcoming address: "May it please Your Royal Highness: On this, our first official visit to Your Highness since Your reinstatement, it falls to me to. to congratulate Your Highness on your restoration to a post that you have previously held so well (1). I do so with the greatest sincerity and I hope that your government will be a long and happy one and, with God's help, an era of peace and prosperity for all of Samoa. Similar speeches were read by the English Consul Colonel von Costlogon and the American Vice-Consul Blacklock, after which Dr. Stübel took the floor again and read out a proclamation stating "that the Governments of Germany, Great Britain and the United States of America recognize Malictoa Laupepa as King of Samoa from this date forward. We also earnestly desire that the two parties, who have hitherto been hostile to each other, may bring about a final reconciliation as soon as possible, and that both may contribute to the best of their ability to the peaceful administration of the Samoan Government under King Malietoa". - (The consul Dr. Knappe,) who held the consulate for Samoa during the previous year's fighting and unrest on Opolu, has been made available and is no longer listed in the new consular directory. (From Gabon.) The French government has come into dispute with the King of Dahomey, who today questioned the cession of the port of Kotonn on the Slave Coast, which took place some time ago. The deed of cession is with the French Residency in Porto-Novo (Porto-Novo is a small state under French protectorate on the Slave Coast between Dahomey and the English colony of Lagos with the capital of the same name. - Kotonu lies directly on the border of Porto=Novo in Dahomey by the sea). At the beginning of 1889, King Gléglé of Dahomey wrote to King Tofa of Porto-Novo. "that he would attack him at the end of the year to seize his person and that he would destroy the city and all the palm trees." The government was aware of this, because in August it sent Bayol, the gonvernor-general of the Golles of Benin, to communicate with Glögle about the demarcation of the Kotonon area and to ask him to place himself under French protection. However, the mission was unsuccessful. Glöglé died, and recently his son carried out the threat by seizing Porto=Novo, burning the houses, destroying the crops and decimating the Senegalese tirailleurs. In view of these facts, the French government ordered the embarkation of two companies of Senegalese tirailleurs in Dakkar on the "Ariege" to reinforce the garrison of Porto=Novo and Kotonn. The King of Dahomey has now also attacked Kotonu with 500 men, but was repulsed with great loss. Litterature. J. Jastrow.

After an introduction, which emphasizes the importance of African historical research for the solution of more general historical problems and particularly highlights the merits of the English and French in the study of African history, the most important phenomena during the period mentioned are listed and in part acknowledged, including a particularly meritorious compilation of the blue books concerning Africa, which indeed offer in-depth material, albeit often presented from a tendentious point of view. The author can be fully endorsed when he calls for more extensive use of the reports and journals of the various missionary societies working in Africa, which contain many valuable contributions to the history of individual African regions, drawn from the best sources.

The "Little Tales from Cameroon" are dedicated to children, but adults will also read them with interest. After all, it is precisely in such products of a people's imagination that its mood and spiritual life is most clearly reflected. And how little we actually know our black compatriots in this respect, we realize almost at every turn when reading these very cutely told fairy tales. Indeed, it is not uncommon to catch oneself doubting whether this or that trait of the mind, this or that spiritual impulse could in fact be possible in representatives of a race which, despite all our humanitarian efforts, we have a certain involuntary tendency to recognize as equal due to traditional prejudices deeply ingrained by a peculiar combination of circumstances. Indeed, when the first edition of the Tales from Cameroon was published, it met with all kinds of criticism; its authenticity was questioned here and there and it was declared to be a free invention of the author, although a comparison with Steere's Swadili Tales and the various other productions of the Ovaherero, the Bassuto and other tribes spoke decisively in favor of the authenticity of the "Tales from Cameroon", which thus represent a remarkable contribution to the assessment of the question of the favorable aptitude of the Negro. However, it is to be regretted that such valuable material has only been made available to the public in an adaptation for children. It would be urgently desirable that it should also be published in the Urterte with a translation as close as possible to the original. A. Seidel. Les Colonies Françaises.

The present book, produced as a result of the Paris Colonial Exhibition of 1889, has the express purpose of popularizing knowledge of the French colonies, and is very richly illustrated for this purpose. The descriptions of the individual colonies are excellent in their way; if here and there the light pages are too much in the foreground, this is due to the tendency of the work, which, however, after the present first volume, which is to be followed by four others, allows a comprehensive overview of the French colonial empire to be gained. The book is also so inexpensive that it can be recommended with a clear conscience. Our colonies and Christianity.

Paris C. Reinwald 1889. VIII. 724 p. Dupont's trip to the Congo was primarily for scientific purposes. The description of his travel experiences as well as the presentation of the results of his research contains a great deal that is stimulating and interesting, and no less scientifically valuable. From the latter point of view, the exploration of the geological conditions of the Congo's primeval landscapes from its mouth to the mouth of the Kassal deserves particular attention. The first of the eleven maps and illustrations included in the book shows that the banks of the river from Banana almost as far as Boma consist of tertiary formations. Shortly before Boma, granite appears in massive form, which continues to Maassuk, interrupted by gneiss, mica schist and quartzite, which gain the upper hand at Maassuk and dominate almost all the way to Jjanghila. Quartzite, limestone and slate alternate as far as Lukungn and are then replaced by red sandstone, which accompanies the river as far as Kinstla and, further away from the banks, as far as Stanley=Pool. Of no less interest is a study of the distribution of the various palm species along the Congo. According to this, the wild date (Phoenix spinosa) grows exclusively at the mouth of the river; the Matedbe (Hyphaene guineensis) only in the vicinity of Boma, the fan palm (Borasous flabelliformis) on the southern bank from Leopoldville to the mouth of the Kassai, while the Oipalm (Elais guineenss) accompanies the river everywhere on both banks, as far as Dupont's research goes. It may suffice to emphasize this from the rich content of the book, which is undoubtedly one of the most important that the multiple Congo researches of the last decade have produced. I. Seidel. The circumnavigation of Africa by Phoenician sailors around 600 B.C. Ged. von Willi Müller, Dr. phil., senior teacher, Rathenow, Max Babenzien. In this book the question "Was Africa circumnavigated before the circumnavigation of Basco de Gama" is raised anew and answered by the author in the affirmative. The book offers an interesting and varied content and is highly recommended to Africa lovers of our time. Customs=Compass.

Entrances for the library. Given the limited space we have for book reviews, it will not be possible to discuss all works in detail, but we never fail to recommend new colonial writings, which are assigned to our library by the authors and publishers, to colonial friends in word and deed, for which the administration of the library is given ample opportunity by our members.

Supplement to No. 5 of the1 Deutsche Kolonialzeitung 1890. From the German Emin Pasha Expedition.
When the Kolonialzeitung was already in print, we received a report from its employee, Mr. C. Weiß from Lamu, through the kindness of the Deutsche Witu=Gesellschaft, which contains so much new information that we consider it necessary to bring it to the attention of our readers in a special supplement: Lamu, January 25, 1890 "Recently, the press at home has often dealt with Peters' expedition; once Peters was dead, then he lived on quietly. The fact is that at the end of October rumors were circulated here on the coast that Peters and his entourage had been killed in Korokoro, but these were not confirmed by anything. It was a vain combination of the natives, and it was highly imprudent of some of those living here to take this gossip seriously and spread it far and wide. These days the brave Borchert, who marched from Lamu to Kenya at the beginning of November, has returned here; he had had to struggle with the greatest difficulties on the journey. He had suffered red and privations of all kinds, but had striven with a tenacity and perseverance to carry out the task assigned to him that must deserve all recognition. Borchert reached Korokoro, was in the boma built by Peters, and although despite all his efforts he did not succeed in bringing back any written messages from Peters, which he will have left behind on his onward journey, credible reports from Gallas, who were with Borchert in Korokoro, have reached here that Peters was able to deal with the agitated Gallas and was led by them to the Maasai border, where he was also not received with hostility and was granted free passage and permission to buy food. The latest news reaches up to this point, and although it must be considered a very daring undertaking to move from Korokoro into the infamous Maasai country with about 20 Somali soldiers and a number of Gallas slaves, it must not be immediately assumed that Peters and his entourage must perish there. On the contrary, because he is too weak to be able to accomplish anything by force, the people will realize that he has not come to make war; and if he knows how to send himself into the often unpredictable moods of the people, it is to be assumed that he will get out of the thus feared district with his skin intact to more peaceable tribes and thus in the course of time reach the coast again somewhere." (Here follow some remarks which we have omitted, as they coincide with those of Mr. Borchert. "In Kinakombe, Borchert was forced to stay for several days as he was unable to obtain oarsmen. Fortunately for Borchert, an English expedition from the south, 90 men strong, led by a Swahili, Baruk, arrived here, which was to go to Oda=Boru=Ruwa and beyond to do ivory business; Borchert joined this caravan as far as Massa, where he wanted to stay and await Schlunke with the following goods; But he too was delayed longer than he had anticipated, and when he was finally close to Massa, he had the misfortune that the dhow turned over and all the goods were lost; only his bare life was saved. Schlunke went back to Kinakombe, where in the meantime a second dhow with very necessary supplies had turned over and everything was lost. Borchert, who was striving forward, could no longer wait for Schlunke and decided to march on alone; he should not have separated from the English caravan at Massa and would then have reached Korokoro with it without any further difficulties. A short distance behind Massa, Borchert lost his way in the large open plain; he had believed that the Tana had a more north-westerly direction, whereas here it runs almost north, and had therefore strayed too far from the river on his march. Borchert wandered around in this plain for 4 days without food or water, marching day and night, and when he reached the river again late on the fourth day, he soon came across a village, but could get nothing but corn at the time, and thus thoroughly spoiled his stomach. But unconcerned about everything, Borchert continued his journey after a short rest, and on Christmas Eve he reached the station established by Peters in Oda=Boru=Ruwa, from where Peters last gave news on October 8. Petere was no longer there. The boma and houses were all intact, as he had left them, the German banners fluttered merrily in the wind, and the Krupp cannon stood untouched in its old place. (A piece of the castle had already been lost on the journey. After Borchert's arrival became known, numerous armed Gallas gathered, threatening Borchert and forbidding him to sell food. Since Borchert did not speak Galla, he could not communicate well with the people, nor could he receive any definite information as to whether and where Peters had left any letters; it is quite inconceivable that Peters would have traveled on without leaving detailed news for his comrades who were to follow; on the other hand, the Gallas would certainly have delivered any letters in their hands, for the paper has absolutely no value to the people. After all this, it is not unlikely that any letters from Peters have been taken by the English caravans from Malindi=Mombassa, which pass by regularly to do ivory business, and the English will then be better informed about Peters' aims and intentions than we are. After a three-day stay, Borchert was forced to leave the station as quickly as possible, as otherwise he would have been murdered; it was not possible for him to advance any further with his six men and he could not receive any further news from Peters; in addition, the consequences of the hardships suffered and the great exertions were now making themselves felt, a little fever was added to the general weakness and so we headed for the coast as quickly as possible, reaching Schlunke in Kinakombe, who will stay behind there. to hunt elephants. After a short rest, he continued downriver to Ngao, where he found a friendly welcome and good care from the German missionaries. After recovering there to a certain extent, he arrived here shortly before the mail left and intends to go to Zanzibar first, in order to ship most of the expedition items brought back and still stored in Zanzibar in the best possible way, before starting his return journey to Europe. We have tried. Borchert to write longer reports about his experiences for this mail; he would only be unnecessarily stressed by this, when rest is so good for him. This was one of the main reasons for me to write the above for the public. The relatives, many friends and patrons of the participants in this expedition, I believed, would only be pleased to receive reliable news from here quite soon and in detail, and since the news from the Gallas was essentially confirmed to me by Borchert, I have no hesitation in spreading it further about the conflict that Peters had with the Gallas above, and which perhaps gave rise to the false rumors about the murder of the Gallas.

Extra 2

I have been told the following. After Peters had been in his station for some time, a number of runaway slaves of the Gallas reported to him, who were immediately engaged as porters and provided with rifles and cartridges. One day, these newly hired porters got into an altercation with the Gallas, made use of their firearms and killed several Gallas. This caused great indignation among the Gallas. Thousands flocked together and wanted to wage war against Peters. He managed to convince the people that he knew nothing about the whole shooting affair, that it was their own people who had caused the riot. The Gallas then demanded their slaves back to have their heads cut off; but here too Peters stood firm and explained to the Gallas that "when these people came to me and offered their services, I did not know that they were runaway slaves of yours, otherwise I would not have accepted them; but now that I have engaged them and taken them into my service, it is not possible for me to dismiss them again, they must stay with me". To calm the Gallas somewhat, however, he promised to hand over all the porters when he returned so that they could cut off their heads. This seems to have calmed the Gallas down again, as they gave Peters permission to sell food again and also took it upon themselves to escort Peters beyond the border of their territory. It is not clear why Peters did not wait for his companions to follow, as agreed; perhaps he did not trust the Gallao and took advantage of their good mood to leave before the hostile current against him reasserted itself at the beginning of December; the Gallas led him to the border and handed him over to the Masai there. On arrival, a great palaver was immediately held and Peters was asked about the destination and purpose of his journey: "I have traveled through many and great countries and have come to euc to see and get to know your country. I am * about talked a man of peace and want no war, Peters. "If you want war, we are always ready for it. But if you want peace, we will grant it to you, the Maasai replied. After Peters had again assured them that he did not want war, but peace, he was assured of peace and allowed to pass through the country; he would also receive food everywhere if he could pay for it. After all this had been arranged, the Masai slaughtered 2 head of cattle and gave a large meal; when this was finished, the Gallas accompanying Peters withdrew, and this is the last news we receive from Peters; it will probably be some time before any other news reaches the public again. So the committee's order to return has not yet reached the hands of Dr. Peters. According to the information provided by the Galla, Peters still had with him: 20 men who had remained loyal to him from the beginning, a few camels and donkeys. The number of slaves the Gallas had taken with them could not be ascertained. C. White.

A word from the Emperor. At the lunch given in honor of His Majesty the Emperor on March 5 by the Provincial Diet of the Province of Brandenburg, the Emperor gave a speech that was received with enthusiastic applause and was significant in every respect, in which he spoke the following words from the soul of every colonial friend, referring to the activities of the Great Elector: "In my room hangs a picture that had long been forgotten; it shows a row of proud ships, the red eagle of Brandenburg in the flag. This picture reminds me daily of how the Great Elector already had the correct insight that Brandenburg had to conquer a position in the world market in order to utilize its diligence and its manpower. The progress that Prussia and Germany's trade and commerce have made since that time has been great, especially under My Lord Grandfather's government. I consider promoting the further flourishing of our economic activity to be one of my most noble tasks; I have therefore turned my attention inwards, after my activities were initially aimed at securing peace on the outside."
What the great ancestor expressed as a principle and tirelessly pursued until the end of his life: "Seafaring and trade are the noblest pillars of an estate, through which the subjects obtain their food and sustenance both by sea and by the Manufaktum on land, continues to have a driving force in the grandson and fills us with the joyful confidence that the great work of German colonization that has begun will be eagerly promoted by the highest authority. Two hundred years ago, self-satisfied complacency, philistine pusillanimity, the spirit of particularism, the Privy Councils, states envious of the rise of Kurbrandenburg opposed the undertakings of the Great Elector as "a few obstacula"; today the tide has turned for the better, but nevertheless large masses of the German people are still indifferent, if not hostile, to colonial policy, and the opposition of foreign countries persecutes us in almost all of our colonies. Under the protection and umbrella of our Emperor, however, in the splendour of the new German Empire, we are certain to triumph and also to fulfil the world-historical mission in the field of colonization in overseas countries which Providence intended for us at the end of the nineteenth century.

The Kraber question and Emin Pasha. When the German cultural beginnings in East Africa were destroyed by the Arab uprising, it became necessary to return the colony to its original purpose by force of arms. Only gradually, therefore, will the colonial politicians be able to return to a peaceful course and deal with matters concerning both the future constitutional status of the protectorates and the attitude of the government and society towards the Arabs. We would like to draw the attention of our readers to the importance of the latter matter in particular. One mistake of the more recent German cultural endeavors was probably that too little attention was paid to the Arab element, that one thought one could easily deal with it, although it had gained a powerful influence on the education of the natives on both the good and the bad side through centuries of presence on the coast. Even though the pure Arabs were few in number compared to the masses of Swahili and natives, they led the country, especially in the coastal areas, as rulers who could see with satisfaction and pride how their law, their customs and their religion spread more and more. In his opinion, the acquisition of the hinterland by the Germans did little to change the situation in and of itself for the time being; the stations were too incinerated, even if they were correctly laid out from a commercial and political point of view. It cannot be assumed, however, that he saw them as the expression of a systematic approach, especially as their scattered location meant that they were of little consideration in the grand scheme of things. The Arab element only became generally restless when the agreements of the Sultan of Zanzibar's treaty with the East African Company became known and a part of the Arabs felt threatened in good faith in everything that had been sacred and dear to them. A louder period of administration by the Germans would have shown him that he had nothing to fear, but all sorts of adverse circumstances came together to hasten the outbreak of revolt, which grew more and more violent every day, and had to be subdued by force of arms. As there was little sign of religious fanaticism, the cause of the revolt must be sought in the feeling of the Arabs that their political and commercial power would come to an end if the Germans established themselves on the coast. As far as the exercise of political power is concerned, it is self-evident that after the events of the last few years the Arabs have lost all prospect of it, and as far as their trade relations are concerned, the whole of them, and not just a tiny number who have grasped the new era, would certainly do well to join the well-funded Germans and emancipate themselves from the Indians. In this respect, a gradual change will undoubtedly take place the stronger our military and commercial power becomes. However, there is no doubt that we must gradually accustom the Arab and Arabized coastal population to the fact that, even if some prerogatives are taken away from them, they can continue to live quietly under German rule according to their old laws and traditional customs, provided they are not absolutely hostile to European views, such as in the question of the slave trade. This peaceful side of our activities in East Africa is just as difficult as the warlike side, and it requires a great deal of tact and familiarity with Islamic law and its legal concepts if mistakes are to be avoided here. Other nations that rule over Muhammadans have also taken great pains to penetrate the legal relationships of their subjects. The English in the East Indies, the French in Algiers and Senegal, the Dutch in the Dutch Indies have made significant preparations, and recently Austria-Hungary has also had to merge Turkish and Western law in Bosnia and Herzegovina for the purposes of administration and work together in such a way that both Christians and Mohammedans can live happily under Austrian rule. The situation in the coastal area of the Sultan of Zanzibar, as created by the treaty of 1888, left the appointment of subordinate judges to the German East African Society, subject to the Sultan's approval, whereas the "Kadi" was to be appointed by the Sultan. The Kadi is therefore the most important judicial personality. The Islamic judicial system is in itself very simple; in the Ottoman Empire, the kadis decide all civil and criminal cases as single judges without exception and without the possibility of appeal. The laws contain very detailed regulations on the personal and formal qualifications of the cadi, who must also make decisions in matters of faith and ritual, so that the cadi must indeed be regarded as a scientifically educated judge." It goes without saying that he only knows and acts according to Islamic law, and it is equally clear that he has the power to cause us all kinds of inconvenience. And yet Islamic law is very sophisticated and differs from European law in many respects! Although there is no objection to the transfer of jurisdiction over the natives to their own authorities, wherever this is the case, and this relationship is natural and recommendable, it will nevertheless become necessary over time for the state to at least penetrate into the essence of this jurisdiction, if it should not prefer to introduce certain new concepts into the system of rights in highly developed conditions such as those in East Africa. It is obvious that this has its enormous difficulties, because only those who know the Qur'an and the currents in the Muslim world are able to find the middle way here, especially since Islamic law is not ossified, but is constantly evolving. It will be objected that the form of jurisdiction is fixed by contract and that unilateral changes cannot be made. Nor do we believe that existing legal systems should be overturned with a clumsy hand, but we consider it appropriate, in order to avoid later abuses and costly attempts, to exert a great influence on the administration of justice if we do not wish to remain strangers in the land. Recently, as is natural, much attention has been paid to Emin Pasha, whose health, according to all reports, has made gratifying progress, and all kinds of activities in the German interest have been sought for him. Some would like to see him used as the leader of an expedition to Wadelai, others to Uganda or to Tabora and Tanganyika for the ever more urgent securing of the German sphere of interest*), but all are united in the wish that it should be possible to win over this invaluable force for German colonial policy. Nothing has yet been said about the intentions of the government, which is supposedly negotiating with him, and we do not know whether they want to use him, the victor over the Mahdists, for warlike purposes, or whether they want to utilize his incomparable administrative skills and his deep knowledge of the Iolamite world for peaceful purposes. He should be most welcome to us in any activity! But if we have now touched on another aspect of our future task in East Africa, it is in the conviction that there is still important cultural work awaiting us here. Emin's middle position as a Turk and European in the Aquatorial Province has contributed in the best possible way to balancing existing differences, his sense of research has driven him to penetrate the individuality of the various tribes, to learn their different languages and dialects, his knowledge of the Arabic language and his position have enabled him to familiarize himself with the Iolam way of thinking. "In his administration," writes Robert William Felkin*), "Emin spared no effort to familiarize himself intimately with all matters that arose. The diligence and zeal with which he discharged all his duties were unequaled, and it was the highest aim of his endeavor to act as a perfectly impartial judge. In criminal cases, he carefully avoided limiting the defendant's defense, but it was not easy to deceive him with excuses and lies. As good-natured as he was, he never wavered in his execution once he had made a firm decision . .. The work he created and the successes he had must be recognized by all unprejudiced observers. *) We refer those who are interested in the subject to the work of Professor Dr. Kohler "Rechtsvergleichende Studien über islamitisches Recht, das Recht der Berber, das chinesische Recht und das Recht auf Ceylon" (Garl Heymanns Verlag. Berlin), in which a wealth of material is brought together and legally processed. *) The daily newspapers disagree as to which of them first pointed out the necessity of securing the German sphere of interest in East Africa. Let us note that L'Afriquo, in its No. 2 of February 1890, in a long essay on lo conflit Anglo-Portugais, after describing the first appearance of the project of the British-Fohafrican Company, writes: . . . . "Whatever the case may have been, the Deutsche Kolonialzeitung did not hesitate to draw the attention of the German Foreign Office to the project mentioned by the Times ... See the article "Englische Bestrebungen in Zentralafrika" in No. 23 of June 8, 1889 and "Die dritisch-ostafrikanischGesellschaft" in No. 22 of June 2, 1888. Since then, we have repeatedly and convincingly demonstrated the importance of proceeding towards the lakes. *) German Revne. Published by Richard Fleischer. March 1390. Breslau and Berlin.

Of what importance would this personality, in the service of the Imperial Government, be for the development of our East African territory? The Bedentung of Tabora for German East Africa. By Paul Reichard. Tabora, the main trading and staging post of the Arabs in East Africa, which lies between the 3° s. B. and 33° E. L., is by no means a town as we understand it and gives the newcomer the impression of great disappointment at first sight, an impression which is only lessened by the long march from the coast, as only small towns, villages and spots with a maximum of 2 - 300 inhabitants are passed on the entire journey. It would be a completely futile attempt to even approximately determine the number of inhabitants in Tabora, as the population is constantly flowing in and out. Tabora consists of a not too large complex of Arab farmsteads, which are scattered around irregularly. Only a small number of them are inhabited all year round. Just over 20 Arabs with slaves have a permanent residence there. Tabora lies in a very flat, very wide hollow, surrounded by low hills 50-80 meters high, which largely penetrate the area of Unjanjembe. Tabora itself is not fortified, which is not possible given the way it is built, with farmsteads mostly scattered around. From a distance, only one of the gray Arab houses with flat roofs can be seen here and there, shining out of the green euphorbia hedges. The individual farmsteads, Tembe of the Arabs, are also built with little defensive capability, so that from a strategic point of view Tabora is of no significance at all and must be described as an open space. The immediate surroundings of Tabora are extremely populated for a radius of 3-4 hours and one encounters a Wanjamuesi or Maturi settlement at least every quarter to half an hour's walk, as well as Arab farmsteads further out, none of which are fortified either. All larger complexes of farmsteads or larger villages have special names. The Quikurn, the residence of the chief Sike of Unjanjembe, however, is fortified with a so-called Ipuri, a building of man-high and 3-4 meters wide, built of mud, logs and flat moss-covered roof and enclosing the place. A maximum of 4-500 people live in this quikuru, which is situated in a very flat area, and this is also where the Arab gonvernor used to live. Since the death of the last one, Abdalla bin Nasib, who died in 1882, the Sultan of Zanzibar has no longer appointed one. The Arab settlement in Unjanjembe was founded some 70 to 80 years ago and was formerly known as Kaseh or Jkaseh, a place which has now disappeared from the face of the earth without a trace. The Arabs' choice of location for the settlement depended more on the abundance of water found in the hollows, as the often slightly marshy soil was conducive to rice and barley cultivation. There were hardly any other reasons and the then living chief Fundikira would have been just as happy to give permission to settle in other places in the area. However, the fact that the Arabs settled in the land of Unjanjembe, where Tabora is located, was no coincidence. The way there had long been paved for them by the Wanjamuesi, the people who, among other vast territories, also inhabited Unjanjembe and had been moving to the coast every year for a long time, at least 100 years, to sell ivory and slaves to the Arabs. However, the situation later changed completely when the Arabs began to penetrate into the interior and took over the trade. They followed the Wanjamnesi road from Saadani and Dar=esSalaam, and only later did Bagamoyo become the caravan exit point on the coast, via Mpuapua through Ugogo and the Mgunda Mkali to Unjanjembe. The large Arab caravans even passed through Ugunda to the south. However, as this country was still sparsely populated at that time, the road soon turned directly to the place where today's Tabora is located. At that time there were still many elephants in Unjamuesi and the Wanjanjembe, the inhabitants of Unjanjembe, were particularly keen and skillful elephant hunters. They were also keen farmers, and this last circumstance made it possible for the Arabs to settle in Unjanjembe. Since the Wanjamnesi were passionate about the carrier trade and were just as happy to migrate to the coast as to all directions in the interior, the Arabs had all the most favorable conditions imaginable for their ventures and for the settlement to flourish: a fertile region, populated by a tribe eager to cultivate the land, which also provided unsurpassed carrier material. In addition to all these favorable circumstances, the Wanjamuesi states had a fairly solid structure, for the Wanjamuesi are also quite capable warriors. When the coastal areas were no longer able to supply enough slaves after the introduction of the clove culture in Zanzibar, the first impetus was given to move to Tabora. The increasingly flourishing ivory trade around that time caused the economic boom of Tabora, which reached its peak in 1863 when the British enforced the restriction of slave imports and the prohibition of the slave market in Zanzibar on the Sultan Seyid Madjid in Zanzibar. These measures completely destroyed Zanzibar, i.e. the extensive plantations there, and the slave traders, so that the capital-owning Arabs who had been plantation farmers or slave traders set off for Tabora and bought ivory there for their own account. The lucrative business they made with their own capital prompted more and more Arabs to go there, so that the ivory and slave trade was completely taken away from the natives and they only came to the coast as porters. That time, towards the middle of the sixties, was the time of economic splendor for Tabora. But it was not to remain so for long. Among the increasing number of Arabs who appeared in Tabora, there were more and more who, without any capital of their own, borrowed it from Indians at enormous usurious interest rates and who were thus in most cases unable to meet their obligations because of the high interest rates or were unable to resist the temptations of a lavish life there, especially since the very arduous journey there easily led to compensation for living expenses. These people soon formed a large proletariat. They could no longer return to the coast as they were unable to pay off their debts without being imprisoned in Zanzibar and preferred to gradually pay off their debts from Tabora through laborious small-scale trade or to remain in Tabora as small-scale farmers, the Arabs had to undertake further and further trading expeditions, to Victoria Nyanza, to Karagwe and Uganda, to Ugunda in the south, on to Ukonongo, Usipa, Uemba at the southern end of Tanganyika, or to Katanga. Others crossed the Tanganyika at Kirandu to Marungu and Itana. The Arabs founded a main settlement in Ujiji on the Tanganyika and later went from there across the lake to Manjuema, where they founded Nyangwe and more recently settled in the middle Congo. What we saw for Zanzibar was now repeated for Tabora. The indebted Arabs in Tabora now borrowed goods from their compatriots there and for the second time a large number of them were unable to meet their debts. These debtors escaped their creditors to Ujiji and the Congo. Tabora's political flourishing dates from that time, for most of the Arabs who had settled there were pretty much detached from any connection with the coast and formed an almost completely independent political power. The power of the Arabs in Tabora had become increasingly important from about 1860 onwards. But in Unjanjembe to the south, to the north and east, in Ugogo, their influence was still quite insignificant, the more so in Ujiji and on the Congo. The development of trade was also different at that time. From the south, the Congo and Tanganyika, and the Victoria Nyanza, all the elves now poured into Tadora, which from then on took on the character of a staging post, which it has retained to this day. Either Arabs came from the coast to buy the ivory in Tabora or some large and rich Arabs, who had definitely settled in Tabora, bought ivory and sent it to the coast. The importance of Tabora for the Arabs is, as can easily be seen, quite incalculable. Tabora is the base for all of their inland ventures, for from there those further inland are supplied with everything they need to live and spread their power, namely barter goods, weapons and ammunition. In addition, there is another circumstance of great importance: as already mentioned, the porters, who make the whole trade possible, come from Unjamuesi and are very keen farmers who stay in their villages in the months of November, December, January, February, March and April to cultivate the fields. The

Trade trains, which take place in the remaining months, and therefore it is only possible to recruit porters from the coast as far as Tadora, because no Mjamuesi travel beyond Tabora, whether the caravan is led from the coast to the interior or continues from Tabora to the interior and returns there. The traders are therefore forced under all circumstances to recruit new porters in Tabora and to stay there for a while. It is so easy to see that all relations and relationships in East Africa, from whatever side one may look at them, always inevitably point to Tabora, not only for the Arabs, but also for the natives, who, if the Arabs do not visit them on smaller trading trips, are forced to exchange their need for cloth, beads, wire, guns and powder in Tabora for their products and for ivory. It can therefore be said that after Zanzibar, Tabora is of great importance for East Africa, and that even Zanzibar's power is retroactively increased by Tabora. The traders in Zanzibar are just as dependent on Tabora as the Arabs in Victoria Nyanza, Tanganyika and most of all Congo. The Congo Arabs can only avert their eyes from Tabora and conduct their trade relations exclusively down the Congo by giving up their independence. However, the entire power of the Arabs on the east coast is not based on the Arabs themselves, as they are numerically too weak for that, but on the natives, partly directly, where they have subjugated them, and partly indirectly, by obtaining their slaves from these natives. In all respects, therefore, Tabora proves to be of eminent importance. Tabora is the East African chartum. One can say that the whole of Central Africa belongs to those who own Tabora; its influence is felt even as far as the Sudan. If the German imperial government is now determined to hold on to East Africa, i.e. to transfer its borders definitively to Tanganyika, then circumstances make it imperative that we establish ourselves in Tabora. The objection that we have acquired enough land for the time being can only be raised by those who either have no knowledge of the circumstances or are fundamentally opposed to a further expansion of our influence. The seizure of Tabora is for the moment even more important than the subjugation of the southern provinces of German East Africa. I am even convinced that the occupation of Tabora would change the situation on the east coast at a stroke. It will make a tremendous moral impression on all those involved on the opposing side, i.e. the Arabs and the natives, and most importantly, it will not only completely paralyze the Arabs in Zanzibar, but will also put an early end to the uprising and place the Arabs in the interior entirely in our hands. We will get all Arab trade into our hands, and therein lies the great economic importance of Tabora for us, and the Sultan of Zanzibar would be forced, for better or worse, to give in to us on all points. The seizure of Tabora would also have an influence on England, on the one hand she would have to recognize Tanganyika as the western border of German Africa, on the other hand her influence on the Sultan of Zanzibar would be much less. The seizure of Tabora should not prove too difficult. An army of 7-800, at most 900 well-armed and equipped troops will not be able to put up significant resistance anywhere. The march would have to follow the well-trodden caravan routes via Mpuapua, through Ugogo, the Mgnndamkali, to Tabora. In Tabora itself, however, one would have to reckon with perhaps quite determined resistance from the Arabs. In such a case it would be advisable to move the base of operations to Ugunda to the south, a country whose inhabitants would undoubtedly be on the German side, partly as a result of the successes I myself have achieved there and partly as a result of Wißmann's treatment of the Wanjamuesi, who have supported him in his battles The prospects for the seizure of Unjanjembe and Tabora are good, can be seen from the fact that the chief of the Ugunda country, named Ndischa, which incidentally belongs to me according to local law and in which supremacy over the chief of his time has also passed into my hands, won a brilliant victory over the chief Sike of Unjanjembe in 1888, so that the Arabs there got into the greatest difficulties and had to mediate peace. The economic conditions of Tabora will have the same significance for us in the future as they do for the Arabs now, as the great fertility of the land (great by local standards), its central location, which results in the confluence of all products from the lake regions, the strong population, the tenacious adherence of the rulers to ways once recognized as practical, all work together. From a political point of view, Tabora is the only point from which it will be possible for us to develop power. It would be a very big mistake to choose any other place as a base, e.g. Ujiji or even Karema on the Tanganyika. The latter place is, by the way, the most unfavorable of the whole lake, without a harbor, off all caravan routes, in a sparsely populated area, and extremely unhealthy. In the event that we build a railroad into the interior, which by the way is only a question of time, it must be led from Dares=Salaam, as the harbor, via Mpuapua to Tabora into the interior; another line, for example directly to Nyassa, would be decidedly less recommendable. However, it is not within the scope of this discussion to discuss this. Under all circumstances, however, the imperial government should not hesitate a moment longer to undertake a major expedition to Tabora. It is high time, especially in view of the fact that Emin's withdrawal from the Wadelai will give the Arabs unlimited influence in the interior, which can only be counterbalanced by the establishment of a German military station, which would at the same time make our influence in the whole of East Africa unlimited. This would also put a stop to the English appetite for the lakes. Without a hinterland, German East Africa is almost worthless as a trading colony, and all sacrifices of human life and money would be sacrificed without equivalent. The transportation of freed slaves. (Conclusion.) According to Reichard, a station with 150-300 freed slaves would require an investment capital of 200,000 marks with a reserve fund of 100,000 marks, which, however, would only have the prospect of earning interest in the third year. As far as the question of location is concerned, we note from the outset that it will not be possible to find a site that combines all the desirable characteristics for our purpose. The soil should be as productive as possible and the climate such that it allows the white man to live there for many years without interruption; a location is desirable which provides a certain degree of security not only against raids but also against all unsettling and demoralizing influences from outside, which, on the other hand, makes it difficult for our pupils to run away in the first few years and for them later to exchange agriculture for trade. In terms of the colony's profitability, on the other hand, it would be good if the transportation of its products to the world market did not cause too many difficulties. - As you can see, it is in the nature of these conditions themselves that they are to some extent mutually exclusive, and we shall be satisfied if we find them united somewhere only in the majority. The immediate vicinity of the coast would have the advantage of doing away with the difficulties and costs of transportation which a station in the interior incurs both in its establishment and in the export of its products. Moreover, in the event of danger from external enemies, we could count on the rapid protection of our warships. But this exhausts the advantages of the coastal region. Its climatic conditions are on the whole of such a nature - even the vaunted climate of Tanga is only a relatively good one - that we should not hope to see the upper line in the same hands for a long series of years. And that is a very important point. But it would be almost as bad if the governor had to make frequent recreational trips. Secondly, on the coast we would be in the immediate neighborhood of the Arabs with their slave economy and their whole nature, which is contrary to a found culture. We must try to avoid contact with them as far as possible for the pupils of our colony The closer we finally stay to the coast, the greater the danger of escaping, the greater the temptation to run away after the expiry of *) Abridged reprint of a memorandum written on behalf of Commission V of the German Colonial Society.

the apprenticeship period, which was suggested above, to turn to small trade. If you want to avoid all these abuses - which are probably the most worrying - it is necessary to look a considerable distance from the coast. We have been thinking for some time about Usagaraland, especially the area of Mpuapua. It is highly praised both in the missionary reports - as is well known, the English church mission had gained a firm foothold here - and occasionally in the Blue Papers, and other reports agree with this: the climate is relatively cool, there is plenty of clean water and the soil is fertile. Although in 1887, according to the estimate of a missionary, one to two hundred slave caravans passed by Mpuapua on the road leading to the coast, which is said to be one of the most direct and best in East Africa, there is no sign of actual slave hunts in the immediate vicinity, the neighboring tribes are peaceful (apart from the predatory Wahehe in the south) and the German officials in Mpuapua have, according to the report of an English missionary, gained popularity and reputation. On the other hand, there are also reservations about this region. Recent events have shown that a rebellion originating on the coast can exert its pernicious effects as far as here, and the possibility that the more the Tanganyika regions are exhausted, the further east the slave hunts will move is by no means excluded. We are indebted to Dr. Bokemeyer for pointing out a completely different region where these abuses are also likely to disappear: Dschaggaland on Kilimanjaro. We confess to having approached a study of the literature on Kilimanjaro and its surroundings with decided mistrust, as we had estimated the danger posed by the neighboring Maasai far too high and the quality of the climate and soil somewhat too low. But a careful consideration of the whole situation makes this point in East Africa appear particularly suitable in various respects. First of all, as far as the Maasai are concerned, who border on Djaggaland in the south and west, the predatory character of this nomadic people is emphasized in all reports: they attack defenceless tribes in the neighbourhood on their expeditions, whereby they are particularly interested in taking livestock; Europeans who have ventured into their territory have not fared very well either. But Dschaggaland, which is very protected by nature, has hardly suffered from them for years; similarly, the inhabitants of Taweta on the south-eastern slope of Kilimanjaro have not been bothered by the Maasai since they once vigorously fought them off. Also, none of the travelers whose reports are available to us have been harassed by Maasai either on the way to Kilimanjaro or on the return journey to the coast. Johnston's information on the Maasai (p. 383. 400.508) is very instructive: "The relations of the farming tribes living around Kilimanjaro with the Maasai have now improved more and more, the raids of the latter have stopped before the artless fortifications of the mountain dwellers and both parties can now trade with each other on equal terms. - The section of the Maasai known as the Wakuasi (see above of Dschagga, around Aruscha, also at Taweta) has begun to lead a settled life. - Within a short time, these civilized Maasai will also be stronger in number and superior to the proud nomadic Maasai; in this way, eastern equatorial Africa will be opened up to safe and advantageous trade. In the worst case, the Maasai are neither as dangerous nor as bloodthirsty as the Arabs of Sudan. If forced to defend themselves, this people proves powerless against a pallisade because they have no guns and never throw their spears. We may gratefully acknowledge that Mohammedanism has not yet reached them and turned them into mad fanatics or faithless cutthroats, like their neighbors to the north and west." So much for Johnston. Our Hessel reports on the friendly intercourse of the Maasai at the stations of the German=East African Society. In this respect, therefore, concerns appear to be unfounded, especially if, when selecting the site, the natural humidity of the entire region is taken into account and *) Reichard also recommends the same region, op. cit. 3) In particular: Hefsel, Deutsche Kolonien in Ostafrika; Weiß, Reise nach dem Kilimandscharo; Jühlke, Erwerdung des Kil.

This is helped as far as necessary by artificial installations. As is well known, Dschaggaland itself stretches like a belt around the south-western, southern and south-eastern slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro, a plateau that rises slightly from about 1000 to 1800 meters above sea level and is torn by many ravines. It shares with all mountain countries the political division into a large number of small tribes. If these were at times involved in feuds, despite being related by blood and language, our friend Mandara, the ruler of Moschi, seems to have been mainly responsible for this. Seduced by slave-trading Swahili from the coast, he had set out years ago to plunder and ravage the territories of his neighbors. But since these attempts had failed due to the united resistance of the latter, his zeal for war cooled again and the former peaceful conditions took hold once more. Even during Johnston's presence, in 1884, there were not infrequent mutual disturbances; at a congress arranged by Johnston, all the Jagga states showed themselves inclined to a general alliance, if only Mandara, who alone had not sent an envoy, would pay a certain penance for his earlier incursions. Since then, German influence has had a calming effect. Four years later, Hessel was in no doubt that the peace would be permanent: all the unrest had not been caused by a conflict of interests, but merely by the encroachments of Mandara, who later became much wiser. All the Europeans who avoided the mistake of taking sides in the battle were met with the greatest kindness by the Wajagga. As a result of their aptitude and diligence, they have reached an astonishing level in agriculture for Africa and will, by their mere example, be an important factor in the education of our liberated people. Since v. d. Decken's report until the most recent one, which we owe to Hessel, only one voice has spoken about the efficiency of the Wadschagga people. And this is a very significant moment for our aims: The Wajagga are completely unfamiliar with the slave economy; through their energetic resistance to Mandara and the great willingness with which they accepted Johnston's proposal of an alliance against the coastal Arabs, they have shown how resolutely they oppose all efforts of the slave traders. The news about the climate and the fertility of the soil is no less favorable. The temperature, even in the hottest season, is such that Europeans can pursue their occupation without detriment to their health. The highest temperature observed by Weiß in June, i.e. at the beginning of spring, was 18½ degrees R., the lowest 11. -- While wheat and all northern plants thrive in the higher regions, the lower ones (on which we will be dependent due to our consideration for the Africans) allow the cultivation of bananas, corn, tobacco, which grows everywhere en masse and should be capable of refinement, cotton, sugar cane and coffee. In all of this, the most favorable experiences have been made partly by the natives and partly by Europeans; the majority of the plants mentioned already grow wild. According to Johnston, nothing would stand in the way of the production of cocoa, tea and vanilla. According to v. d. Decken, the bananas of Djaggaland are only surpassed in quality by those of Great Comoro. According to the unanimous observations of the travelers, the plants grow with astonishing speed. In addition to this wealth of vegetation, there are now a number of articles whose export will contribute significantly to a rapid return on the capital invested in a colony there. The horns of the very common rhinoceros can be bought for a few pence cloth and sold on the coast for 5 marks a pair. Hippos are also common and their hides, properly prepared, also sell well. But the great wealth of the region is based on its ivory, which is said to outsell every other kind on the Zanzibar market. It is obtained in such quantities that there is always more than enough to satisfy the many caravans that pass through the land between Nyanza and the Indian Ocean every year. The elephant is found by the thousands in the vicinity of Kilimanjaro, where it has become a complete inhabitant of the mountains. Johnston quotes 1-2 marks as the purchase price for a pound of ivory; on the coast it has a value of 6-10 marks. Wild animal skins are also an important export item - a leopard skin can be bought for goods worth 2-3 marks and sold on the coast for 8-9 marks - and hides, which are valued so low by the natives that they can be had for almost nothing.

Page 70

while on the coast they represent a value of 4-4 marks for every 7 pounds. In view of such favorable trade prospects, the fatal circumstance that the distance from the coast is so great appears in a somewhat milder light. Hessel needed 28 days for the outward journey from Pangani to Moschi, 17 days for the return journey, Weiß 31 days for the outward journey and 19 days for the return journey, which was severely hampered by rain. According to Johnston, the route Mombas=Moschi (through the English sphere of interest) is 4 days shorter. But both routes have the advantage over all other routes to Inner Africa that neither the climate nor the terrain presents the traveler with any particular difficulties. Dr. Friedrich Back. German emigration. The emigration question, this difficult problem of German colonial policy, has not yet come a step closer to being solved. If one asks why the imperial government is still hesitating to do something effective to control the flow of German emigrants, which has long been recognized as necessary from an economic point of view, the view that the government of a country that does not have its own suitable overseas colonization areas should limit itself to increasing the opportunities for gainful employment in the homeland as far as possible, but otherwise refrain from directly influencing those who are determined to emigrate, may be partly decisive. It can be acknowledged that such a view appears to be justified in every way, but on the other hand it must also be conceded that the assumption that a sufficient number of new employment opportunities could be created in the mother country, or that economic development would make emigration unnecessary at all, cannot be proven by the probable forecast. For this reason, private enterprises that set themselves the task of directing the flow of emigrants and are supported in this by sufficient capital and guided by good principles will undoubtedly sooner or later be able to count on a benevolent assessment and support from the organs of the state. In one respect, however, more could be done for the emigration question from the Reich side even now, even if any direct intervention in the control of the emigration flow is rejected, and that is the enrichment of the statistical material. Today, Reichowegen does not even initiate the necessary surveys of emigrants' occupations. It would undoubtedly be easy for the local authorities, who in most cases are very well informed about the circumstances of the natives, to make precise inquiries about the reasons for emigration as well as the means and final destination of the emigrants. From this knowledge it would then be possible to deduce with certainty something precise about the causes of emigration, whereas today the door is open to every conjecture. A further advantage would be that a more definite assessment of the true aims of emigration would be gained, and perhaps attempts could be made to find out what would happen to the people over there. For one can already assume for certain that many emigrants are mistaken about their future, much longed-for foreign homeland, and that they have wrongly considered their situation in their old homeland to be poor and unsatisfactory. Even if good statistics uncover many evils in our country, they must have a more salutary effect by eliminating deceptions and misunderstandings. By improving statistics, in addition to the thorough monitoring of the agent system, which already exists in the main today, and by benevolently supporting good colonization ventures, the Reich should initially be able to meet reasonable requirements for the benefit of the emigration question. In the main, however, it will always depend on the free association of capital and labour to form overseas colonization companies, which the government will support in a supervisory and protective capacity. Although German capital has so far shown itself to be reticent towards such ventures, this situation will not always remain so and a change must occur sooner or later, as there is a need and security in the colonization business to enable a profitable investment of funds. The German colonization companies now in existence mostly suffer from a lack of capital; when one hears that in five American countries the usual interest rate at which German colonists borrow the capital they need is 20 to 30 per cent, one can see from this single fact alone what a useful and high task German capital still has to fulfil in those countries where German settlements are relatively dense. There is no other way in which money proves to be more effective as an ethical force than when it helps to bring healthy colonizations into being or to free existing ones from the pressure of financial need in the right way. From the above points of view, the following considerations will attempt to determine whether certain generally valid propositions can be derived from experience, which can serve as a basis for assessing the question of emigration and can be applied in part or in full to every colonization enterprise with certainty; they are intended to provide a guideline for recognizing a settlement business as a good and expedient one in its basic conditions. Of course, this essay is only an attempt and, given the difficulty of the subject, is recommended to the kind indulgence of the reader. On the causes of German emigration. Almost all experts agree on one point, namely that one of the main motives for emigration is relative overpopulation. The population in Germany has grown to a greater extent than it has been possible to create new living conditions or expand the existing economic system to the same extent. Opinions differ, however, as to how the lack of space for the growing knowledge and skills in the fatherland can be remedied, and how the labor and capital forces that are taken away from the fatherland through emigration can be preserved, or at least not completely lost, or even act as competitors against the motherland in the new homeland. According to W. Roscher, the main motive for almost all emigrations of our day, to America, Australia, etc., is relative overpopulation: competition in the economic field, the oppressive overcrowding of most higher professions, the disproportion between our one-sidedly increased education and the narrowness of our spatial resources. According to Dr. Fabri, it is essentially the struggle for existence that causes mass emigration. Emigration is naturally strongest where wages are the lowest and where agrarian conditions are such that the field worker is not in a position to acquire his own property. Hübbe=Schleiden explains emigration by the fact that knowledge and skills are seeking utilization; an expansion of our national economic area alone is capable of ensuring the normal development of our national life and the prosperity of our nation. Professor Rein considers emigration to be the natural consequence of population growth in a country whose soil and industry do not, under present conditions, provide sufficient employment and earnings for this increase; he regards it as the outflow of a full cistern with a constant supply of water. Jannasch is of the same opinion; he does not regard emigration and colonization as arbitrary and accidental, nor as artificially created facts, but describes them in their present expansion as a necessary consequence of recent economic development. The continuing industrial overproduction of the European countries, with the difficulty of expanding the domestic market directly at the national borders, results in the necessity of seeking this expansion from afar. Added to this is the concern of our small rural landowners that, under the influence of circumstances, their children or certainly their grandchildren will fall into the arms of the proletariat. Our colonial politicians, such as Prince Hohenlohe=Langenburg, Dr. Hammacher, Dr. Miquel and others, unanimously describe German emigration as a historical fact that has existed in the past and will continue to exist, which must be explained by history, by our overall social and economic conditions. Since the need for expansion affects not only individual classes of earners, but, with the uniform growth of all sections of the population, all branches of employment and occupations are equally influenced by it, the cry of distress on account of overcrowding goes through the so-called working population no more or less than through the propertied population. As difficult as it is for the wage laborer to find the expected (or often sufficient) wages for his work, the owner struggles and struggles to maintain what he has earned "It is astonishing," says the report of the German Society in Baltimore of 1888, "what a number of well-trained and educated men and youths are trusting, although completely unfamiliar with the local conditions and the English language.

uninformed, in the firm conviction that immediately after their arrival they would be guaranteed a good job because of their knowledge. Too late, unfortunately, they only find that their illusions are not realized, and a few who have a found body, energy and strong will accept the situation and begin to work and may later obtain a position corresponding to their abilities in some cases; others, whose relatives are of means, write to them and ask for money for the return journey, the rest go into the country to increase the already strong element of "tramps". The statistical records on the occupations of the immigrant Germans in the United States also show very clearly that all occupational classes in the mother country must have contributed to these emigrants. According to the 1880 census, immigrant Germans were represented in all occupations. A few figures') may illustrate this in more detail. In that year, immigrant Germans were employed in agriculture: approx. 240000 as farmers and planters, 50 000 as agricultural workers, 8000 as gardeners and winegrowers, 1500 in dairy farming, 580 as shepherds, 400 as cattle breeders, etc. Under the heading "various professions" are mentioned: 7000 barbers and hairdressers, 1200 owners of eating houses. 4200 clergymen, 64000 domestic servants, 5000 employees in inns and restaurants, 4000 hotel owners, 5000 laundresses and washerwomen, 750 lawyers, 4000 musicians, 2700 government officials, 2550 doctors, 2400 restaurateurs, 4500 teachers and so on. Under trade and transport are listed, among others: 1000 agents without further description, 800 bankers and fund brokers, 3200 bookkeepers in stores, 17 500 salesmen in stores, 1600 traveling salesmen, 13 000 carters, 10000 railroad employees, 7000 housekeepers, 1800 milkmen, etc., 3100 pack porters, 2100 2700 clerks on horse-drawn railroads and sailors, 2000 salesmen and saleswomen, 20 200 innkeepers and publicans, 11 000 merchants without a specific name, 1700 shoe merchants, 2600 cigar and tobacco merchants, 3000 men's clothing merchants, 1100 drug merchants, 6000 manufactured goods merchants, 17 000 colonial goods merchants, 3200 wine and spirits merchants, 3800 food merchants, 600 land merchants. Finally, there is the long list of those employed in industry, crafts and mining, of which we only mention the most noteworthy: approx. 14,000 bakers, 15,000 blacksmiths, 1,000 bleachers and dyers, 1,100 bookbinders, 28,000 draughtsmen, 10,000 brewers, 3,000 brickmakers, 18,000 butchers, 600 building contractors, 12,500 cabinetmakers, 30,000 carpenters, 6,000 wheelwrights, 12,000 cigar makers, 1,600 clockmakers, 2,700 confectioners, 9,000 cooks, 1600 cotton spinners, 3000 unspecified factory workers, 4400 locomotive drivers and stokers, 700 fishermen, 1500 glassmakers, 3000 gold and silver workers, 2200 gunsmiths, 4400 saddlers, 1300 milliners, 9000 workers in iron and steel goods, 4000 tanners, 1000 woodcutters and raftsmen, 8000 machinists. 5200 factory owners and foremen, 3000 stonemasons, 12 000 bricklayers, 3500 millers, 9000 milliners, 10 000 miners, 10000 painters and lacquerers, 1600 instrument makers, 1200 gypsum workers, 800 lead casters, 3500 book printers and lithographers, 760 quarry workers, 5000 sawmill workers, 600 ship carpenters, 1400 silk weavers, 750 steam boiler makers, 37000 tailors and dressmakers, 4500 plumbers, 1500 cutlers, 2000 upholsterers, 1500 wheelwrights, 2300 wood turners, 3500 wool spinners. Unfortunately, no records are kept by the Reich on the occupations of German emigrants, a deficiency that should be remedied soon; we have to rely solely on American statistics on the occupations of immigrant Germans. These data must therefore suffice for our proof. At first, of course, the consequences of relative overpopulation will affect the bourgeois trades and professions, so that agriculture, crafts, trade and industry, and, of the learned professions, the medical profession, writers, lawyers, etc., will suffer first and foremost. Very soon, however, this will create a push towards the professions of permanent employees, since many (and in the prevailing state of need in the liberal professions, in this case all prudent people) prefer a small salary and a modest but secure position in life to the contingencies of a free existence on their own initiative. Since the assumption must now be correct that the effects of relative overpopulation permeate all strata of society equally, the influx into the professions of the fixed*) Compendium of the Tenth Consus (June 1, 1880). According to the publications of H. Engelbrecht in the Zeitschrift des königlich preußischen statiftischen Büreaus. Year 1887 p. 58 fg.
The fact is that the tax burden will not only be visible in certain categories of civil servants, but will affect them all equally with minor differences that vary according to the needs of the moment. It is only due to the favor of early circumstances that the excessive influx into the professions of permanent employees has not already become more apparent in its frightening reality. The training and expansion of our military system, the period of organization after 1870/71 in schools, the judiciary and administration has created an extraordinary demand for manpower in all subjects, which has still been able to absorb the rich influx of pre-trained elements to a large extent. But even now the learned young civil servant and teacher has to wait a relatively long time for employment and even longer for promotion; the higher and lower military candidates are becoming more and more concentrated and are taking possession of all possible and impossible civic offices; the lower teachers and civil servants, the tax and postal professions, there is almost no professional class of permanent employees in which there would not only be a surplus of pre-trained staff, but in which it would also become increasingly difficult to move up to a satisfactory salary level. This calamity will necessarily have to grow to the extent that the effects of the reorganization of 1870/71, which have so far made the enormous overcrowding in all civil service professions less noticeable, are likely to be brought to a halt very soon. The symptoms of relative overcrowding, the effects of which, as we have seen, are detectable in all occupational classes, manifest themselves everywhere equally in the dissatisfaction with the personal situation. For as soon as the difficulties of working life become too great, hardship and want will be the result. It must not be forgotten, however, that in the socialist tendency of our time there is a more than usual tendency to find one's own situation bad and inadequate without the proper examination and appreciation of other people's circumstances, and that it is a habitual weakness of the man who likes to blame the difficulties and adversities which no one is spared in the struggle for existence, even the self-inflicted consequences of carelessness and recklessness, on the peculiar social conditions in the home country. "A walk in winter," warns the German Society of the City of New Pork in its annual report for the year 1886, "in the numerous lodging houses, where an unclean night's lodging is supplied for 5 or 10 cents, must convince everyone that a large part of the inmates there consist of young people who have only recently immigrated and who, after vain efforts and after the last dollar has been spent, unfortunately regret too late the disastrous step they have taken in reckless exuberance despite all warnings and domesticity. "I can't be worse off in America than I am here. "So many people have succeeded, why shouldn't I succeed too! With these and similar phrases, the reckless man has allayed his concerns until he finally realizes that getting ahead in a foreign country is far more difficult than he imagined. It is astonishing how wrongly the local conditions are judged even by apparently educated people, of whom one should assume that they are better informed, and with what pretensions many appear whose knowledge justifies far more modest claims. The surgeon thinks he can utilize his knowledge in America as a physician, the seminarian as a teacher or pastor, the student as a journalist, the young economist as an inspector of large estates; the factory worker would like to improve the poor situation in which he found himself in the old fatherland as a foreman or supervisor in a large factory. There is no doubt that the majority of these emigrants underestimated the value of their former position in their homeland and to the same extent overestimated the employment conditions in the foreign country. All of these people have turned their backs on their homeland out of ignorance and error; they may have been motivated by the most honest desire to advance. It has already been indicated above that no records are kept of the emigrants' occupations by the Reich; only the emigrants who embark in Hamburg are recorded in the Hamburg statistics. German emigration in 1888, from German and, as far as is known, from foreign ports, amounted to a total of 98,568 persons; of these, 52,974 traveled via Bremen alone and 25,402 via Hamburg. The latter thus represent about 25 percent of the total emigration in 1888, of which we have precise information on the occupation. Of these emigrants, 8.9% were employed in agriculture and forestry, 16.7% in trade and commerce, and 0.8% in the so-called liberal professions (doctors, teachers, journalists, artists, etc.).

Page 72

The remaining 42.1% comprised the family members of all those mentioned above. If we want to apply this ratio to the total number of emigrants in 1888, then approx. 15,000 persons were withdrawn from forestry and agriculture, 28,000 from trade and commerce; furthermore, 26,000 wage laborers and servants, 28,000 persons who did not state an occupation, and approx. 1,200 persons belonging to the so-called free professions emigrated. Since the family members were evenly distributed among the above professions, whereas the wage laborers, servants and persons without a profession for the most part did not take any family members with them, these two categories may well be reduced by 6000 each and this number may be added to the emigrants in forestry and agriculture. Also among the emigrants belonging to trade and commerce there is usually a larger number of single persons, especially in the commercial sector, so that this figure can also be reduced by 6,000 in favor of forestry and agriculture; it can therefore be assumed that forestry and agriculture experienced a deduction of at least 33,000 persons in the previous year. In the years 1871 to 1888 inclusive, according to the official records of the Reich, 1,769,297 persons emigrated; this figure does not include the German emigrants from individual foreign ports, for immigration to the United States of America alone from 1871 to 1887 (i.e. 1888 not included) amounted to 750 persons from Germany in 1884. During this entire period, it was not the overcrowded provinces that accounted for the majority of emigrants, but West Prussia, Posen, Pomerania, Hanover and Schleswig=Holstein, i.e. the relatively sparsely populated provinces with predominantly agricultural production, that showed the highest frequency of emigration. In the elements of forestry and agriculture, the country is reluctant to lose the pillars of the national state that have grown together with the native soil; the evil of the emigration of our small farmers and rural workers can only be controlled by material remedies to the extent that it is possible to keep the small farmers viable, to give the rural workers sufficient employment, and to create sufficient space for both categories in their striving for independence and in their natural increase within the borders of our state. If we estimate the effect of these measures highly enough and add to this the number of those who, converted by instruction, renounce exaggerated claims and are happy to be modest with little at home, then we have done what is conceivably possible to limit emigration. However, any surplus remaining above this amount will have to emigrate, as the natural release of surplus forces, as proof of the power of expansion in our people, which cannot be contained and encapsulated by human command and by law within the randomly drawn national boundaries. It testifies to the found sense of our population that the surplus forces seek a satisfactory existence outside the national borders, which the homeland cannot grant them; if this were not the case, vagabondage and rural proletarianism would have to grow rapidly in an alarming manner. In order to limit as far as possible the loss which the state suffers through the departure of such valuable inhabitants from the fatherland, and also to take steps on the part of the governments which are aimed at increasing the number of small landowners. In the east of our fatherland, the parcelling out of large estates has recently been added to the cultivation of heaths and moors. It remains to be seen to what extent this can meet the existing needs and remedy the prevailing imbalance between the rapid increase in the rural population and the inadequate basis of their existence. If, however, many experts agree that this means of relief will only have a very slow effect and will not eventually be able to fully satisfy the need, there are two important reasons for this view. On the one hand, the high land rent and the intensive form of our present-day agriculture caused by it are a serious obstacle to small-scale farming, so that certain local conditions are necessary for its preservation; on the other hand, the large landownership with all its forest, hunting, fishing and other rights rightly exists in our country, and some of it can certainly be taken away, but certainly not enough, since large-scale farming is just as necessary for the whole as large-scale industry makes it really efficient. No matter how quickly the parcelling out of larger estates and the reclamation of moorland will proceed, our rural population will continue to have to shed a surplus of labor, and if this labor cannot find work and good wages in domestic enterprises, as was the case in the seventies with the development and increase of industrial production, it will naturally choose its way across the sea to foreign countries. In addition to forestry and agriculture, there is an almost uniform overcrowding in all other branches of employment and professions. According to the thorough studies of Jannasch and Hübbe=Schleiden, our area of consumption has long been too narrow compared to our actual production, let alone our production capacity and necessity. Hübbe=Schleiden calculates that if emigration (1860-1879), considered as the measure of the surplus forces of a people with a limited economic area, had been in direct proportion to exports, Germany's exports would have been nine times as great as those of France; but they were not half as great. The export of England should have been only half to ¾ as great as that of Germany, and yet it was 5½ times as great. Jannasch regards it as our foremost task to utilize the mobile labor force and capital in the interests of our own economy, under the further point of view abroad, in such a way that these productive forces are at the same time the cause for increasing the consumption of our industrial products. (To be continued.) Dr. Velow on Mexico. The "Germania", which is published in the city of Mexico, published a reply to the article by Dr. Below in No. 30 of the "Deutsche Kolonialzeitung" in its No. 196 of January 4, from which we, in order to give the opposing view its due and not to give the impression that we identify with Dr. Below's statements, also quote from the article. Below's statements, we reprint the following: Much of what the author finds reprehensible about the conditions here is the truth and it is only to be regretted that it is mixed up with so many misrepresentations. There is still a lot, an infinite amount of braid in the country, who can deny that? The author will hardly be able to argue with the assertion that Mexico is in the most decisive regression. On the contrary, it is clear to anyone who wants to see without prejudice that Mexico has resolutely and with conviction steered into the path of progress and must necessarily persevere in it. However, if one wants to apply the American standard to every step in a country like Mexico, inhabited by 10 million people and only recently developed, the comparison is unfavorable. If one also considers that the economic interest of the North American is nothing more than the meanest greed, a disordered national appetite, one will also understand why the Mexican is not too passionate about North American progress and does not forgive the local Germans their Anglo-Saxon kinship. What are we to make of people who deny foreign interests any concept of justice? How can we love people who only recognize the "mine" but simply ignore the "thine"? From our point of view, we also see that things are not going as they should in the "great world republic" and that not insignificant parts of it are in a state of obvious decomposition. We notice there in a relatively but rapidly decaying organism a moral decomposition of the most malodorous of all putrefactive processes, and Mr. Below, as a physician, knows that such growths are for the most part incurable and tend to end in the destruction of the organism. Who doubts that there is a huge difference between over there and over there? This is so clear that we can hardly understand how a sensible person can take the desperate trouble to draw parallels that should not be drawn, to make comparisons where no comparison can be made. For even if 100,000 liberal, progressive Americans come into the country, Mexico will still be a long way from becoming North America. So far we have not been able to notice much of the surprising efficiency and energy of the Americans. Their industrial and mercantile ventures have for the most part taken an unfortunate course for lack of specialized knowledge and knowledge of the country, and only the exploitative businesses, such as leather insurance, lotteries and canteens, show relative prosperity. The American thus seems to us to be less productive than exploitative, and such a population would be a misfortune for Mexico. If, in spite of these negative characteristics, the American has succeeded in raising his republic to such heights, he has to attribute two-thirds of this success to foreign immigration, whose constantly renewed labor force he has been able to exploit skillfully. Without them, "the world republic" would have remained a rather dismal one. This skillful exploitation is the full-blooded American's own greatest merit, while his own personal work is barely 10 percent of the profit. A constantly renewing, eternally living, spiritual and physical force is an incommensurable capital, and the ugly ingratitude of the American, who especially in recent times has mainly aimed at the persecution or suppression of the German language in the public schools, consists in the fact that he eynically denies it.

Page 73

Their railroads are all of them poorly constructed and even more poorly managed, so that even in this field, where they are known to have authority and a monopoly, they have not been able to accomplish anything extraordinarily astonishing. The Americans have set up some new things here, but we don't know exactly what the reason is - "it doesn't flow", whether it's the "palace clergy or the general obscurity", in short, things don't work. Instead, a legion of American beggars and "hitchhikers" flooded the capital during the latter period, who, when they weren't drunk out of their minds, made the streets unsafe and begged the "greauers" in an outrageous manner. The German=American element is unfortunately also strongly represented here. Let us now turn to the Mexican trade, which Dr. Pelow mistreats in such an unforgivable manner. Here again the exaggerations are mixed up with the truths. If only he had contented himself with simply placing the indisputable truths alongside the facts! They are serious enough on their own to be accepted even by the most obstinate pigtail man. There was no need for embellishment. The author accuses the merchant class of having spread darkness about the country and its circumstances for the purpose of depriving foreigners of insight. This accusation stems from Dr. Below's complete ignorance of Mexican trade history. Let us look backwards twenty years, and twenty years are a second in the life of a nation. To the north, Mexico was cut off from any connection through deserts. It took 2-3 months to transport goods from Chihuahua to the capital. The transportation of goods to and from Veracruz took almost a month, correspondence five days. Passage traffic could only be managed by diligences and was dangerous and disproportionately expensive. Veracruz was the only gateway to the Republic. These communications were interrupted for six months of the year, either because of the rainy season or the revolution. Under such conditions, Dr. Below demanded bright lights all over the country! Under such abnormal conditions, trade suffered most of all and had to laboriously find its own way in the "darkness". Since trade itself lived in general darkness and had to overcome the same difficulties, it could not "spread light", because the medium, communication, is part of the improvement. In the chaotic confusion, trade had enough to do to protect its own interests and could not concern itself with trade policy clarifications. And what use would they have been for a country that went from one revolution to another? We have been enjoying the blessings of peace and the railroads for 15 years and since then there has been "much light". To our knowledge, commerce has never complained about "the light" and certainly has no interest in restoring the former darkness. We will not come back to the myth of the robber gangs, which the trade pays for, because Dr. Below himself does not believe in it. However, the fact that even the consulates of the various governments have been indulging in writing false reports and doing "dark work" is so colossal and monstrous that we have quarantined this allegation together with Dr. Below for the time being. Dr. Below suggests that the consulates should be staffed with professional consuls as a remedy against this dark work. .. . Every transition from one situation to another, with completely changed living conditions in its wake, especially when it occurs suddenly, brings things to light that lend themselves to contemplation and criticism, because a certain number of existences flounder like fish on the sand. The author makes a great shout about this, although he can see the same thing every day everywhere, especially in the United States. Some things in Mexican commerce were very much in disarray; some things survived completely, others were even upheld against all found reason; in its common interests it was disintegrated and fragmented by petty jealousies and business envy. Then came the new era with steamship lines, railroads, banks, falling silver prices and created new, very different conditions of existence. Elements that do not have the necessary strength of character and elasticity to adapt to them have to give way. Thus, for example, the German trade in Mexico has lost two thirds of its sphere and is in danger of losing the last third as well. We are in the throes of a new formation, but we have told Dr. Below that we do not need an obstetrician. We will do it ourselves. The author blames the one-sidedness of local trade, which, according to him, deals purely with customs, exchange, goods and money transactions, does not operate any factories and is turned away from industry. In addition, of course, there are the "vora olfigies" of the North American merchant, who thinks and acts quite differently. When the doctor speaks of Mexican trade in general, he is wrong, for who is to blame for the many manta= and estampado and woolen goods factories, which can brazenly compete with their counterparts in the United States in terms of solidity, grandeur of equipment and operation, and even surpass them in some places. As far as we know, they belong to Mexican, Spanish, French and, albeit in small numbers, German trading houses, which in turn are integral parts of the Mexican trade. Factories employing between 1200 and 4000 workers are not uncommon in Mexico. All these factories cover the demand for staple articles of the textile industry so completely and have so completely wrung the hand of the European and American that today there is little or no room for the import of European goods. The needs of the ordinary Boike are fully met by their own industry.
A criticism from missionary circles about the activities of Paul Reichard. We have received the following from Mr. Mission Inspector Zahn: It is only belatedly that I see that you referred to me in No. 3 of the Deutsche Kolonialzeitung. Regarding a letter in which Professor Dr. Schweinfurth expresses his appreciation of Paul Reichard, you remark that this judgement is all the more important "as Paul Reichard has often enough been denigrated in missionary journals". You do not provide any evidence for this assertion; you only cite me as an example by quoting a statement I made in the Allg. Miss.=Zeitschrift (1890, January, page 27), which is supposed to mean without right. "To denigrate someone is to give them a bad name. I do not wish to denigrate anyone and must deny that I have denigrated Mr. Reichard. I regret that you only reproduced the last of my sentences. Please allow me to remind you of the context. After Arnot's report, I had said a few things about Msidi and also justified or at least excused him a little. Then I continued: "But his wars were basically only wars of conquest and plunder; the spoils were slaves, and Arnot has a lot to say about the misery that these wars bring. In passing, we may well recall that apart from Arnot, only the Portuguese Senhor Jvens and the Germans Dr. Böhm and P. Reichard got to know Msidi. The latter two considered themselves entitled to support Msidi in his war efforts in order to achieve geographical goals. Dr. Böhm has since died. Father Reichard, one of those African travelers whose misfortune and misfortune it is to shed much blood, later had to flee from Msidi. Then came the sentence you quote: "It is very regrettable that men like Paul Reichard, who can only carry out their explorations in Africa with bloodshed, are allowed to act as advisors at home on how to treat Africans, free and slave. So where is the denigration? The fact that Mr. Reichard not only had bloody clashes with the natives at Msidi, but often as well, will not be disputed. Do not believe that this was a misfortune for Mr. Reichard! Anyone who is forced to take a human life on his own behalf without holding an official office will not easily be relieved of the pressure of heavy responsibility. And the life of an African should be as sacred to us as that of a European Are these hostile encounters not also a misfortune for Africa? The Europeans have succeeded in stirring up almost all of Africa to fight against them. Among the many abuses for which this is responsible, not the least is that explorers find themselves as warring foreigners in the interior of Africa. They make the way more difficult for themselves, but even if they get by themselves, they make the work of their successors more difficult and create difficulties for the quiet work without which Africa will not receive the blessing of European culture. The experienced African Westbeach gave Arnot the good advice: "Make a good name for yourself among the natives! To the detriment of themselves and Afrila, many travelers now have the misfortune of having to use violence and making the name of the European hated in Africa. Perhaps I am not entirely alone when I say that it is more than a misfortune, it is an injustice. Whether Mr. Paul Reichard had a right to all the warlike clashes on the journey into Africa and the return journey, I leave undiscussed now. It is enough for me to recall that he aided the Msldi in a war that was waged for the purpose of conquest and robbery. The Enropean foreigners were hardly in a position to judge whether the war was just or unjust. So they could not be justified in taking offense. Nor would it have occurred to them if they had not believed that a different morality applied to Africa than to Europe, that the tribes or small tribes there had no rights which the strong were morally obliged to respect. This disregard for the rights of the natives is another reason for so many difficulties encountered by the Eurepians. Of course, if one takes the Arabs as a model, there is no need to respect the law. But if you want to plant written culture, you have to start by respecting the right of the native. Even those who cannot agree with this judgment will admit that it is, if not wrong, at least unfortunate to have so many hostile encounters with the natives in the pursuit of peaceful intentions. When Mr. Wissmann was commissioned to pacify East Africa, I took the liberty of saying publicly that the best guarantee of his success was that, as was said at the British National Ansoclation in his honor, he had twice crossed Africa without firing a shot in his defense. In Africa he plays a miserable part who does not know how to be an authority. And in Africa, as with us, it is a sure testimony to a man's ability to exercise authority if he is rarely compelled to use force. In my experience, it is always the clumsy ones in Africa who talk so much about the need for coercion and force. Mr. Reichard's experiences seem to testify that he had to resort to violence only too often. F. M. Zahn. We have informed Mr. Paul Reichard of this article, who has asked us to include the following reply. Reply First of all, I declare that in the following I do not intend a defense, for qui s'excuso s'accuco, but only a rebuttal of Mr. F. M. Zahn's attacks. I would not have entered into a polemic if Mr. F. M. Zahn had not

nial newspaper" for the publication of his omissions. Mr. F. M. Zahn says right at the beginning of his letter that he has "somewhat justified or at least excused" the chief Msirri, he does not bite Msidi. But Mr. F. M. Zahn, with his vividly developed sense of justice - at least he always emphasizes the injustice done to the Negro, but never that done to the white man - seems to have to condemn me completely. Let us take a look at the famous chief Msirri, whom I had the opportunity to get to know sufficiently during my stay in his countries from October 29, 1883 to September 25, 1884. Msini is one of the cruelest, most insidious, most vicious, most cowardly, most treacherous and most wanton blacks that Africa has ever produced. He is almost proverbial in Katanga because of his mendaciousness. No report, however beautifully colored, will be able to wipe away this fact. Msirri is in the habit of burying people alive, smiling coldly and gruesomely mutilating all parts of their bodies. He immediately used a feather hook I gave him as a thumbscrew. During the siege of Katapang he succeeded in seizing the brother of that chief by a very vile betrayal and then had his skin flayed off while he was still alive and a bedstead covered with it. I saw such things happen to him with my own eyes. - And Mr. Zahn takes up the cudgels for this hallunk! He should be a little more careful in his own interest; he is only showing that he himself has lost the ability to judge African things, which he dares to deny me. As far as my struggles are concerned, I have the following to say in reply, provided, of course, that Mr. Zahn does not also see an injustice against the blacks in the fact that expeditions are undertaken: Mr. Zahn says: "Whoever is compelled to take a human life on his own behalf, without holding an official office, is not easily relieved of the pressure of heavy responsibility. In the interior of Africa, where the traveler is outside the sphere of power of any European state and therefore cannot be protected by it, he is his own master and king and even his own supreme authority. He owes protection to the people who entrust themselves to him as porters and soldiers. It happens very often that travelers are attacked, and I am not the only one to whom this has happened. In such cases, I allow myself to make use of the right of defense to which I am entitled, and I will not allow this right to be abridged even by Mr. F. M. Zahn. Even missionaries have had to resort to weapons more than once. But to allow oneself to be trampled on by the Negroes is partly a matter of character and partly a matter of taste, and if Mr. Zahn would prefer to be beaten to death in a given case, that is his business, but he cannot reasonably demand the same of others. I had no desire to die as a martyr without selling my life as dearly as possible. Besides, my life, like that of a white man in general, is much more sacred to me than that of a black man. As for Mr. Zahn's sayings about African morality and Arab patterns, my pride and dignity forbid me to go into them further. As far as Mr. Zahn's opinion of our participation in the Mstrri's war campaigns is concerned, I deny him any judgment on it, for he lacks all knowledge of the facts. Mr. Zahn's judgment here is one-sided, in that he lends his opinion only to the Mfirri, whose words were conveyed to him by Mr. Arnot. Whether I am considered clumsy in the eyes of Mr. Zahn is a matter of indifference to me, and it gives me the greatest satisfaction that more competent men than he judge me quite differently. Likewise, Mr. Zahn is not in a position to judge the justification of my battles at all; I reject this too in the most decisive manner and explain to him that I regret nothing of what I did in Africa and would do exactly the same today, even without Mr. Zahn's approval. Mr. F. M. Zahn tells of an escape on my part from Msirri. He is also ill-informed about this. I left Katanga in broad daylight at 7 o'clock in the morning with flying flags, playing music, accompanied by the war songs of my people, for the sole reason that I no longer had any barter goods. In four battles I repulsed the hordes of the Msirri with bloody heads, after the brave chief had not dared to let me attack other than far from his capital. If Mr. Zahn believes at the end that I exercised no authority in Africa, it only serves him that tribute was paid to me everywhere. My own people positively adored me and are still eagerly awaiting my return. The chief Ndischa of Ugunda has even repeatedly sent me a message to Europe, asking me to return there, which does not indicate any great ineptitude on my part in the treatment of the blacks. On the other hand, Mr. Zahn will be able to hear from more than one traveller to Africa that the over-indulgence of missionaries always made a worse impression on the regent than an energetic but just approach by determined explorers, and that where very indulgent missionaries or other travellers have gone along, much greater difficulties have arisen for those who follow than where an energetic approach has created respect for the whites. For me, this declaration puts the matter completely to rest, and I will not enter into any further dispute with the "peace-loving" missionaries in this matter. Paul Reichard.
News from the Society. - The Society's committee held a meeting on March 4 under the chairmanship of Mr. Hofmann, Minister of State, at which a number of business matters were dealt with. It was reported that the formation of new departments was progressing well and that new departments had been formed in Oberfrohna, Rostock l. M. and Dirschau. - The Berlin department held its annual general meeting on February 28. After the opening of the meeting, the first chairman of the department, Privy Councillor of Justice Professor lr. v. Cuny, reviewed the activities of the department, which had been very energetic and extensive in the past year. He particularly remembered the so-called protest meeting and the meeting to justify the need for a direct German steamer connection with East Africa, also referred to the petition to the Reich Chancellor for the establishment of the aforementioned steamer line and then spoke about another branch of the department's activities, which until now had been limited exclusively to the board. The Board of Directors submitted a number of amendments to the Society's budget, which could provide more funds for practical purposes. At the same time, the Executive Board made various proposals of a practical nature to the Society's Committee, relating to the support of German citizens wishing to go to East Africa, the establishment of schools and the secondment of technicians. The committee's reply to point l was in favor, to point Il postponed. The question is to be considered after peace has been established in East Africa. According to the presentation by Mr. Regierungsbaumeister Wiskow, the department currently has 858 members and has held 35 lecture evenings, 30 men's evenings, 4 discussion evenings and 4 ladies' evenings in the past year. 4 discussion evenings, 4 ladies' evenings and 5 large lecture evenings. The library has 110 volumes and 30 maps. According to the treasurer's report, art publisher C. Grunert, the department had a cash balance of 4031.34 marks on January 1, 1889. Of this, 2000 marks were transferred to the "German Women's Association for Nursing in the Colonies". The Emin Pasha Committee received the remainder of 2031.34 marks. The income for the year 1889 amounted to 11,951.60 marks, which was offset by an expenditure of 8366.44 marks, so that on December 31, 1889 there was a surplus of 3585.16 marks. In accordance with § 6 of the Articles of Association, the following five members of the Board of Directors were elected by lot: Art publisher (. Orunert, Marshal v. Biberstein, Julius Kunae, government architect Wiskow and government architect Storck. Reg.=Assessor Angerer proposed re-election by acclamation. This was accepted. The 5 gentlemen mentioned were thus re-elected. The department decided to express its gratitude to the Chancellor for having refused his consent to the intended sale of part of the property of the German Southwest African Company to a Dutch-English consortium. - A very interesting lecture on his voyages along the East African coast was given on February 7 by Mr. Wangemann. After visiting the Somali coast, he came to the wide and safe Manda Bay, the advantages of which he described in detail, particularly emphasizing the fertility of the Witufestland, especially in Wange. In the speaker's opinion, the Swahili people, which arose from a mixture of Arabs and Negroes, have an important future for East Africa and are distinguished in many ways from the other natives. In the lecture, the mouth of the Umbe River with the mountains of Usambara visible in the distance, the mouth of the Wami and Saadani, where Bana Herr used to be Wali, the bars of the Kingani River, the stately Bagamovo with its 300 white houses surrounded by countless huts and its 25-30 thousand inhabitants (a "little Paris") and then Dar=es=Salaam were discussed in more detail. This place consisted only of ruins. Bushiri had burned it down. Its name evoked wistful memories in the speaker. It was here that Lieutenant Landfermann, who had fallen in battle against the rebels, was buried for the last time, while all around him the enemy bands swarmed out fighting and threatening and could only be prevented from disturbing the funeral ceremony by setting up a ring of archers. The coastline to the south of Dares=Salaam is of less interest to us. At best, Kilwa could be considered, but it has unfavorable landing conditions due to the existing mud bank. The lecturer concluded his interesting, vivid description with a warm appeal to the patriotism and willingness to make sacrifices of his listeners. The land described belongs to us Germans only externally for the time being. We first have to conquer it for Germanity. Our allies here are not the Arabs and Indians, but the natives, especially the Swahili. We must accommodate them. They have never felt comfortable and secure in the slave economy. Let's give them the security and peace they need. We must not only send people who want to conquer and administer or just earn money; we need to send conquerors who get close to the natives personally, stay with them, teach them written and German customs and put themselves at the service of charity, like the missionaries and nurses do. The Darmstadt department organized a lecture evening on 3 February, at which Count Eberhard zu Erdach von Aschaffenburg spoke about the history of the secession of the Fuego-American colonies from Spain and the formation of "the republics under Bolivar". The speaker, who is very familiar with South American conditions through his travels and studies, treated his interesting and comprehensive topic in a concise and poetic manner in an hour-long lecture, which was loudly applauded by the selected audience. Later

Mr. Marinepfarrer Wangemann gave an extremely attractive and illustrative lecture on East Africa for the benefit of the German hospital in Zanzibar, which also brought in a considerable contribution from here. - Karlsruhe Branch. On March 5, the ordinary annual meeting of the local department took place under the chairmanship of President Grimm. Mr. Grimm presented the annual report, in which he gave an accurate account of the events of the past year, both in the colonial development of Germany and in colonial association life. The accounts were approved and the current Board of Directors was unanimously re-elected. As before, Mr. Grimm held the chairmanship, Major (ret.) Carl Hoffmann was appointed treasurer and Mr. Goldschmidt, District Court Councillor, secretary. In addition, Dr. Balentiner, professor at the technical university here, gave a lecture on the German Togo Colony, in which the history of the acquisition and the promising nature of the country, which is still so little observed even in colonial circles in Germany and is now already the size of Württemberg and Baden together, were expressed in a very interesting way. The first chairman of the department, Prof. Dr. Kleinert, who rendered outstanding services not only to the formation of the department but also to its subsequent development, died at the end of February. The Colonial Jdee has lost a committed and active colleague in him. On February 5, the department held a very well-attended foundation festival, to which its own illustrated festival newspaper contributed a great deal. Erfurt department. On Wednesday, March 5, Mr. Paul Reichard gave a lecture on his experiences in Africa to a large audience, which was received with much applause. The lecture was followed by a convivial meeting in the club room in the Hotel Kronprinz, where several gentlemen declared their membership. Small announcements. (The flag hoisting of the British East African Society on Manda and Patta has, as we expected, not been recognized by the British government. So apparently things will remain as they are for the time being. We only want to hope that the Imperial Government will now energetically advocate that these two islands be secured for us, and that above all the question of the Beledsoni Canal will be resolved in a manner favorable to our interests. Without the Beledsoni Canal, the Witn area has no commercial value for us, as we would be cut off from the Tana, about whose development potential both Dr. Peters' and Pigott's reports agree, if the British-African company were to establish itself there. The Sultan of Witn, at the request of the German government, vacated the canal built by his ancestors, although when the treaty on which the alleged right of the Sultan of Zanzibar to the Beledsoni Canal was based was concluded, none of the parties to the treaty had assumed that the canal ran into Zanzibar territory. The wording of a treaty, however, especially if it is based on an irrium, is not alone decisive for the interpretation of international treaties (German Emin Pasha expedition.) The news that French missionaries had met with lr. Peters at Tana is now also refuted by Borchert in the following telegram received by the executive committee of the German Emin Pasha Committee from Zanzibar: "English and French report quite incorrect, mistook me for Peters. The latter is probably in Kavirondo (bay in Victoria=Nyanza), I am sending a message to Peters through Uganda missionaries. Borchert. (In Lome), German Togo protectorate, an imperial postal agency was established on March 1. (Franco-German customs agreement on the slave coast. According to the agreement concluded between Germany and France on the introduction of a customs system in the reciprocal territories on the Slave Coast, the German and French possessions on the Slave Coast are to form a single customs territory without an intermediate customs border in such a way that one and the same customs duties are levied there and that the goods cleared in one territory can be imported into the other without being subject to a new duty. Imports into the Community customs territory are subject to the following duties: Genever per crate of 8 liters from 0.64-1.60 Marks, Kum per liter from 0.09 3/10-0.08 Marks, tobacco per kilogram 0.20 Marks. Powder per 100 pounds English 5 Marks. Rifles per piece 1 Mark. Salt per ton of 1000 kilograms 8 marks. Customs duties can be levied in German, French and English money. The different kinds of coins are valid as legal tender in the same way as in their country of origin, so that on the one hand all German, French and English gold coins as well as the French silver five-franc pieces and the German one-thaler pieces (3 marks), as long as they are legal tender in Germany, are valid as legal tender without restriction, while on the other hand the German, French and English coins need only be accepted in payment up to a certain amount, namely the German coins up to 20 marks, the French up to 50 francs and the English up to 40 shillings. The officials of both countries have to exchange the silver coins paid into each other's coffers every month, basing the exchange on the value ratio determined by the tariff (1 mark - 1 shilling - 1 franc 23 centimes). The new customs system comes into force at the same time in the German and French territories, namely from March 15, 1890, and is introduced for a period of one year. If the contracting parties have not given notice of their intention to terminate the contract six months before the expiry of this period, it shall be deemed to be tacitly renewed for a further year, and so on until the expiry of the following periods. This agreement will in any case help to alleviate the reproaches made by the missionaries against the German government for not taxing the spirits trade in the colonies sufficiently. The new rates of duty have doubled everywhere compared to the earlier treaty of 1887. While a crate of jenever (8 liters) used to pay a duty of 0.32-0.80 marks, depending on the alcohol percentage, the duty has now been increased from 0.64-1.60 marks. Rum, which used to be subject to a duty of 0.15/10-0.4 marks per liter, now has to pay 0.31/10-0.8 marks. In addition, the duty on tobacco, powder and guns has been doubled and a new duty on salt has been introduced. Nevertheless, the duties on spirits are still significantly lower than those in Cameroon. (With Dahomey) France may soon be involved in a serious conflict, as the King of Dadomey is determined to expel the French from the coast. Six Europeans are captured by him in Wheidah. (From South Africa.) The dispute in the Transvaal between the Dutch Boer element and the English colonists, who have recently increased in number, has led to regrettable outrages on the part of the English gold diggers. President Kruger was given a very unfriendly reception in Johannesburg by a hostile crowd and demonstrations against the government took place in the market square, during which the flag of the Republic of South Africa was torn down from the government building and destroyed. (From South West Africa.) The planned sale of part of the German Colonial Society for South West Africa did not materialize. The Reich Chancellor has refused to give his reserved approval to the contract in question. - (Richard Jordan), the secretary of the Imperial Commissariat for the New Guinea Company, second lieutenant of the reserve in the 2nd Guards Regiment, died on February 25 in Soerabaya (Java) at the age of 36. - (From East Africa.) Major Liebert and his escort arrived in Zanzibar on March 2. - Premierleutnant Krenzler, company commander in the Schutztruppe for East Africa, has, according to the "Schwäb. Merk.", been appointed by the Imperial Reichskommissar, Major Wißmann, as district chief of the entire Usambara district, provisionally including the stations of Tanga, Tangata and Pangani. - Ewin Pasha has arrived in Zanzibar on a Wißmann steamer. He is still quite weak, as he suffered a severe skull fracture, two broken ribs and a sprained hip when he fell, according to Dr. Brehmer, the ward physician at Bagamyo. - The final posts, as the "Nat.=Zig." the German East African Society has received unusually favorable and promising reports on the development of its territory. On the occasion of a round trip to the northern coastal areas undertaken by Society Director Vohsen in association with Major Wißmann, peace negotiations have taken place with the local chiefs and agreements have been concluded with numerous tribes concerning the cultivation of commercial crops. Everywhere the renewed confidence of the indigenous population, as well as of the Indians and krauts, was reflected in the fact that the places abandoned during the uprising saw a strong influx of people and lively building activity. Dar=es=Salaam, for example, which had declined to 850 souls, already has a population of 3000 souls again. In Bagamovo, all the large European companies have bought up premises and the place is rising extremely quickly. Traffic in Tanga is constantly increasing. The German East African Company is building a large caravanserai in Bagamoyo to accommodate 5,000 people, together with extensive warehouses, as well as large factories in other places, and hopes to make considerable profits from the current traffic. In short, the reports are such that the company can look forward to the future with full confidence. - A telegram from the "Times" in Zanzibar reports that Major Wissmann is about to attack Baua Herl in Saadani. - Ehlers is on his way back to the coast after visiting Mandara and concluding new friendship treaties along the way. German influence in Usambara is now firmly established. - The Reich Chancellor has received new reports from Major Wißmann, the first of which describes the very fierce battle for Bana Heri's entrenchment on January 4. For the first time, the existence of a religious moment on the part of the Arabs is mentioned, as they were encouraged to fight by the prayer leaders. The second report describes the agreements with the British East African Company regarding the import of weapons. The import of breech-loaders is strictly prohibited. (Regulation of jurisdiction over the natives of the Marshall Islands.) The "Reichsanzeiger" has published a supreme decree according to which the Reich Chancellor is authorized to issue the necessary orders for the regulation of jurisdiction over the natives of the protected territory of the Marshall Islands. The provisions of the law concerning the legal relations of the German protectorates, which regulate civil law, criminal law and judicial procedure, including the judicial constitution in the protectorates, do not, as is well known, refer to the natives, but the Emperor has been authorized to subject the natives to German law and German jurisdiction. From this point of view, the Imperial Decree of July 7, 1883 transferred jurisdiction over the natives to the New Guinea Company for its territory until the end of 1897, and the same now also applies to the Marshall Islands. It is in the nature of things that the Empire must endeavor to extend its influence more and more.

Page 76

to extend more to the peoples who have become its wards, even if prudence dictates that this regulation should be applied slowly and cautiously. - (In No. 318 of January 18, the "Reform", published in Joinville, opposes the statements of Mr. C. Bolle in No. 38 of the German Colonial Newspaper and criticizes the author's statements, namely that the provisional government consists of political ruffians, that it is possible that the State Councillor Silveira Martins has protested against the state of affairs and that his arrest was made out of fear of the inhabitants of the province of Rio Grande do Sul and the Germans in the southern provinces who are behind him, and, thirdly, that the composition of the present provisional government will probably not last long. The reform, on the other hand, claimed that the provisional government consisted of highly competent statesmen and that Brazil had never been as well governed as it was today. The arrest of Silveira Martins had been necessitated by the duty of self-preservation, as he had conspired against the existence of the provisional government. The dissolution of the present government would be the greatest misfortune that could befall Brazil, but the government stands firm and secure and handles the power of government with rigor, but also with wise moderation. As the Reform attaches importance to its views being made known here, we are printing extracts of its communications. In addition, the committee of the Society (see No. 3 under Communications from the Society) has expressed the view that the future development of conditions will not worsen the situation of the German settlers at any level and that emigration to southern Brazil appears no less recommendable today than in the past, as soon as the political conditions have taken a firmer shape. Ostasiatischer Lloyd brings a letter from Sumatra (on the selection of planters) for the colonies, in which the correspondent advises most urgently that planters should not be sought in Europe but abroad, and that attention should also be paid to German farmers and foresters, as a professional staff would save a lot of training costs. 1Page 39 reads: Rietsontein, eine der denischen Aneheeie wos dade Eingänge für die Vibliothek. Given the limited space we have for book reviews, it will not be possible to discuss all works in detail, but we never fail to recommend new colonial writings, which are assigned to our library by the authors and publishers, to colonial friends in word and deed, for which the administration of the library is given ample opportunity by our members. Once again, we would like to express our sincere thanks for the books donated to our library. Receipts in February. AIIgeweise Nifflenszeitschrif1 Juhrgang 1003-06. Heit 1-3 den 1097.

From the German Emin Pasha Expedition. In No. 5 of the German Colonial Newspaper we provided our readers with a report by Mr. O. Borchert on his journey up the Tana River, as well as a report by Mr. Weiß from Lamu, in which the latter's more distant travel experiences were described in detail according to the statements of Galla people and information provided by Mr. O. Borchert. The managing committee of the Emin Pasha Committee has now sent us the following further report by Mr. Borchert for publication. Although it essentially contains only the facts already known from Weiß's essay, we believe that we should not withhold it from our readers for the sake of the importance of the matter. It shows that the report by the Swedish missionary Hiddenström, according to which Borchert did not even reach Korkorro, was incorrect. The report reads: "Zanzibar, February 25, 1890: I take the liberty of informing the esteemed committee of the German Emin Pasha Committee that I have arrived here today, somewhat strengthened, from Lamn on a Sultan steamer, with the intention of using the French mail to continue my journey on the 3rd of next month.*) For the time being, I apologize for not reporting to you immediately after the end of my expedition; I was unfortunately unable to do so due to my weakness and will only be able to report briefly today, as writing is still quite difficult for me. Before I was able to set off from Kinakombe, 4 Somali fell ill, which meant that my troops for a journey to the Wagalla region consisted of 2 Somali, and, unfortunately, some of my porters also fell ill, leaving me with only 6 porters, as the famous Witu soldiers and porters had already run away from me in Kulessa, cowardly, when they heard that the Wagalla wanted to avenge the death of their sultan and fight the Ndugu (brother) of the bwana Doctari. My motto was: "Move forward quickly", my duty dictated that I should obtain reliable information on the spot about the fate and whereabouts of my revered chief and my dear comrades according to their wishes; if possible, I should catch up with them myself. Before I left, I considered it my duty to inform my followers that the famine prevailing on the upper Tana, the march through a desert some 18-20 miles long and the fact that we were traveling with our small expedition, which was short of guns, into Wagallaland, where our friends were not, made the journey difficult and dangerous; anyone who did not want to come along should report to me. But they all said to me in unison: "Lord, wherever you lead us, we will go with you," and none of the small troop of 16 people escaped. After overcoming extraordinary difficulties, especially the lack of water in the desert and the desperate heat, as the people had to leave, I happily reached Oda=Born=Ruva, where, to my great joy, I proudly found the German flag waving on our station "von der Heydt=Haus", which is beautifully situated on the Tana River (as can be read neatly with Olfarde on a plaque in front of the house), but unfortunately no letter in the house, only the cannon, a few chairs and a rifle case, which I had brought with me. I stayed here for five days *) According to a dispatch received in the meantime, Mr. O. Borchert arrived in Cairo, but had to go to the hospital on medical advice.
and in Oda=Galla=Oda (above), as well as Korkorro (below). Making inquiries. My stay was like being on a powder keg, about 1000 Wagalla moved around me ready for war, I had all in all 4 guys who could shoot. Only my more than proud appearance at the first Schauri, with the Sultan Sadi, probably saved our lives! - Dr. Peters was supposed to have been murdered up there in battle by the Somali, according to the first news in Germany about Peters' death. Dr. Peters, that much I could now ascertain for certain, never had a fight with the Somali, on the contrary, they are his friends. My first dispatch sent to you at the time to refute the completely invented rumors of murder and war that had been circulated was absolutely correct and has now been confirmed. Around November 10-15, Dr. Peters and Mr. v. Tiedemann marched in good health with 8 camels, 6 donkeys, 1 horse, about 60 porters, including about 20 new slaves who had escaped from the Wagalla and 25 Somali, as well as some mians (boats) loaded with goods, along the course of the Tana, which is supposed to lead to Baringo, accompanied by three Wagalla from Oda=Born=Ruva to the Wakore= (Maasai=) border, where, after days of negotiations and after having firmly promised the Maasais that he would pay for his needs with goods and not pay for any of the goods, he marched to the Wakore= (Maasai=) border. he was given permission to march through the Maasai country, he then marched off towards the great lake and said that he wanted to go very far and that he had already reached the lake. I have heard this news from all sides, unanimously from Wapokomo and Wagalla, in Ooa=Galla=Oda, Oda=Born=Ruva and Korkorio. I believe you, Dr. Peters is following the Telekironte, according to his great nature, and from statements to me I am convinced that he is still not sitting in Ukamba and buying donkeys even after three months, he wants to get to Emin Pasha quickly. His stay in OdaBorn=Ruva was conditioned by the lack of exchange articles. I also forgot to mention that the Massals have the most beautiful donkeys and he naturally covered his needs there. The content of the dispatch sent to you now will, and in my opinion must, turn out to be true. In the next mail I will report in detail on my return journey, which I made to Subakini, struggling with death due to a lack of suitable food (as the Mau that was supposed to bring it to me had capsized in the Tana), and from where I then returned to Lamu completely exhausted - I will take the liberty of reporting all this in detail in the next mail, as my lack of strength unfortunately prevents me from doing more today. My acquisition of the land of Agunda. In No. 5 of the Deutsche Kolonialzeitung, a small but very noteworthy reference is made by Dr. Wiechmann=Ludwigslust to the view officially expressed by the German government on the western borders of our East African possessions. According to this, it seems almost self-evident that the German sphere of interest is delimited by Tanganyika, as is generally assumed in public opinion. Within this sphere of interest I made a large territorial acquisition at a time when Germany was not even thinking about colonies. I repeatedly tried to assert my claims to this territorial acquisition in the Foreign Office. In any case, it can be asserted that any recognition of these

Page 78

rights would be of great service not only to me, but to the whole colonial cause, in that it would make it clear that Germany wants East Africa to be regarded as bounded by Tanganyika. What the acquisition of those countries and my rights are based on will be explained in the following: At the time, I was part of a scientific expedition sent out by the "African Society" in Germany, which, following the undertakings of the Association Internationale ofricaine under the King of the Belgians, had the task of frequently establishing a station from Lake Tanganyika in the country of Unjamuesi. I made the journey at my own expense. After overcoming endless difficulties, we four Europeans, Mr. v. Schoeler, Dr. Böhm, Dr. Kaiser and myself, succeeded in acquiring some huts in the small village of Kakoma in the country of Ugunda and thus establishing the station. Mr. v. Schoeler then left Kakoma after just one month's stay and returned to Europe. The chief of Ugunda, Mlima-ng-ombe (literally the cattle herder, loosely the good shepherd of the people), was downright hostile towards us at first, until his ailment, drunkenness and dropsy, prompted him to try us as well as his waganga (medicine men, sorcerers), but too late, Mlima-ng-ombe died. Before he died, he recommended his eldest sister Ndisha to turn to us and seek our help. Rdischa was entitled to inherit as chief and emerged as the new chief after Mlima-ng=ombe's death in the secret election of the great people of the kingdom. In most Bantuneg tribes, the chieftainship is passed on to the female line, i.e. to the sister or her descendants, who may of course include a man. The direct descendants of the deceased are excluded from succession to the chieftainship. Of course, it can happen that a descendant who is not always legal or entitled to inherit the chieftainship is usurped by force or influence. However, the new chieftain must always pay tribute to neighboring powerful chieftains in order to secure their goodwill and consent to ascend the throne. The settlement of such matters always takes a long time and can take years. The tribute payments are always reciprocal and no relationship of dependence is created. In addition to Ndisha, Kassita, the son of Mlima-ngombe, made claims to the succession. The success of this will be described below. Only the chief Sike of Unjansembe was entitled to tribute payments in the settlement of the succession in Ugunda. Other chiefs were out of the question due to their powerlessness. In addition to Sike, the Arab governor Shiache ben Rarib of Tabora had to be considered, who had great influence in Unjanjembe but was powerless in Ugunda. Kassita turned there, while Ndisha called on our help, prompted by the deceased chief, who urged her to secure our support, and also by the fact that we had gained a large following in Kakoma through our behavior and had gradually increased our force. Furthermore, Ndisha rightly believed that the fact of our presence would be enough to deter other hostile chiefs, especially the Mirambo, who claimed to be friendly to Europeans, from attacking Ugunda. But the main thing was that she was counting on our generosity, given what she considered our enormous wealth, thinking that it could not be difficult for us to pay the Hongo or tribute. In order to secure our help, she made us a number of advantageous promises. Above all, she wanted to make us co-rulers, a promise she could easily make, since if we made Ndisha chief through our efforts and paid the tribute to Sike and Schiache, this would fall to us all by itself and we would also gain ownership rights to the whole country. According to local law, the sovereignty and ownership of the lands pass into the hands of the person who pays the tribute to the foreign chiefs. If the new chief pays this tribute himself, all rights are transferred to him alone; if someone else pays the tribute, he assumes all rights alongside the chief and even has sovereignty over this chief. The intention to make us co-rulers had already been expressed by the great men of the empire. Ndisha also wanted to bear the costs of our relocation from Kakoma to Ugunda, which was necessary in case we were willing to accept her plans. Then she promised to have the station building erected by hired labor and her slaves and subjects were to cultivate extensive fields for us. Without having any idea of the difficulties that lay ahead of us, we agreed to everything in the interest of the task we had been given in Europe and immediately began to exert all our influence in Ndisha's favor. On all sides, both in Ugunda, where Ndisha still had many opponents, and in Unjanjembe, we distributed gifts to influential people. In Unjanjembe, Rdischa had few prospects, partly because she disliked her, but also because Ndischa had a legitimate husband and a female chief is not allowed to be married there so that her husband cannot exert political influence. But the worst thing for her was that she owned practically nothing apart from slaves. Kassita had approached Sike and Shiache directly after Unjansembe, although according to law and custom he had no claim to the chieftainship. However, as he had some supporters among the Arabs and did not come empty-handed (he had some elephant teeth and 18-20 slaves), he was welcomed with open arms. There was also an opposing candidate, who was only favored in order to extort higher tribute from the chief entitled to inherit. After a few months, when Unjanjembe and Tabora had finally convinced themselves that we Europeans as well as the inhabitants of Ugunda were firmly against Kassita's candidacy, Schiache and Sike extracted all his wealth from him. Then they gave Kassita a lot of valuable gifts, and under the pretext that Shiache and Sike wanted to make him chief, they sent him to Ugunda, after Shiache had perjured himself on a book that had been passed off as a Koran to Kassita, who had become suspicious. On the way, the unsuspecting man and his uncle Kahumba were stabbed to death. The severed heads of the two were then brought to us and Ndisha in Ugunda with the remark that we should regard them as proof of the change of opinion in Unjanjembe and that from now on our efforts to make Rdisha chief would be supported. I had previously made repeated trips to Tabora to conduct the negotiations. However, given the sluggish manner in which such matters were conducted, a quick solution to the question was out of the question. Despite assurances to the contrary, the Arabs continued their agitation against us and, like the negotiators, caused us untold trouble, difficulty and great loss of time. Gifts had to be distributed, especially to the negotiators, who reported the truth to my side, but were constantly on the move. Rdisha himself, Shiache and Sike constantly demanded "something to eat, because they were hungry." On top of this, the man was constantly interfering with our plans in a foolish way. Finally, we became so tired of the months of delays that we moved from Igonda to Ugalla to give up the hunt and demanded the gifts and the tribute already paid to Sike and Shiache back. This was now highly unpleasant for all concerned and when it was seen that we were determined to stick to our conditions of making Ndisha chief in the shortest possible time, otherwise we wanted to leave Ugunda altogether, we were even granted the demand that the German flag, which had already flown in Kakoma, should be hoisted in Ugunda. Envoys and negotiators of the Ndisha and the Arabs and Sikes continually appeared with us in Ugalla and when we had been guaranteed that Rdisha would be made chief within a month and we had agreed to pay another tribute, Rdisha was finally appointed chief on July 25, 1882, exactly one year after the start of our negotiations, and we, Dr. Böhm, Dr. Kaiser and I, were also appointed chief. After we had gone through a lot of strange ceremonies, we, Dr. Kaiser and I, Dr. Böhm was absent at the time, were installed as chiefs together with Rdisha in a solemn, large popular assembly in front of the gates of the capital, and publicly proclaimed as such and called upon to recognize our rights, i.e. pointed out to them with the emphatic emphasis that Ugunda belonged to the Europeans from now on, that they paid tribute and that they even had sovereignty over Rdisha, since we had made Rdisha chief. We were recognized as chiefs by both the Wagunda and the Arabs. We actually exercised all the sovereign rights of a chief. These sovereign rights consisted of power over life and death, decisions on war and peace, we took part in all consultations, used people for voluntary services by having them cultivate our fields and build houses for us free of charge. The land of Ugunda belonged to us as chieftaincy property, because otherwise land is inalienable. In addition, we could make use of our rights by wearing the so-called Kirangua, a small shell plate, or a copper bracelet forged in a certain shape. We also had to wear the honors of a

Page 79

chief. Our supremacy was most eloquently expressed when we forced Ndisha to make a public apology for her insubordination against us. She had to bend her knees before us according to the custom of the land and hand over a hoe, a goat and a slave, symbolically indicating her submission. As already mentioned, Ndisha, as a female chief, was not allowed to be married. Her husband therefore had to leave the country. However, the Arabs, Sike and the Wagunda were unable to do this before Ndisha was installed until we intervened and expelled him. A female chief is considered a man and as such has the right to choose any number of women, Wagori as they are called. But since Ndisha or any female chief remained a pasture, the women chosen had to be male, and Ndisha chose six to seven young boys aged 17--20, who from then on were regarded as women, had to dress as such, had no voice at all and wore no woofs. A highly original custom We made the most extensive use of our rights and succeeded in establishing great peace and security in the land of Ugunda, so that the Wagunda were very reluctant to see us leave. On my return from the interior, where we had traveled from Ugunda to Katanga (I was the only survivor), I transferred my sovereignty to the Rdischa by proxy, reserving all my rights in the event of my return at the end of the previous year, I received a letter from the Reichskommissar, Major Wißmann, in which he informed me that a tribute payment for me had arrived on the coast from Ugunda in the form of ivory from Ndischa. Unfortunately, this was lost or stolen in the turmoil of the uprising. This is probably the best proof that Ugunda really belongs to me. All rights to that land have been transferred to me alone, as the dissolved "African Society in Germany", represented by Dr. Böhm and Kaiser on our expedition, has renounced all rights there. At the same time as the events in Ugunda described above, other events were taking place in the Ugalla of Merupambala and Madjiraguma. I formed a blood brotherhood with both chiefs of those countries and handed over tribute to the former in order to protect his country against the notorious Mirambo, and to Madjiraguma for the same purposes as Rdischa, i.e. to enable him to ascend the throne, so that both were also confirmed as chiefs through our mediation, one of them as a new chief, the other as such. This gave us, or rather me, exactly the same rights as in Ugunda, so that the whole complex of lands bordering directly south of Unjanjembe, the country in which Tabora lies, belongs to me by right. I therefore only insist on my good right when I claim those lands as my property, which right of ownership I have bought for myself through great sacrifices of money, time and effort.1 Paul Reichard. *) On the question of the delimitation of the sphere of interest, the following red is of interest, which confirms what we said in No. 24, 1889, about the intentions of the English government. It is printed in the blue book Germany and Zanzibur of 1888, was addressed to the English ambassador in Verlin on July 2, 1887 and reads: "Baron von Plessen came to the Foreign Office on the 22nd and informed them that the East African Society had expressed its concern to the German government that Stanley's Emin Pasha expedition, after fulfilling its actual purpose, might be used to establish English protectorates in the hinterland of the German sphere of interest or to prepare the way for this. The German government did not share this fear, added Baron v. Plessen, since the main task at the negotiations in October 1886 on the delimitation of mutual interests was the establishment of a demarcation line, in the north of which England was given a free hand, while the same was conceded to Germany in the south. England had expressly undertaken not to acquire any possessions in the south, not to accept any protectorates and not to hinder the spread of German influence there. However, no specific border line to the west had been fixed, but the German government was of the opinion that England would in future give it a free hand in the territories to the south of the Victoria Rvanza, as well as in the territories to the east of Tanganvika and Nyassa, and that it would restrict itself to opening up the lands to the north of that line. As, however, it was rumored that No. Mackinnon had not contributed so richly to Stanley's expedition merely for philanthropic motives and, moreover, that the telegraph now reported that he was negotiating with the Sultan about the customs acquisition in Mombas, Germany considered it appropriate to make a clear presentation of its views to the English government. In consideration of this communication, I instruct Your Excellency to inform the English Government that Her Majesty's Government has the same opinion.
The Great South.*) The Rufiji=Ulanga Line. The time is gradually approaching when Major Wißmann will tackle the last part of his original task of forcing the southern part of the East African coastal area to obey the Sultan of Zanzibar and to respect the German flag and German interests, and the blood of the Germans spilled at Kilwa will finally be avenged. Naturally, the main aim will be to occupy the important ports of Kilwa Kisiwani, Kilwa Kivindje, Lindi and Mikindani, which, with the exception of the two Kilwa ports, should offer little resistance, and to secure the hinterland, which, however, need not be nearly as extensive as in the northern part, especially as the Arab element has always been in a defensive position against the natives here and has only established a few insignificant settlements in the interior. It will therefore probably be possible to confine oneself to securing the coastal areas, which are of primary importance for trade, and thus secure the basis for further economic activity. The southern part of our protectorate seems to be particularly suitable for solving the problem of creating connecting routes to the interior, at least for the route to the northern end of the Nyassa. The priority of the idea belongs to Count Joachim von Pfeil, who first pointed out the importance of this river as a basis for our colonization efforts in a very readable booklet after his visit to the Ulanga and Rudsiji. Captain Wharton and the officers of the English warship Shearwater have already examined about 25 geographical miles of the Rudsiji and published a satisfactory map. This shows that the Simba=Uranga estuary, one of the northernmost of the many estuaries of the great estuary, is to be regarded as the best entrance. The Englishman Beardall,*) who traveled the river on behalf of Said Bargash in 1880 and 1881, entered the river on a dhow through this estuary. However, as the river - it was early December 1880 - was exceptionally shallow, the dhow often got stuck, so that the boats soon had to be used, of which the expedition had two, an eight-oared and a four-oared gig. The first large ferry station was about 25 miles from the coast, as most of the slave caravans crossed the river here, as was evident from the number of large boats (27) in good condition. The riverbank was flat, flooded during the rainy season, covered with tall grass, but fertile and particularly suitable for rice cultivation, which is widely practiced here and produced good harvests. The current was very strong, but the river had become so shallow due to the months of drought that the crew had to unload the loads at one point and pull the boats across the shallows. The same maneuver had to be repeated the next day until the expedition reached deep water again on December 15. The river was 300 pards wide here, sails were set and the journey went swiftly, only where sailing was impossible, the strong current gave them so much trouble that they had to pull the boats, which, as Beardall points out, was neither an easy nor pleasant task, as the banks were overgrown with high bushes. This method of progress had to be used several more times, although the afternoon breeze came to the rescue, as the river was 200-400 pts. wide at home for long stretches, and the expedition thus reached Korogero on December 30th. A certain guarantee is, as we well know, given by this, but if the German Government accepts such vague assurances, it may every day have the same points of difference in East Africa as in South-West Africa, where an English note has also settled the border question. With the English pressing northward, in view of the settlements in the Schire area and the action of Consul Johnston at the northern end of the Nyassa, we need other guarantees! D. R.

where the Pangani Falls provide a destination for shipping. This area is much haunted by the Mahenge, who regard this land as a "slave park" where they get their supplies. They are too clever to depopulate the area all at once, but make occasional raids, burn some villages and drive away a few slaves. As a result, some of the Wasoma hide with their crops on the low islands, which are numerous in the river, and enjoy a fair degree of safety here, as the Mahenge are afraid of the crocodiles. The coastal traders from Dar=es=Salaam, Kisiju and Kilwa had already penetrated this far, as Korogero is the meeting point for the trade routes from Dar=es=Salaam, Mboamatschi and Kisiju to Mahengeland and from Kilwa to Ugogo and Unjamwezi. Beardall assesses the land itself quite favorably in terms of its fertility; the soil is good, rice grows in great abundance and cotton would thrive. About the river itself he writes that it has a width of 100 pards to a quarter of a mile and the average speed of the current is three miles an hour. "I do not think," he continues, "that it will be very suitable for navigation, with the exception of native canoes, and possibly of shallow boats, which, when loaded, have not more than two feet draught, for with the great width the river is very shallow, and navigation is often difficult on account of the sandbanks and other obstructions." The land along the river is well cultivated by African standards, as both banks are dotted with small villages. Many of the natives wear the clothes and jewelry of the coastal inhabitants and claim to be Mohamedans, although they have no mosques or rituals, but follow their old pagan habits of burning sorcerers, witch trials, etc. Most of the people understand Swahili. Most of the people understand Swahili and have lively connections with Kilwa, which supplies them with the necessary materials for copal, rubber and rice. When Beardall was in this region, he had difficulty in obtaining provisions, owing to the very unusual drought, but in favorable seasons the country is rich in the produce of agriculture. The river is not navigable between the Pangani and Schuguli Falls, a distance of 60 geographical miles as the crow flies, the banks there are rocky and, where not overgrown with forest, sparsely vegetated. Beardall did not pursue the Rusiji, which is only called that above the Shuguli Falls after the confluence of the Uranga and Luwego rivers, but returned to the Pangani Falls in six days' march and found his cutter in good condition at Korogero on February 11. The rainy season had arrived, the river was about two feet higher than on the journey upstream and so he reached the mouth of the Kikunya, which lies to the north of the mouth of the Simba=Uranga, in a few days without any obstacles. Summarizing the results of Beardall's investigations, it appears that the river is navigable over a distance of more than 160 geographical miles, albeit with difficulties in the dry season, and that shallow-draft vessels are required to enable navigation at all times. The area is partly rich, but depopulated by the slave trade, the natives are no better and no worse than average in these parts of Africa. The Rusiji was then navigated in the spring of 1885 by Count Joachim Pfeil on the stretch below the Pangani Falls to near the mouth. He gave the following account of this journey: "From a distance, the Rusiji is only recognizable by the exceptionally sparse gallery forest that lines its banks. Its banks here are low, mostly sandy and, according to the natives, its floodplain is enormous. The width of the river is very considerable. It often flows in many branches, which surround large islands covered with forest and in other places with reeds. Most of the islands are inhabited by people who mainly fish. I went down the river in a boat I rented and found that the current was quite strong in places, but not the same everywhere. In one place, close to "Korogero's" village, it was almost dangerous for a log boat in which I was traveling. However, any European boat could safely navigate the river. In the beginning, the southern bank was higher than the northern one and seemed to be more densely populated. Later, the northern bank became higher and even rose to an approximate height of 40 feet (11 meters) above the river. In general, the depth of the river was such that shallow craft could navigate it comfortably. In places the depth was very considerable. However, the Rudsidji riverbed is not a constant one. The river carries huge masses of sand, which are often piled up to form long and high islands. However, the enormous *) Petermann's Mitteilungen. Volume 32. 1886: The exploration of the Ullanga region. Vion Joachim Graf Pfeil. Page 353.
The river's enormous volume of water nevertheless finds a way through the sand, so that there are always channels through which a vehicle of shallow depth could find its way. (Conclusion follows.) The German emigration. (Continued. As soon as the intensive development of industrial activity has reached its climax, there will be a continual surplus of labor which will go abroad as the population increases. This phenomenon is so evident in the considerable share of German emigration accounted for by trade and commerce that relative overpopulation must be regarded as the main cause of emigration in all those branches of industry which, together with forestry and agriculture, make up the great bulk of our emigrants. The main motives for colonization relate (according to Roscher) with some completeness to the four main areas of human life: family, property, state, church. And the same author teaches that all mass phenomena in history must be explained by a combination of self-interest and ideal. No one today will assume that oppression of faith or ecclesiastical distress would be present, which could induce the inhabitants of our country to emigrate; on the other hand, one cannot close oneself to the realization that the demands which the state makes on its citizens, the many excessively increased burdens, compulsory schooling, compulsory military service, state and municipal taxes, etc., are a cause for some emigration. etc. have caused many an emigrant to leave his native country, or at least made it easier for him to decide to leave what was and will remain dear to him for so long. These reasons, which so readily suppress the pleasures, goods and advantages which the educated fatherland offers equally to all its citizens, are then in many cases reinforced by false ideas of the salvation of freedom and by socialist reveries. To the same extent, the temptations coming from over there from the "new world" also have a seductive effect and make many a well-meaning person, who is not at all lacking in advancement, work and bread, resentful of his ancestral homeland. In many cases, emigrant Germans send their relatives the money for the crossing, which is often done in the interests of the former, who then want to make use of their relatives' labor for their own benefit. These evils cannot be remedied by instruction and warning; they call for stricter supervision and control, an organic regulation that eliminates the abuses of emigration and recognizes the salutary and beneficial nature of our people's capacity for expansion and the need for the free development of surplus resources. We summarize the causes of German emigration in the following sentences: German emigration can only be explained as the expression of German nature and German character in connection with German history and development 2. German emigration is mainly caused by relative overpopulation, the effects of which should be reduced somewhat by better distribution of land ownership, and even more by expansion of our economy, especially the sales area of our goods. 3. on the other hand, German emigration is due to grievances. It is not uncommon for emigrants to be bribed by self-deception and enticement. It is therefore the rule today that the goods and pleasures at home are underestimated and the conditions of life in the foreign country overestimated, a false view which is perniciously increased by the socialist movement of our time. Every German emigrant believes he will improve his personal situation and hopes, without any scrutiny, to find greater freedom and independence in the foreign country than he enjoyed in his homeland. Unfortunately, this fatal error continues unabated due to the lack of organized supervision of emigration. Goals of German emigration. As long as overseas emigration has existed in our country, it has continued to flow to the United States of America. The year 1888 has remained faithful to its predecessors in this respect, and in spite of all warnings that the United States

Page 81

The fact is that the conditions of existence are already beginning to become more difficult for the individual, and in spite of all efforts to divert the stream of emigrants to the Latin countries of subtropical South America, only a very small fraction go to other parts of America and other parts of the world. One feels tempted to ask, does Providence intend the better by pushing the bulk of our emigrants to the United States? From 1871 onwards, since the foundation of the German Empire, which marked the beginning of a new epoch for our emigration, when it was no longer the Prussian, Bavarian, Saxon, Swabian, no longer the "German Michel", but the German as such who went abroad, carried by the consciousness of being a member of a great ration, from 1871 to 1888 inclusive, according to the statistics of the Empire, 1769 297 persons emigrated from Germany; of these 1618816 persons went to the United States. In the same period 4780 persons went to British North America, Brazil 33443 15599 other parts of America Australia 16841 Africa 4047 1086 Asia It is evident from these figures that, apart from a small fraction, the flow of our emigration is absorbed by the United States of America. According to the American emigration lists, the number of German immigrants is always higher than our Reich statistics. This can be explained by the fact that a number of German emigrants, for example all those who evade compulsory military service, embark for America in foreign ports, about which the information in the Reich statistics is lacking. According to the American publications, in the same period, excluding the year 1888, for which the figures in the American reports are not yet complete, a total of 1,884,710 Germans immigrated to the United States of America in the 17 years from 1871 to 1887, representing over 28 percent of total immigration. German immigration is by far the largest of all other nationalities, exceeded by English-speaking immigration from England, Ireland and Scotland combined by only 2 percent. Immigration to the United States in the years 1871 to 1887 from Germany amounted to 1884710 persons, England and Wales 913371 Ireland 906 271 Sweden 405 442 persons, 246700 Italy Norway 232 168 Austria 211174 Scotland 187 121 154 864 Russia (excluding Finland). France 105,047 Since the immigration statistics do not contain any information on where Germans prefer to go within the United States, a picture of the distribution of Germans in the country can only be obtained from the census reports. The last census of June 1880 contains a summary of the distribution of those born in Germany, i.e. those who immigrated from Germany to the state in question, whether directly or after an intermediate stay in other states. If we now look at those states in which the immigrant population born in Germany in 1880 exceeded 10,000, the following breakdown emerges: Increase in population - decrease in population since 1870 California 861694 42532 12 833 Connecticut. 15627 3184 622 700 Illinois 235986 32036 3077871 Jndiana 80756 2700 1978 301 Jowa 88268 22 10 1624615 Kansas 996 096 28034 15260 Kentucky 30413 1648 690 Louisiana 939946 17475 1437 Maryland 45481 1564 934943 Massachusetts 16872 1783 083 3802 89085 Michigan 1636 937 24942

This fact, as well as the increase in the number of Germans in those states in the years from 1870 to 1880, indicates that it can be assumed as a rule that the descendants prefer to go to places where they already find a strong tribe of compatriots.*) Individual states must even have a distinctly German character. For example, immigrants born in Germany make up 14 percent of the population in Wisconsin, 8.5 percent in Minnesota, 7.7 percent in Illinois, 7 percent in New Pork, 6.9 percent in Nebraska, 6.9 percent in Ohio, 5.7 percent in New Jersey, 5.4 percent in Jowa and Michigan, and 6.9 to 2.2 percent in the other states. The fact that in some of these states the German population must have predominated for a long time becomes even clearer if we consider the population in these states as it was around the middle of this century. Franz Löher mentions Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Jowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and Upper Canada as states that could become particularly German. Furthermore, Pennsylvania and part of New York on the one side, Texas on the other, would become the German liaison states to the sea. This would be the ruling center between the waters of the Ohio and Missouri, while north of it would be the Pankeestates, south the slave states According to the Boston data, the number of Germans in the United States in 1844 was 4888,632 souls, while the total population in that year was 18,980,000, from which, according to F. Löher, 325,000,000 slaves and colored people are to be deducted, so that the number of whites was 15,73,000,000. Accordingly, the third part of the white inhabitants of the United States consisted of Germans. Löher considers this figure to be too high; according to his calculations, which are made with great knowledge of the circumstances, the number of Germans in 1846 fluctuated between ½ and ¼ of the total white population. in this compilation, only those inhabitants who still used the German language in 1846 are counted as Germans. Now, around this time, the same states which in the last few decades had absorbed the majority of German immigration were equally attracted to German emigration; already in 1846 the German inhabitants in some of these states amounted to 40% of the local population The following figures, which we borrow from Löher's data, are of particular interest for the assessment of the predominance of the German element in individual states.*) (To be continued.) The scientific determination of the gold discovery sites in German South West Africa. At the geologists' conference held in Greifswald on August 13, 1889, Dr. Gürich, who had been active for the gold syndicate in Southwest Africa, spoke about the gold The German emigration from 1881 to 1888, which amounted to around 1½ million, will have turned to the same states in approximately the same proportion. Roscher, and before him Wappäus, criticized Löher's figures as somewhat too high, and Roscher also assumes that Löyer is too optimistic in his assessment of the continued existence of Germanism; however, it must be conceded that the internal reasons that Löher gives for his view cannot really be countered with a justified objection, just as Löder himself acknowledged that the German people are in constant need of an influx from the homeland. It deserves the highest admiration how patriotically Löher anticipated the rise of our nation. See F. Löher, Geschichte und Zustände der Deutschen in Amerika. Leipzig 1847.

deposits. As only a short newspaper report on this speech was published at the time, we believe that the reprint of the speech from the recently published 3rd issue of the Zeitschrift der Deuischen geologischen Gesellschaft will still be of interest. After an introduction on the history of gold discoveries, the individual deposits were enumerated. "The "Ussab Geld Mine" is located on a rocky hollow on the right bank of the Schwachaub, about 50 km northeast of Walsischbai; the predominant rock is a common biotite gneiss with a steep, easterly dip. At the top, it contains a deposit of garnet rock and a deposit of crystalline limestone. On the western slope of the height, green stripes, probably in the same zone but not exactly in the same horizon of the gneiss, are repeated several times in a northerly direction. These are several, up to 100 m long deposits of chalcopyrite and colored copper ore, mostly very thin, barely 1 em thick. At the output end, the gravels are decomposed and cause the extensive green copper tarnish that makes the deposit appear more important than it really is. In one of these deposits, visible gold was found in small flickers in malachite and siliceous copper in a somewhat quartz-rich part of the gneiss. Despite the mining work carried out, it was not even possible to detect traces of gold in the designated rock by analysis. Apparently, the entire stock of visible gold had been completely cleared away by the shallow digging work of the finders. Very similar conditions exist in a second "gold mine" visited by the speaker on the upper Aib, on the north-western slope of the Couos Mountains. Here, several hand specimens with visible gold were found during some shallow diggings; finely distributed gold was not contained in the rock. The occurrence of gold at the "Pot Mine on an island in the Schwachaubbette, 35 km below Otyimbingne, is of a somewhat different nature. Gold was first found here and these discoveries were the reason for the whole gold movement and for the imperial decree: the gold law for South West Africa. The prevailing horendlende gneiss, which is similar to spenite in layers and contains a lot of titanite, is intercalated with a garnet rock deposit that strikes in the same direction and dips just as steeply as the spenite. At the surface in the middle of its length it is 4m thick. Its boundary towards the slope end is irregular; these irregularities are filled in by fairly large-grained epidote rock, which also occurs in the garnet ice itself, even in turkeys. In this approximately 100 m long garnet ice camp, especially on the border between garnet and epidote rock, there are 4 "copper spots", i.e. the rock there is strongly decomposed and intensely green in color, a thin lime tuff crust covers the angular rock fragments to a depth of several feet. Of the 4 copper nests, however, only one proved to be gold-bearing. In this decomposed rock, which consists of garnet, epidote, abundant magnetic iron, malachite, siliceous copper, leather-brown copper ore and gray iron, the gold is found in irregular flickers in front of olivine, which, according to an initial investigation of minimal rock samples carried out in Germany, is supposed to form the main component of the rock. At the above-mentioned location, the gold has only been found as far down as the decomposition of the rock and the infiltrated cold tuff reached; at a depth of 2 m, not even chemically detectable gold has been found in the rock itself. The garnet deposit was found 23 feet below the surface of the hill through a tunnel from the bedrock; it is thinner here than on the surface, probably contains chalcopyrite in a very limited zone, but no trace of gold. There are several similar garnet rock deposits in the vicinity of the Pot Mine; a lot of work was done in one that contained traces of copper; gold could never be detected, only once was a single grain found, intergrown with brown iron, epidote and garnet. Copper luster, molybdenum luster and abundant coarse scheelite were found in the same rock, which, according to an analysis kindly carried out by H. Traube, is characterized by its molybdenum content. With the eagerness with which gold prospecting was pursued on all sides, new gold finds were soon made, almost all of which the speaker was able to inspect. In the area from Niquib on the lower Kulsib to Noidesten up to the watershed after the Schwachaub, numerous quartz cracks were examined, some of which were indicated as containing gold. They are all small veins of a maximum length of 100 m and thickness of m, which lie in the strike of the gneiss layers and deviate little in the dip - allo striking veins; sedr däusig, however, the same vein coincides for a certain distance with the surrounding layers, thus represents a bearing vein; towards the wedging ends, the veins also deviate in the strike, so that they become speckled veins. Such veins are most numerous and most crowded in the Ussis, a plateau in the middle between the middle Kuisib and the Schwachaub, near a granite massif; here the mica schist-like gneisses are obviously more compressed, and in addition to the aforementioned veins, there are also real, cross-cutting veins. In most of these veins, solid bismuth was found in small, shiny, shining, flaky parts, very abundant wolframite and extremely fine, but rather regularly wedged, gold. It is very rare and difficult to see with the naked eye; it occurs here in very minimally thin flakes. The gold content of these veins is too insignificant to make them appear worth mining. Further finds were made in the Chuos Mountains between the Kan and Schwachaud rivers, halfway between Pot Mine and Walsischbat. The Chuos Mountains form two parallel chains, one of which consists of crystalline limestone, the other of scapolite gneiss containing cascite, epidote and pyroxene. The strike is uniform, with only occasional insignificant twists and folds. On the south-eastern slope of this mountain there are now a whole number of smaller and individual larger quartz sections, lenses, strikes and some cross-cutting veins. These mostly showed a very unevenly wedged content of copper luster; in the superficial parts, as far as the decomposition reaches downwards, beautiful gold visible to the unaided eye has precipitated several times; otherwise the gold is bound to the copper luster, but is again very unevenly distributed in it. Further north, in the inhospitable mountains between Usakos and Karibib, gold has been found in a very unevenly distributed state in several lenticular gravel deposits in the crystalline limestone. The reef-like deposits of the same, which can be traced for miles around, were the reason for the information about such extensive "gold cracks". In the white, beautiful crystalline limestone with tremolite and scapolite, there are equally striking and dipping, slightly thick deposits of decomposed, more dolomitic components with brown iron and sometimes malachite; gold has now been found in this brown rock and very little in the neighboring white marble. In the only limestone that had been examined more closely up to that point, this content ceased again at a depth of 2-3 meters. The finds made at Rehodot seem to be most consistent with those at the Chuos Mountains. Based on previous experience, the gold deposits in German Southwest Africa can therefore be grouped as follows. I. Bismuth type. Gold with bismuth in mainly striking quartz veins. 1st type Ussis. II. copper type. 2nd type Ussab: gold in the outcrop of copper sulphide intercalations in gneiss 3rd type Pot Mine: gold in the outcrop of copper sulphide intercalations in garnet rock. 4th type Usakos: Gold in decomposed copper and iron sulphide deposits in granular limestone. 5th type Chuos Mountains: Gold in quartz sections and veins with copper luster. The copper type is unpleasantly noticeable in that the gold is usually concentrated directly on the surface, or is only present there at all. It is inconceivable that the gold in the output is solely due to the decomposition of the surrounding sulphides, otherwise the gold would also have to be detectable in equal quantities in the undecomposed gravels, which is not the case. Rather, the gold content must have undergone an unconditional enrichment at the earth's surface, naturally only through an external supply. It is probably easiest to assume that the influx occurs evenly with the progressive erosion and decomposition of the uppermost layers, always penetrating further downwards. The bismuth veins are at least somewhat more reliable, but even in these the gold content is far too low to hope for profitable mining in a country where there are such significant technical difficulties to mining. If, therefore, no favorable prospects at all can be attributed to gold mining in our protectorate, the author expressly limits his negative judgment to the area he visited. Correspondence. Gritish misrule in July. Thanks to your kindness, I was granted the opportunity last year to express my opinion on the above subject in your issue of August 17; and the recent publication of a Blue Book containing "Further Correspondence on the Conditions in Zululand" encourages me to take the liberty, with your kind permission, to return to this subject and to refer specifically to a reference made in the said Blue Book to an English government official there by the Chief Secretary of State for Colonial Affairs (Lord Knutsford). The "correspondence" in question relates almost exclusively to the banishment to Saint Helena imposed on Dinizulu (head of the Zulu nation) and the two other unfortunate chiefs. You already know about the unjust handling of the interrogation and the severity of the sentence imposed. One of the most remarkable of the published letters is from Lord Knutsford to the Governor, Sir Charles Mitchell, in which the former expresses himself as follows (the letter is dated December 20, 1889): He states that, after careful consideration of all the circumstances relating to the flogging of certain natives by order of Mr. R. H. Addison (Assistant Government Commissioner and Resident Magistrate at Nowandwa), he "cannot but censure the conduct of the said officer." As the details of this violent assault have escaped general notice, I take the liberty of repeating them in passing. Dinizulu is said to have organized a hunting party, which was attended by a number of invited guests, including Mr. Addison himself; but in consequence of the threatening appearance of the official Unbepu, it was deemed advisable to refrain from the hunt; and Mr. Addison, on his arrival, ordered the party to disperse. I report the subsequent events in the words of the sworn statements taken on record during the interrogation of the chiefs: "The said order was obeyed, and the witnesses, with two other "head-ring" men (half of whom wore headdresses as a sign of rank), and accompanied by 10-15 young people, were on their way home when they were stopped by the police, with

Page 83

The magistrates ordered them to follow the order to the magistrate's office; one of the indentured men, who fell ill and collapsed on the way there, was brutally mistreated by the officials. On arrival at the magistrate's office, all their weapons were taken from them and, without further negotiation, the magistrate ordered a police officer to dol the "nine-tailed kaye" and to give three of the older men ten lashes each. "We were thrown to the ground," one of the witnesses testified, "and I was forcibly held down by my arms and legs." . . . . . . A fourth elderly man was only spared "because he was so emaciated that he would not have survived". Finally, the magistrate gave the command: "Tshyaani abatagaté!" ("Beat the dogs away!"), whereupon they were sent away with sticks and stones. First of all, I now note that the whipping of these men was not only an act of arbitrary cruelty, but a downright transgression of the Natalian decree, according to which the whipping punishment is declared unlawful if the relevant judgment has not first been confirmed by the supreme authority. But in spite of this deplorable act of rashness and utterly inexcusable disregard of all lawful procedure, Mr. Addison is nevertheless left in his important post. It is really to be wondered at that not one of those Members of Parliament who have so specially set themselves up as champions of the welfare of aboriginal races in the Houso of Commons should have seen fit to take a step in a matter which so essentially questions the just and humane treatment of a tribe whose interests they profess to have at heart. I will not go into the general state of affairs in Zululand here, except to say that, in my opinion, the true history of the deplorable English misrule in that country will not be fully and clearly laid before the public until a special commission has been appointed for the purpose of inquiring into the whole administration of the former Governor, Sir A. Havelock and his subordinate officials in Zululand, not only with regard to his treatment of the exiled chiefs, but also with regard to the territorial regulations he has effected, which are the latest stage in a policy of injustice and oppression which has now been pursued for so long. Miss Colenso (daughter of the Bishop of Natal, the defender of Ketschwavo), whose noble efforts in favor of these chiefs I mentioned in my communication of last year, recently arrived in London from Zululand, with the intention of exerting pressure on the government and public opinion here, and in this way to bring about a reduction or revision of the heavy sentence passed on Dinizulu and his fellow-sufferers. Unfortunately, a conversation she had with Lord Kuntsford at the Colonial Ministry did not lead to any encouraging results, as the Colonial Secretary made it quite clear to her that he was determined to uphold his decision regarding the chiefs he had banished. It remains to be seen what prospect there is that the appeals made by her and others to the British public and Parliament in the name of justice will be successful. London, March 21, 1890, Charles Haneock, Barrister-at-law. P. 8. I refrain from touching on the history preceding the Zululand troubles. These events are to be found in various parts of the "Deutsche Kolonialzeitung" in the last two or three volumes; moreover, they are compiled in a brief and impartial manner by Mr. Klössel in his recently published work ("Die Südafrikanischen Republiken"), which is also well known in England. The Australian Confederation. Of all the British possessions, none - not even India - has experienced such a great upswing in recent decades as Australia. Almost unknown 100 years ago, it was initially used only as a criminal colony. The beginning of its brilliant development dates from the mid-fifties, when the rich gold discoveries in Victoria attracted thousands of adventurers from all parts of the world to these parts. But even when the gold mines were more or less exhausted, most of the immigrants remained in the country that had become their second home. Early on, individual states were formed in Australia, of which New South Wales and Victoria were the most important. With the growing prosperity, a mutual jealousy gradually emerged, which soon gave rise to domestic friction. Instead of working together, they separated themselves from each other through strict protective tariffs. The peculiarity of political conditions in Australia will be better understood if we take a brief look at the system of third colonial administration. England does not administer its possessions according to a uniform scheme, but takes due account of the different customs and traditions of its subjects, who are scattered all over the world. The degree of political freedom is also measured according to race and education. Countries with a predominantly native or African (black) population are subordinate to the Crown. The inhabitants are treated mildly and kindly, but are not granted any political rights. This includes most of the West Indian possessions apart from the West Indies. - Those colonies, on the other hand, whose inhabitants are largely made up of immigrant Europeans or their descendants, enjoy far greater rights. England, instructed by the apostasy of the United States in the 18th century, has granted them freedoms which have greatly loosened their ties with the mother country. They have their own parliaments, taxing powers and self-government. Only the highest official (viceroy, governor) is appointed by the Queen. These favored possessions include first and foremost Australia and Canada. It is easy to explain why, under such conditions, the sense of independence of the white population had to grow enormously with the increasing prosperity of their country. They repeatedly and openly discussed separation from the mother country in their newspapers. On the Thames, too, it was recognized that something had to be done to reaffirm the loosened relationship between the colonies and the mother country. The great colonial exhibition which took place a few years ago, and to which representatives from all the British possessions were sent, gave the first impetus to the still much-discussed "Imperial Federation "*) A few words about this project may seem appropriate here. Without restricting the internal freedom of the individual states, the Imperial Federation aims to establish a closer connection between the third colonies and the mother country. Apart from the establishment of an imperial parliament, it is primarily calculated to provide mutual support in times of war. Whereas England had hitherto been solely responsible for the expenditure of the army and navy, from now on a common lord and a common navy were to be created. The plan, which was said to be the brainchild of none other than the Prince of Wales, was initially greeted with great acclaim. But it did not stand up to sober criticism. After all, how could an agreement be reached between peoples who were so far apart in terms of religion, ancestry and customs? As a rule, the political interests of one country are too far removed from those of the other. One example may prove this. In Australia, Chinese immigration had grown to such an alarming extent in recent decades that it was decided to take coercive measures against it. The Chinese envoy in London, Marquis Tseng, therefore lodged a complaint with the British government. The Cabinet of St. James was in no small embarrassment. On the one hand, it did not want to offend China for reasons of politics and trade, and on the other, it did not want to offend the Australian colonies, which were impetuously demanding approval of the law. It was only with great difficulty that an agreement satisfactory to both parties was finally reached. This incident, to which we could add many more similar ones, will suffice to show the difficulties with which the realization of the Imperial Federation would have to struggle. On the other hand, the project envisaged by the Australians at a congress held in Meldourne in February of this year, which was attended by delegates from all the states, appears to be quite different. We are referring to the new Australian League of Nations. The obstacles which had to be overcome to bring about a union of all the States were not small. Each state had closed itself off from the others by strict tariff barriers to protect its own industry and trade. The tariff reform, on which no agreement could be reached, therefore threatened to thwart the unification of Australia right from the start. But the Assembly had not reckoned with the youthful enthusiasm of the 75-year-old Premier of New South Wales, Sir Heury Parkes. He eloquently pointed out that such a favorable moment for the unification of all Australia might never come again. He threatened Chinese immigration, enticed with the prospect of dominion over the South Seas, painted a picture of the attractive life at the Governor-General's future court in Australia, and finally overruled his initial opponents, Dunkan Gillies, Prime Minister of Victoria, and Captain Russel, Colonial Secretary of New Zealand. The unification of all the states was thus accepted in principle. The following resolutions were passed for its realization: 1. the members of the conference will take the necessary measures to induce the legislative bodies of their respective colonies to send deputies to an Australian national assembly in the course of the year, who are authorized to examine the plan of a federal constitution and to draw up a report on this subject. (2) This National Assembly shall consist of seven deputies for each independent and four deputies for each Crown Colony. In order not to give preference to any city, Albury on the Murra River was chosen as the capital of the new confederation. Albury on the Murra River was chosen. This was based on the same principles as in the United States of North America (Wahington) and Canada (Ottawa). In order to deprive the movement of the appearance of any demonstration directed against England, it was unanimously decided to send an address to the Queen. The latter had the following wording: "We, the faithful and respectful subjects of Her Majesty, members of a Consistory assembled at Meldourne to consider the question of organizing an Australian federal constitution, desire to renew the expression of our affection for Her Majesty's throne and person. In the name of all the Australian subjects of Your Majesty, we desire to express the ardent wish that Your Majesty may long continue to reign over a happy people. What is particularly striking about the last document is that the address was not sent through the intermediary of the Third Colonial Minister, but directly *) Bergl. James Froude, Tbe English in the West Indies. London 1888 and "Die Jmperial Federation" by Prof. v. Philippovich, D. Kol.=Zig. 1888, No. 36.

is addressed to the queen. The presence of the former is therefore deliberately ignored. The consequences of the new movement can already be seen with a fair degree of certainty. Sooner or later it will lead to a complete separation from the Mukterland. The older generation, headed by Henry Parkes and Dunkan Gillies, are still trying to maintain the connection with England for the time being. But when the younger generation takes the helm - and that time is not far off - then the cry will also resound: "Australia to the Australians!" All English measures, whether friendly or hostile, will not be able to change the realization of the plan. It also appears that this view has already been reached on the Thames. By acquiring a huge empire in Africa, they are trying to compensate themselves for the loss of Australia. Hans Altona. The French Andan. The policy which the French have pursued in Senegal with regard to their further advance in the Sudan will, it is said, enter a new phase. We learn the following from the "Temps", which has always been well informed when it comes to matters of government: A commission presided over by the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, Etienne, has proposed a series of measures aimed, on the one hand, at reducing the costs of the occupation of the French Sudan and, on the other, at reorganizing this region on new foundations and taking advantage of the experience acquired in recent years. Since the Under-Secretary of State has approved the reforms proposed by the Commission, it is now possible to announce the modifications that will come into force this year. The French Sudan will be placed under the authority of a higher commander residing in Basoulabé; it will be independent in military and administrative terms, but dependent on the Senegalese governor in terms of policy. (This will be followed by orders concerning the distribution, recruitment. Oraanization rc. of the military forces. As far as the iron baths are concerned, the Commission requests that the construction of the same beyond Basonlabé be definitively abandoned and that a 60-meter Decauville railroad be built instead of the current 1-meter gauge, as soon as the current railroad is no longer able to provide service, which will not be long, since both the railroad itself and the rolling stock have been used up. Among the documents submitted to the Commission, we believe we must mention the memorandum of Lieutenant-Colonel Gallieni, who, thanks to his campaigns and his missions, knows the country admirably. In the "Estafette" we find the following excerpt from this memorandum: "Our situation in Sudan is still a miserable one. We have made great efforts to wrest from the rule of the great Negro chiefs a certain number of small states, whose population represents 200,000 inhabitants, and have placed three large states with a million inhabitants under our nominal protectorate, but the Sultan Abmadon, who lives in Nioro, Samory, which is situated on the right bank of the Niger and separates us from the countries recently placed under our protectorate by Captain Binger, to the south and west the almamps of Foutab=Djallon, which cut off our connection with our branches of the Riviäres du Sud, are decidedly hostile to us From the commercial point of view, Medine has seen its trade with the Ahmadou states increase; some negotiators have settled in Bafoulabé. These results, however, are insufficient in relation to the efforts made, and it is necessary, in order to extend our trade, to prevent the great chiefs from interrupting our relations with the peoples directly subject to us, to block our trade routes towards the sea, the middle and lower Niger, and finally to prevent the caravans crossing the French Sudan from being put into contribution by the great chiefs. To this end it is necessary without hesitation to accept the Trukouleur inheritance and to seize Nioros in particular, which will allow us to get in touch with the Moorish caravans coming northwards from Algeria. This is the only way we can establish contact with Algeria. Niero was the final destination of the Lenz coming from Morocco. Nioro is the key to the French Sudan in the north. As long as we do not deploy it, there will be no secure trade with the regions north of the Se Negal and the Riger. It would also be good to secure Timbo in order to be able to monitor the Fontah-Djallon effectively. But we must not limit our efforts to this alone. We will not achieve any practical result if we have not opened up to the sea the trade routes that are absolutely necessary for our exports and imports. Merchants must be given access to the Niger route on the one hand and the rivers that flow into the Gulf of Guinea on the other for their shipments. All our efforts within the Basoulabé-Segon-Sequiri triangle will be fruitless if we do not leave it. We must hurry! The English are already on the lower Niger via Sokolo. They could be in Timbuctu before two years have passed. On the other hand, the Germans are advancing from the Gulf of Guinea towards the Kuie of the Niger and have already approached the borders of the Macina. On the day when our rivals have laid hands on Timbuctu, the Macina and Moshi, we can only tie up our bundle and abandon our enterprise on the Oder River.
It is therefore important that, at the very beginning of the next campaign, our two gunboats should emphasize a diplomatic mission charged with placing Macina, which has a population of one million, and Timbuctu, which with Nioro would secure us a monopoly of trade with the Moors of the Sahara, under our protectorate. At the same time, another mission would have to pursue the work of Captain Binger and open up our trade routes to the sea through the Alda and other watercourses flowing into the Gulf of Guinea in the direction of Grand Bassam and our other possessions in the Gulf. On the question of the use of Chinese in the German colonies. West Oakland, Cal., February 26, 1890. The article on Chinese workers for New Guinea in number ! of the "Deutsche Kolonial=Ztg." was very interesting to me, as I have had the opportunity to observe the Chinese immigrants in California for twenty years. For ten years I lived almost continuously in San Francisco, where a large part of the city is inhabited exclusively by Chinese. Since I think everything the writer has said in the article in question is correct, I will take the liberty of adding a few brief remarks. It has always been generally believed here that the largest railroad in North America, the Central Pacisie Rail Road, could not have been built until now if it had not been for the help of Chinese workers. It was the tireless Chinese hordes who, with shovels and hoes, cleared the way through mountains and valleys under the direction of the whites. They were satisfied with the simplest of rations and low wages and were submissive to orders. As to the Chinese character, I would add that it has been recognized here that the Chinese are well suited for the lower half of the work because of their untiring diligence and that they take it with the least consideration. Otherwise they have few virtues and are not pleasant neighbors. They have also helped a great deal in irrigating large tracts of land in southern California. Where sixteen years ago I saw only steppes, where at most sheep could graze meagerly, today there are large fields of wheat and many large orchards and vineyards. This is how the flourishing towns of Santa Ana, Pasadena and Anaheim came into being, the last of which was founded exclusively by Germans. These towns are located not far from the Pacific Ocean and between it and the city of Los Angeles. Irrigation is partly by artesian wells powered by windmills or by steam, but mostly by a small river, the Santa Ana River, which can be crossed by horse and cart in summer. We Germans who live abroad are convinced that Germany needs colonies, not only for its overflowing population, but also for its trade. We have done much for the world through our research and science and should now take advantage of the distribution of the earth and use the experience of other nations to acquire and establish our own German colonies. This will also be a blessing for those overseas countries, for where Germany rules, even the poorest will have their rights. Every German should support the Imperial Government in this matter and remember that it was the colonies that made the English so rich. Eduard Selzer. The relations of Hurinam. Paramaribo, Surinam. If a 40-year stay in a tropical colony entitles someone to publish his accumulated experience of the conditions of the colony in which he lives in a completely impartial manner, then the undersigned, who has lived in the colony of Surinam for 40 years, believes he is entitled to do so and to make the following statement to the public. The disadvantages of the colony with regard to immigration lie, according to the political direction, in the fact that the electorate for the representation of the people extends only to the wealthy class of citizens, that the lower classes of the people are not in a position to protect their interests through representatives elected by them and to be able to put forward their wishes. The judicial system is also in urgent need of reform, as well as the establishment of agricultural credit institutions to meet the general need for land duration and planters, the creation of suitable communication routes to connect the districts with the capital Paramarido, and finally the promotion of immigration on the broadest possible basis with easy acquisition of public lands. If the Dutch governorate were to decide to take appropriate steps and communicate with other nations in order to make the flow of European emigrants accessible to its colony, the present time would offer the best opportunity to do so, because a shift in the emigration movement is taking place right now, the consequences of which could be of the greatest importance for Surinam. The reason for this shift is probably due to the aggravating measures that the government of the United States imposes on the immigration of foreign emigrants, which may cause some European emigrants to settle elsewhere than in North America. As far as the climate in Surinam is concerned, tropical diseases such as yellow fever, cholera, etc. never occur here. Only at the change of season, the transition from the rainy to the dry season and vice versa, in the months of September and April, do attacks of plague occur, but these are rarely of a dangerous nature. The heat, which can be assumed to average between 20 and 25' Reaumur, is significantly cooled by the sea breeze and is quite bearable. - Natural phenomena such as earthquakes, flooding, etc. do not occur. The soil is so extraordinarily fertile that fertilization is completely unnecessary. Crops such as batatas, manioc (cassava), yams, ginger, peanuts and other varieties grow so abundantly that some of them produce two harvests.

per year. - The brod tree, papaya and banana provide plenty of healthy food and their cultivation requires little effort and labor. Vegetables such as cabbage, peas and beans, lettuce, parsley, celery, tomatoes, pumpkins, melons and others thrive excellently here. Livestock farming can also be practiced with benefit. The forests are home to plenty of game. The only annoying pest is caused by mosquitoes, especially in the low-lying areas, but this plague does not last all year round, but only from time to time, and you can protect yourself against it in many ways. Only those people would be advised to move to Surinam who are able to live on their own expenses during the first year of their stay here, which are, however, only small in this splendid climate, where nature comes to our aid in such abundance. For Schreider personally, the immigration of Europeans is of no further interest. His only purpose in writing this report is to draw the attention of people who wish to emigrate to the great advantages that this colony, which is (strangely enough) still so little known in Europe, offers European emigrants, both in terms of its wonderful climate and its fertile soil. Cesar Busch. News from the Society. The meeting of the Board of Directors on March 22, 1890, in the large hall of the Imperial Court, was opened by His Serene Highness the Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg with a speech in which he looked at the general political situation and expressed the hope that the colonial idea would prevail despite the many difficulties to be expected. After the report for the year 1889 had been presented, Mr. Arnhold, on behalf of the committee, explained the estimate for the year 1890, which closed with 100,561 marks in income and 79,660 marks in expenditure. A number of amendments were proposed to this estimate with the aim of achieving larger surpluses. After the majority of the items had been discussed in detail, the estimate for 1890, as determined by the committee, was adopted, as it proved to be impracticable, in view of the current scope of business operations, to bring about a greater restriction of expenditure than had already been provided for in the estimate. Discussion then turned to the various motions to amend the Articles of Association. After a lengthy debate, a motion put forward by the committee was adopted in the following version: The Board of Directors shall resolve to propose to the Annual General Meeting: 1. Section V (1) of the Articles of Association shall be amended so that the number of members of the Board of Directors to be elected at the Annual General Meeting is increased from 25 to 50 and the Board of Directors may increase the number of its members elected at the Annual General Meeting by up to 100. (For the two numbers 25 and 50, 50 and 100 respectively should therefore be set, otherwise the article remains unchanged. 2. section IV number 6 shall in future read as follows: "The Divisions and Gauverbände shall be obliged to obtain the consent of the Committee for any public announcement or other measure which may affect the general interests of the Society to be safeguarded by the Board and Committee. In particular, this must be done if departments intend to initiate or promote overseas ventures from Association funds or publicly under the name of the Association. If the committee does not give its approval to such a request within 14 days, the department is entitled, but also obliged before taking further steps, to appeal to the decision of the board. In such a case, a meeting of the Board of Directors must be convened within 14 days at the latest. 3. in section IV, paragraph 7, the following shall be added: "If various departments enter into consultation with each other on association matters of a general nature, the initiating department shall inform the committee of this in good time. 4. in section V, paragraph 5, the following sentence shall be inserted after the word "Board" in the third line: "or by one or more departments which together have at least 1000 members.
A motion by Eberswalde to amend Article 5 in Section IV of the Articles of Association, which was accepted by the Committee, was referred back to the Committee after a lengthy debate. A motion from the Hanover branch concerning Article 5 of the statutes, which deals with the election of the board, was also referred to the committee. A motion by the Dresden Division concerning the use of the annual surplus was rejected after detailed discussion. There were also motions from various departments concerning the safeguarding of the borders of the German spheres of interest in Africa. These were settled by the fact that, at the request of the Committee, it was decided to instruct the Presidium to submit a petition to the Reich Chancellor requesting that the borders of the German spheres of interest in Africa be secured. The agenda for the Annual General Meeting in Cologne, which is scheduled for a date to be determined between June 16 and 21, was then set. The motions Darmstadt, concerning the conversion of the protectorates into crown colonies, Berlin, to send the documents for the Board meeting to the departments at least 3 days before the meeting, were referred (the latter after acceptance in principle) to the Committee for further consideration. After the Chairman had given an overview of the activities of the Presidium and of the funds approved by the Committee for colonial purposes, he closed the meeting at around 11 a.m. Minister v. Wedell thanked the Presidium and the Bureau for their prudent and careful management and handling of the business. - The Society's Committee held a meeting on March 18 under the chairmanship of Minister of State v. Hofmann, at which the proposals to be submitted to the Board of Directors were discussed. The committee also took note of the formation of two new departments: I. Weßlar. 1st Chairman: Mr. Factory Owner Artb. Packard. 2nd Chairman: Mr. Rezierungsrat Bödecker. Secretary: Mr. Kaufmann R. Siegelmann. Treasurer: Mr. Tannery owner Jnl. Michel. II Sondershausen. Chairman: Mr. Oberst z. D. von Kampp. Deputy chairman and secretary: Mr. Regierungsrat Budde. Treasurer: Mr. Court Pharmacist Funke. The committee expressed its gratitude for the special services rendered by the board members in establishing the two departments. Explanation. The "Berliner Tageblatt", against which a private lawsuit was filed due to the aforementioned defamatory article of June 8 of the previous year, has now been prompted in No. 152 of this year's issue to retract the allegations it made at the time in the following statement: No. 285 of the "Berliner Tageblatt" of June 8, 1889, contained an editorial dealing with the German Colonial Society, in which we gave space to a letter we had received about the management of the Society. It has now emerged that the factual information contained in the letter is unfounded; on the contrary, we have satisfied ourselves that the auditing financial commission has found the books to be in order. It goes without saying that when we received the letter we did not intend any offense to the persons entrusted with the management. The "Tageblatt" has also had its representative in court express its regret at the publication of this article and has voluntarily accepted to bear the entire judicial and extrajudicial costs of the proceedings. The dishonest source from which the "Tageblatt" admittedly drew its information is the one we already reported in No. 25 of the previous issue of our newspaper. - In the Berlin section on March 14, Dr. Karl Kaerger spoke about the province of Szo Paulo and the benefits that could be drawn from the actions and progress made there for our German colonies. As is well known, Suo Paulo has achieved an unimagined development through coffee cultivation in the highlands, which determines the entire economic nature of the province of the present state, but has a bad reputation among German immigration because of the parcerie contracts. Redner showed, however, how the notorious half-rent system had gradually been abandoned in Sllo Paulo in favor of a fixed calculation for the coffee produced or a lodge system, which he called an ideal one and consists of the worker being paid for his chopping work and at the same time receiving his share of the harvest, but also a piece of land on which he can grow his own necessary food. In a comparison with the southern provinces, where the colonists do not grow world trade products, Sto Paulo can only win. In Suo Paulo, a large proportion of the Germans who were previously brought over on the infamous half-lease agreements have become wealthy, acquired land and formed communities, so that the German immigrants are no longer in danger of preying on them as they were 30 years ago, especially as the railroad system of the province's Kaffir jones has also developed so well.

is more developed than that of France. As far as the profitability of the cash register is concerned, it is at worst 13-15%, at best over 30% of the capital. When one sees the tremendous upswing that has been brought about by coffee culture, it appears to be of the greatest importance to start in our colonies, where there is sufficiently deep soil and a suitable climate. Another requirement is the construction of railroads and settlement by Europeans, which may be possible in the higher regions of our colonies. Of course, there could be no question of mass emigration, as this would be mass murder, but perhaps a coffee culture company could begin to employ workers according to the Paulistan lodge system, which could be settled in the higher regions of Usambara, for example. During the debate, concerns were repeatedly raised as to whether the climatic conditions would permit such a settlement and whether the German farmers would also comply with the sanitary regulations as necessary to ensure relative safety, but it was basically conceded that if colonization by Europeans were to be undertaken at all in East Africa, the Paulistan system would have many advantages. - On the 21st, under the chairmanship of Professor v. Cuny, Captain (ret.) Immeckenberg gave a lecture on the railroad question in East Africa. We cannot go into details in detail, but only want to give a broad outline of the main points. The railroad facilities are intended to open up East Africa economically in the true sense of the word, to secure the hinterland for us politically and to facilitate service at the military stations. Now that the government has subsidized a steamship line to East Africa, the formation of a railroad company should be started soon, and there is already lively interest in this project from a wider circle. For such a project, the area can be divided into a northern, central and southern part, each of which has its own advantages. The northern area includes the fertile Usambara, where plantation cultivation has begun, and the Kilimanjaro lands, which will be of great importance in the future, while the central area includes the main caravan route to Mpuapua and Tabora, and the southern area would allow access to Lake Nyassa using the Rusiji River. The speaker tried to prove that the Bosna Railway and the Indian Iron Baths could serve as models for the East African railroads in a certain way, since the facilities were intended as narrow-gauge pioneer railroads, and that the Pangani or Tanga=Kilimanjaro, Dar=es=Salaam=Mpuapua-Tabora and Rusiji=Ulanga=Nyassa ronies would have to be built later without excessive costs. The debate focused in particular on the urgency of one or the other facility, the cost estimate, etc., but could not reach a conclusion due to the uncertainty of the factors under consideration. The railroad question for Usambara will be discussed again later in a special presentation by Premierleutnant Weiß. - Hamm Division. On the 13th, an extraordinary general meeting of the local colonial department took place in the Harmonie hall, at which the previous board was re-elected by acclamation. This was followed by a very instructive 1½ hour lecture by Captain v. Hacke on the labor question in the German colonies and his experiences in East Africa (1887-89). The meeting was attended by over 100 people. - After the lecture, a number of members joined together for dinner. - Magdeburg Branch. On February 10, the monthly meeting took place, at which Professor Maenß spoke about colonial literature and the current situation, and a farewell reception was held in honor of the members of the Magdeburg branch traveling to Ostatrila, Mr. Schiele and Mr. Marerander, who will soon establish a station or factory in Tanga, over which the Magdeburg flag will fly alongside the German flag. On March 4, Naval Pastor Wangemann spoke. On the 6th, the detachment held its monthly meeting, at which the secretary gave a report on the status of colonial affairs. Zorge Department. Mr. Albert Glesau from Magdeburg, the founder of our department, once again took the opportunity to visit us as an old friend and acquaintance, as he has done on several occasions. Equipped with a wide range of trade articles from the German colonies, such as koval, pawpaws, scsam, cloves, raw cotton, peanuts, etc. In addition to art products of the natives of German East Africa, a large number of views of Sanstbar, the opposite coast and the interior, maps, magazines and the like, Mr. Giesan gave a lecture here on 6 March on German colonization in general and East Africa in particular, which was attended by a large audience. The speaker discussed the nature, purpose and necessity of German colonization in an easily understandable, clear, often humorous and yet in-depth manner. It cannot be denied that such lectures are the most suitable means of awakening understanding for our colonies and dispelling many prejudices, especially those aroused by the opposing press. Mr. Giesan also gave a well-attended lecture in Benneckenstein on the 7th, which also revived interest in our colonies there. - London Department. Dr. Fick, the first secretary of the department, resigned his office due to delay, which has been taken over by Mr. Tbeodor Trost, former secretary for the internal affairs of the abseiling. Small announcements. (German Somali expedition.) After a German expedition under the leadership of Mr. v. Schoening had set out from Aben for Halule at the end of last year, but had to return to Aden without having achieved anything, the same expedition left Aden again on March 9, this time under the leadership of Mr. Hoffmann, a government architect from Berlin, on a steamer chartered by the Perim Coal Company, in order to establish a German station on the Somali coast. As reported in the local newspapers from Aden, the expedition consists of five Germans and a few colored people who act as interpreters, carpenters, servants and so on. Of the German participants, Mr. Rühle, who has been in the service of the East African Society for a long time and is accompanying the current expedition as a commercial advisor, has sufficient experience in African conditions and speaks the Swahili language. - Understandably, we have not been able to take any notice of these events up to now, but since the daily press, which has often enough drawn the attention of other nations to our undertakings through its sensationalist zeal in colonial matters, is reporting them, the reason for our silence is now gone. We wish the best of success to this enterprise, which has been long in the offing and has not underestimated the difficulties it faces. Times" reports from Sanstbar on March 18 - (From East Africa.) The Sultan, with the consent of the Danish authorities, has sent two plenipotentiaries to establish peace on the mainland between Arabs and Germans in the south of Dar=es=Salaam. Emin Pasha returned to Bagamoyo today. - On March 8 and 9, the Reichskommissar, Major Wißmann, blew up the last troop gathered by Bwana Heri, with the enemy losing 40 dead, while on the German side 1 Euroväer was killed and 5 men of the colored troop were wounded. - Major Liebert returns to Germany the following month after a visit to the German coastline. The rainy season has begun and the weather is most unhealthy. - According to a telegram in the "Times" from Zanzibar, the German expedition sent to Usambara under Schmidt has returned successfully. Zimbodia and Kimweri have paid full compensation for the losses inflicted on Dr. Meyer (from the British East African Company). The Arab slaveholders of the Mombasa district held a meeting on March 17 and unanimously decided to accept the terms agreed by Mr. Mackenzie, the head of the British East African Company, with their runaway slaves. By virtue of this agreement, industrious slaves may obtain their immediate freedom by each of them performing labor to the monetary value of 50 shillings. The number of slaves who will benefit from this provision is estimated at 2000 to 3000 (From South Africa.) The first Lord of the Treasury gave some information about Swaziland in the London House of Commons on March 18. The natives, said Mr. Smith, want to preserve their independence, the Europeans are divided as to whether or not they should advocate an annexation to the Transvaal. By convention of 1887, the establishment of a British protectorate in Swaziland without the consent of the Transvaal Republic is ruled out. With regard to the annexation of Swaziland to the latter, the settlers of English nationality are also of different opinions for the reason that some are reluctant to subordinate themselves to the existing Boer government in Transvaal, while others hope that by uniting Swaziland with Transvaal the Anglicization of this commonwealth would receive a significant boost. - The "Kimberley Advertiser" is informed from Johannesburg that it is confirmed that the Boers are equipping a regular expedition from Zoutpansburg to Manvai, the southern part of Mashonaland. The train is to consist of 1500 men and will leave at the beginning of winter. - According to a telegram from the Reuters office in Cape Town, the President of the South African Republic, Kruger, has publicly given his approval for the construction of a direct railroad between Bloemfontein and Johannesburg. The Cape Government is currently building a line connecting Bloemfontein with its own railroad and extending to Johannesburg. (This will create a rail link between Johannesburg and the sea. (From Cameroon.) According to the latest news from Cameroon, Lieutenant Morgen (Erpedition Kund) completed his first journey into the hinterland of the southern Cameroon region in mid-January. The journey is noteworthy not only because it was completed from Batanga to Jaundestation and back in two months, but also because Lieutenant Morgen managed to take a different route from the well-known Jaundestation to the coast, namely down the Sanaga River. Lieutenant Morgen thus stabbed the most stubborn defenders of the intermediate trade, the Duallabe people, in the back, who at that time were fighting a serious battle with the merchants in Malimba and would not allow them to travel up the Sanaga River. Lieutenant Morgen fought a battle with the Malimba army, from which they had to retreat with heavy losses. It is now hoped in Cameroon that the power of the middlemen in Malimba will be broken and that it will be possible to open up the lower Sanaga to trade. This vigorous intervention by the Dene government deserves all recognition, for according to the latest reports from the Cameroon hinterland, there can be no doubt that trade is capable of a great upswing once the Dualla middlemen have been completely eliminated. - A detailed report has now arrived from Dr. Zintgraff about his journey to Adamaua last year, which substantially supplements his earlier brief report in some respects. His caravan consisted, as the "Mitteilungen aus den deutschen Schuz gebieten" report, of 180 men, namely 80 white and 100 rank and file from Lagos.) The latter were praised for their supposedly particularly brave and warlike qualities, which later proved to be deceptive. The traveler was received with hostility and hostility by the Banyangs. However, they made their way through almost without loss and in mid-January 1888 reached the long-sought grassy plain from the mountainous country.

Page 87

The expedition then reached Bali, where a station was built and a three-month stay was taken, not entirely voluntarily. The traveler writes about the station: "In two months it was built mainly by the natives themselves and, together with the white man's house with four rooms, has 30 buildings. It deserves to be mentioned that not a single one, neither chief nor sub-chief nor the least man, asked for gifts or payment for the services rendered. On the onward march they again had to contend with the hostility of the Indians who were leading the caravan astray. By forced marches they escaped a planned ambush. Among the Bufa, where both sexes appear fully naked, while among the Bali only the women are completely naked, the expedition was warmly welcomed by the chief Bufangu. From then on, the train traveled for three days through inhospitable regions, where there were no paths or footbridges, but in places horrible climbs over rocks and steep slopes. On the fourth day we saw a small village in the distance of a completely different type of construction, according to the Haussa=Dolmeischer a so-called "Ringi", which is a pre= or planting village that always belongs to the larger villages in Adamaua. The houses were built in the same way here as on the Benne - round with a round pointed roof. A man who spoke the local language, an emissary of the chief of Mudi, appeared at the other tige." We were safe, Dr. Zintgraff continues, even though the food was very scarce for so many people. I was held back in this miserable plantation village for ten days until the excitement over the unusual arrival of a white man from this side with many rifles had subsided and permission to come had been obtained from the chief of Takum, who was three days' journey to the north. But on the way, the otherwise very polite and modest natives, who were already walking in long house robes, courts and turdans, as well as with long swords and spears, did not allow us into their villages, and only in Takum itself, a very large village, did the chief allow us to enter, of course only to let us set up camp outside the city walls - in these areas all villages have mud walls. Here in Takum I also hear that there are supposed to be Europeans two days' journey further on. A number of empty gin bottles and an empty cognac bottle, with which the people had decorated their pointed round roofs like the tops of towers, proved that they could not actually be there. After a five-day stay, we went to Donga, where there was a factory of the Reyal Niger Company that was currently empty. Here, on May 28, 1889, the end of Flegel's travels took place. From Donga we went to Okari (Wukari to Flegel) and another day's journey lay between us and a European settlement. I was sitting in my house in the afternoon with my last handful of flour when three natives came into the room with two large boxes of provisions and carried a very friendly letter from the Niger Company's first representative on the Benue, Mr. Nr Jnt so, which bore the inscription: "To the Kuropean, said to do a Donga. along nith sew provisions." Two days later, the expedition reached Jbi, where the leader and all the crew were warmly welcomed at the Royal Niger Company's factories. After a four-day stay, the return journey began. It was not without its dangers, in particular 24 men were lost between Bamungu and Babui when crossing the 2000 meter high mountain range due to cold, hail and wind. After repairing the buildings, 7 men were left behind at the Bali station and the train reached Cameroon again on January 5. (Conditions in Dahomey) Lo Stöclo published the following information sent to him by a merchant and former consul who was thoroughly familiar with the conditions in Dahomey: "The standing masters (men) number just over 1200 men; the Amazons, a parade corps, number J. to 400 heads. On expeditions, however, the king draws in the whole world, but it is doubtful whether he can bring together more than 3 to 4000 men. They are not very formidable warriors, these Dahomeyers! Since the king does not arm or feed his army, each soldier must bring his own food, weapons and ammunition. As firearms they have only flintlock rifles, for ammunition only a poor quality foreign powder acquired in exchange; their supply of powder, which they cannot renew immediately, is soon exhausted. As fighters they are not very formidable, as they never attack sharply; they are not an army, they are bands without cohesion and without means. Abomey is a very large town, although it barely has 12,000 inhabitants, it is open and is not disfigured by any work. The houses are made of bamboo or rammed earth. The king alone owns a house with one storey, but it is not yet inhabited. The king's palace, also built of rammed earth, lies at the back of a beautiful square, around which the sheds housing the standing troops rise. In the middle of this square, you can still see the old guns without their mounts, which were given to the King of Dahomey by France. If Abomey is suddenly taken, it can be assumed that several million ounces of gold will be found in the king's palace. (In his reply (page 61, No. 5) to the correspondence from Brussels (page 25, No. 2 of the Col.=Zig.), Mr. D. Grundemann expressed the opinion that what had been said in the correspondence about the treatment of the Australians was based on a generalization of individual incidents, which would be a gross falsehood. We take the liberty of citing the following as new and, in our opinion, unsuspicious evidence that this treatment of the indigenous people is generalized in certain districts. In the Bullotin de la Société Royale de diéographio d'Anvers (14th volume, l. issue, 1890) there is an account of a speech given by Mrs. Couvreur on "Le Queonsland et l'Australie" at the Antwerp Geographical Society. She had visited the grazing grounds in Queonsland, where her brother was engaged in large-scale cattle breeding, and gives her experience of the relationship between the "squatters" and the natives as follows: "I asked a squatter one day, "What do you do when these natives kill your cattle?". He replied with a smile: "We arm our native police, we pursue the savages, and we have very good means of dispersing them!" It was only later that I learned the meaning the squatter gave to the word "disperse", namely by pursuing, shooting and killing these unfortunate blacks. There are many things that would not happen if the authorities knew about them! - The Frankfurter Zeitung of March 10 also contained correspondence from Sydney dated January 14, the main details of which we reproduce below: In the last few days, German sources have revealed horrifying details about the treatment of the South Australian natives by the English colonists, especially the police there. On June 9, a public meeting was held in Adelaide at which the situation of the natives was discussed. Among the speakers was a missionary from the German mission station on the Finke River, Pastor Schwarz. He reported on his own experiences as follows: A few months ago, a black man who was generally feared for his savagery arrived at the mission station and immediately began to get up to all kinds of mischief. Amicable talks did not help, and finally the missionaries had no choice but to send for a policeman and ask him to put the troublemaker in jail. The officer appeared, accompanied by three other constables. But instead of pursuing the miscreant, who had meanwhile escaped into the thicket, the gentlemen made things easy for themselves. Without further ado, they picked up three blacks in the bush who had done absolutely nothing wrong and left with them, who they also locked together in chains, without paying the slightest attention to the objections of the missionaries, who were furious about this unjustified procedure. A few days later, the unfortunate men were found dead in the forest. The policemen had simply shot them dead to save themselves the long journey to Port Augusta. The chains were still attached to the bodies. The matter was reported to the Ministry in Adelaide at the time, but they were told that nothing could be done because the policemen denied having shot the blacks. However, one of these clean officers later boldly told Pastor Schwargz that if he, Schwarz, had done as the blacks did, he too would have been shot down. As far as the treatment of the natives on the so-called stations in the interior was concerned, the pastor explained that young boys were generally not treated badly because they could be used for work, but the treatment of the men, who were mistreated in the most brutal manner, was all the more despicable. In fact, both the boys and the men are slaves of the rich squatters, as are the many young girls who are not missing from any of the "stations". They are treated very well, at least much better than their male tribesmen, but in moral terms their lot is all the sadder. Schwartz knows of individual stations where no fewer than ten to fifteen girls are kept at any one time, in other words formal harems. Some of these young creatures are called Mrs. So and Mrs. So, depending on the name of the big man with whom they live. Pastor Schwartz openly admits that the girls mostly consent to this life of their own free will, precisely because they are treated well and given beautiful clothes. Those who are reluctant, of course, fare all the worse. Pastor Schwartz then tells of another policeman who was also supposed to arrest a couple of blacks, but found it far easier to shoot his two arrestees over the head - it seems to be an everyday occurrence. The procedure here is as simple as can be. The policeman, who is too far away and wants to get rid of the inconvenient detainees, deliberately gives the unfortunate creature an opportunity to run away. No sooner has the escape attempt been made than the revolver shots ring out. "He wanted to run away from me," the dutiful officer then reports to his superior; "I called him in the name of the Queen" (which is actually supposed to happen, but in English, which of course the poor devil doesn't understand), "but he kept running away; so I had no choice but to shoot him - justifiable homicide" is the note from the higher authorities, and that settles the matter. . . . .

The fact that, by its very nature, it cannot place the greatest emphasis on this aspect of colonial activity will not fail, in so far as it is of interest to our readers, to bring the information to their attention and to supplement and deepen the news from the colonies by extending their reporting. Literature. E. Catellani, La Colonixzaziono tedesca. 80 pp. (Separate reprint from the Giornale degli Economisti, vol. V, 1890). In this treatise the author, professor at the University of Bologna, gives an overview of the German colonial endeavours and their successes, the acquisition of the German territories, their political organization, their economic, geographical and ethnological conditions, the activities of the missions in them, the fight against the slave trade, etc., which testifies to a precise knowledge of the circumstances in question. A final chapter discusses the future of the German colonies. Here the author expresses his admiration for the fact that German vigor. The author expresses his admiration for the fact that Germany's energy and resourcefulness have enabled it to acquire extensive colonial possessions in such a short time, and he also praises the Reich government's purposeful colonial policy, which has managed to avoid any serious conflict with the older colonial powers while preserving Germany's dignity and rights. From the way in which Germany has acquired and established its colonies so far, the author believes he can take confidence that the German colonies, even if they cannot generally become destinations for emigration, will soon represent a valuable possession of the German Empire. The treatise is a new proof that in Italy not only the scientific, but also the economic and political efforts of Germany are followed with interest and sympathy.Si Reisen im Kongolonde by Dr. R. Büttner, 283 pp. k. 8° F. 1 map Heinrichssche Buchhandlung, Leiptig. The author of this book was a member of the Congo expedition organized by the "African Society in Germany" in 1884. The venture was begun with quite considerable resources by German standards, but its success was not commensurate with them. This may well have been partly due to the fragmentation of the expedition from the outset and the inadequate provision of porters. We are therefore all the more pleased to be presented with subsequent evidence of German activity, namely in the report contained in Volume 5 of the Mitteilungen der afrikanischen Gesellschaft and in the present work. Even if the former essay, which is half the size of the latter, is incomparably more valuable for general and specialist scholarship than the book published later, the latter nevertheless offers a contribution to knowledge of African travel life that should not be underestimated due to its truthful description. The readers of the Kolonialzeitung in particular, who, as is understandable, consist only in the smallest part of experts, should not miss the opportunity to gain a more precise knowledge of those regions and African conditions by reading the book. The explorer's actual journey overland begins at Ango=Ango and leads first to the fairly well-known capital of the old kingdom of Kongo, San Salvador. This place is of some interest due to its past, even if it may never have been as powerful and splendid as the old chroniclers tell us Büttner provides us with a good description of the present conditions, as well as of the noteworthy excursion to the Moidisi Falls and the Toto spring area. However, failures in finding porters caused a great deal of inconvenience in the further course of the expedition, just as the inadequate human material was a constant worry and obstacle for the traveler, and finally the penetration into geographically more important areas was prevented by the porters, over whom the guide was unable to gain any authority. The route passes through Muschilongo, Madimba. Lombo, Kongo dia Lase, touches the territory of the Majakalla, the towns of Muene Putu Kassongo and the residence of Muata Kiamwo of Majakka Fernerdin, the stone barre already known by Major von Mechow, situated on the Quango bel Kingundji, is reached. There are no traces of the boat allegedly left there by von M. The traveler receives a somewhat friendlier reception from the Muvumbas and one of their rulers, named Muene Kwako, a Majakko by birth, takes care of the poor troubled European in a more friendly manner than his predecessors. Bel Kiballa encounters the Erpeditien for the first time on the Congo and now walks not far from the course of the river to the Stanley Pool, where she takes a final rest in an abandoned station house of the international company near Kimpoko. The rest of the account of the journey concerns Leopoldstadt, the meeting with Wißmann's Congo expedition, an excursion to Aquatorstadt and the indirect return journey. The author describes the conditions on the Congo truthfully, without the exaggerated optimistic coloring that is unfortunately found in some so-called colonial enthusiasts, who thereby only harm the good cause. After that, the area he visited, like so many others in Africa, is not very promising. On the other hand, West Africa has such a large number of very productive areas, especially in comparison to East Africa, that its importance for European trade and industry is nevertheless increasing and highly significant. The view of missionary conditions is very much in line with the real situation, and it is to be hoped that the increasing voices of unprejudiced and logical men will finally help to abandon the present system and provide for the real moral upliftment and education of the Negroes in a better and more successful way. Incidentally, as with many other travelers, including the author, the French Jesuit missions, whose missionaries are domestic Germans, have made a more reasonable impression. It is interesting to note certain similarities in the customs of the population living here with those of the Guinea coast, even though they belong to a completely different group of Negroes. The name bamboo palm, so often used for the so-called wine palm (Raphla vinisera), is not an indigenous name from the Congo, but is common throughout the west coast and perhaps originated from Europeans because of the similarity of the leaf veins to bamboo. The author also rightly criticizes the lack of decoration of the Pogge grave at the time, which we also find at the Flegel grave in Braß and which could so easily have been avoided by a little more timely care and reverence in the leading social circles concerned. It is very regrettable that the traveler was unable to find out more about the secret societies and ritual segregations (Nkimba and Nkita). However, making inquiries among the Negroes at home is associated with great difficulties. Ethnography has been somewhat neglected, although there are hints of interesting similarities (e.g. messenger signs, the meaning of kola nuts, etc.). The very remarkable falling star mentioned on November 27, 1886 was also observed by Staudinger and Hartert in the western Sudan (see my metological notes "Jm Herzen der Haussaländer"). - The style in which the book is written must be called a good and fluent one, only the author probably needs some coastal words, e.g. dash. too often. The breadth of the work would have been considerably increased if it had been combined with the scientific observations published in the Mitteilungen der afrikanischen Gesellschaft, the discussion of which does not belong here, but in its present form it is perhaps more convenient for the wider colonial public to read.

With ley pieces, a systematic dictionary and ten charts. By A. Seidel. Vienna, Pest, Leipzig. A. Hartlebens Verlag. 198 S. 8°. Although there is no shortage of Japanese grammars, the choice has not been easy so far when it comes to a practical textbook of the colloquial language; at least Referent could not name one that met the requirements of such a textbook to the same extent as the present grammar. The whole material is clearly divided into 52 lessons, each of which contains a number of concisely and comprehensibly formulated rules, which are illustrated by exercises for translating from Japanese into German and vice versa. The vocabulary attached to each lesson enables the learner to acquire a considerable amount of lexical material in a short time and in a playful manner. The fact that the author has based his transcription on the German pronunciation is certainly to be approved of, except that the distinction between the hard and soft a by a and 2 would perhaps have been preferable to the spelling adopted by the author (ss and 2). If it is in any case unfortunate to express a simple sound by a compound sign, such a procedure has a completely disruptive effect in Japanese, since here double consonants are also regarded as such in pronunciation. The fact that the written language has also been given some consideration in addition to the colloquial language is only to the book's advantage, all the more so as the sharp distinction made in the rules prevents any confusion between the two Jdiems. The book concludes with six short readings and a glossary, as well as a systematic German-Japanese dictionary in 33 sections. It is to be emphasized with special thanks that the author has taken the trouble to add the corresponding Chinese characters to the numerous Chinese loan words contained in the dictionary on 10 written plates, which also contain a list of the 214 so-called radicals or class heads, as well as the syllable characters of the Katakana and Firakana and a short reading piece. These charts add considerably to the value of Seidel's grammar, as they enable the learner not only to learn to speak Japanese but also to read it. Reserent is convinced that anyone who works through the book can be assured of gratifying success, since the presentation and arrangement show decidedly didactic skill. Finally, it should not be left unmentioned that the layout of the little book is exemplary, and so, in view of the very moderate price, one may well hope that it will also find a well-deserved market.

Prince Vismarck and German colonial policy. Now that the great statesman who has led the affairs of the Reich and, in particular, the German colonial policy, has left the scene of his glorious activities, the question arises as to what influence the change in the position of Reich Chancellor will have on the further development of our colonial policy. If we look back over the last few years, we can see that there was much disgruntlement in pro-colonial circles. It was felt that the Foreign Office did not support the colonial endeavors with sufficient zeal, that its attitude betrayed a certain vacillation and that too much consideration was given to the good relations with England. How much truth there may be in these accusations made of Bismarck's colonial policy is not something we want to examine today. This would require a discussion of the individual cases and an impartial judgment could only be reached on the basis of a very precise knowledge of all the circumstances. The overall political situation in each case, with all its depths shrouded in diplomatic darkness, would also have to be taken into account. Today is not the time to criticize the activities of the first Reichskanzler in such detail; today it is more appropriate to thank him for the great services he rendered to the German people in the field of colonial policy. We must gratefully acknowledge that it was Prince Bismarck who led Germany onto the path of colonial policy and, through his both prudent and energetic approach, secured us a place among the nations endowed with overseas possessions. It was he who, from the very beginning, encouraged Germany's energetic participation in world trade and commerce in all directions, and in general promoted and supported Germany's overseas economic life, which was striving for development. Once he had come to the realization that the German people could not do without colonial policy in order not to be outstripped one day by the advancing civilized nations, he masterfully established the German colonies. Prince Bismarck largely accomplished the task of acquiring German colonies; it will be up to his successor to ensure that what has been gained is maintained and developed. An energetic resumption of the sometimes interrupted colonial threads is to be hoped for with confidence given the great interest that Kaiser Wilhelm shows in the German colonies - we recall the Kaiser's words discussed in No. 6 of the Deutsche Kolonial=Zeitung. It can be assumed as certain that not only the pending questions will be brought to a happy solution, but also that further systematic action will be taken, both economically and politically. German colonial policy now faces a highly important issue in Africa, where the hitherto incomplete delimitation of spheres of interest threatens to lead to disputes and to an impairment of German possessions. It is important to prevent the German colonies from being cut off from their hinterland, and it will take as much wisdom as determination to solve this task in such a way that Germany does not lose out. The successes that Major Wißmann has achieved in Africa must be consolidated and vigorously continued. Since the first priority is to combat the atrocities of slave hunts and the slave trade, which desecrate humanity, it can be confidently expected that the majority that has so far approved the funds to carry out Wißmann's undertaking will also remain faithful to the great work in the new Reichstag. With regard to the tasks to be solved in East Africa, we regard it as a particularly fortunate sign that the negotiations with Emin Pasha, which had already begun earlier, concerning his entry into the German colonial service have come to the desired conclusion. The fact that England begrudges him to us is the best proof - if any were needed - of the excellence of this one man who, after a thirteen-year stay in the tropics, barely recovered from a life-threatening illness, sets off again for the interior in order, as we assume, to secure the German sphere of interest and combat the slave trade. With him at the head, who knows how to treat both Arabs and natives in every respect, it should not be difficult for us to direct the cultural task awaiting us in the right direction and perhaps also to bring the domestic opponents of colonial policy so far on our side that they see in our striving for overseas expansion of power something more than a sport which, carried by a popular current, would fall with it. They will have to convince themselves that they are dealing here with a stirring of the German people's soul, which has arisen from the development of our time and is inevitably moving towards its completion, that there may be a temporary standstill but not a reversal on the path we have taken. We therefore also hope that it will gradually be possible to raise the colonial issue above party politics now that Prince Bismarck, against whom the attack was often directed personally, has left the stage. We should all endeavor to remain active in this direction as well. The recruitment of Emin Pasha for the German service should convince everyone that we are not cherishing fanciful plans, but that we are reckoning with given facts, that the "adventures" that are now being undertaken cease to be such with him in the alliance, that what appears incomprehensible and extremely bold from afar loses its fearsomeness for those who boldly face the dangers in Inner Africa, and that above all we should rely more on our own strength than before. Emin Pasha's genius will certainly allow him to reach his lofty goal unharmed, for the honor of mankind as well as for the good of the fatherland, and we can give him no better motto to take with him than that naval command which the Emperor recently telegraphed to Weimar on the occasion of Prince Bismarck's resignation, and which marks the beginning of the new Ara: "And now full steam ahead!"

From the German Emin Pasha expedition. According to the latest news that Mr. O. Borchert received from natives on the upper Tana River, Dr. Peters and Lieutenant v. Tiedemann were supposed to have set out from Oda=Boru=Ruva between 10 and 15 November last year with 8 camels, 6 donkeys, 1 horse, about 60 porters and 25 Somalis in order to march through Massailand to "the great lake".*) Recently, Mr. Ehlers, who, as our readers know, had gone from Pangani to Kilimanjaro at the end of December with a detachment of Wissmann's Schutztruppe, sent a message to Mombassa that Dr. Peters and Lieutenant v. Tiedemann, together with 40 porters, had arrived safely at Lake Ukerewe; v. Tiedemann had only been slightly wounded in a battle near Kavirondo. The telegram in question provides no information as to the source of the news requested by Mr. Ehlers, whether it is merely based on a rumour spread among the natives or whether it is based on information sent by Petero himself through messengers. We are therefore not in a position to judge the credibility of Ehlers' message in this respect; we can only assume that Mr. Ehlers would not have forwarded the message if he had not considered it credible himself. Taking into account the distances between Lake Ukerewe and Kilimanjaro, as well as between the latter and Mombassa, one comes to the conclusion that the time to which the message refers was about two months before the arrival of the message on the coast, i.e. around the last days of January or the beginning of February. At this time, Dr. Peters could very well have completed his march from the Kenya region through Massailand and reached the Ukerewesce, in particular the Kavirondo region on the eastern shore of this lake. Whether he, following his original plan, first went to Lake Baringo and then, perhaps only after receiving news of Emin's departure from Wadelai, turned towards Lake Ukerewesce, or whether he marched directly from the Kema station to this lake, can only be speculated on. The latter assumption gains some probability from the fact that the people Borchert spoke to referred to the "big lake" as the destination of Dr. Peters' journey through Massailand. Kavirondo Bay is the point at which the demarcation line between the English and German spheres of interest reaches Lake Ukerewe. If Peters has moved south from there, he has re-entered the German sphere of interest and is in an area where he may encounter Emin Pasha on his forthcoming march. Perhaps in this way we will receive further news of the fate of our brave compatriots who have penetrated deep into the interior of the dark part of the world to reach out to Emin. The above had already been printed when the following dispatch, addressed to the executive committee of the German Emin Pasha Committee and posted in Zanzibar on the evening of April 8, was received: "Received letter from Peters, dated Kapte Kamassia 16th Jannar; he as well as Tiedemann are well, his letter to you follows. Hansing. ("Kapte" is a caravan site west of Lake Baringo, "Kamassia" the name of a mountain range there; see Thompson "Durch Massai=Land" pp. 264, 409, 413.) The Great South. The Rusiji=Ulanga=Linic]. (Conclusion.) 1 (With map.) Above the Schuguli Falls the Rusiji divides into the Ulanga and Luwego, of which the former has been navigated by Count Pfeil, the latter is as yet unknown. Count Pfeil, coming from the north, came across the Ulanga in its middle course and was extremely surprised by the mightiness of this river system. He estimated the river in its middle course at an average of 300 meters, see Vorchert's report in No. 7 of the Kolonialzeitung. A misleading printing error has crept into this report, which we must correct: approximately in the middle of the last paragraph are the words: "I believe you" - it should read "I believe them (namely the natives).
although in places this width has been significantly exceeded. His companion, who knows the Rhine very well, claimed that nowhere does it reach the average size of the Ulanga. At its narrowest point in the upper reaches, he trigonometrically determined the width of the river to be approximately 68 meters. The water is greenish-brown in color throughout and only has a strong current in narrow places or at short bends, of which the river has a large number. It is accompanied on both sides by high mountains, which extend to the Nyassa on its left bank and give it its origin here. In its upper reaches, the Ulanga flows through immense swamps, the extent of which is incredible. Count Pfeil writes about it: "When we were lost in it with our boat towards Christmas of 1885, we could only make out the peaks of the Ubeber Mountains in the distance, which appeared gray in the oppressively hot, hazy atmosphere of the swamps. Otherwise, all around in the NE and 8W, there was only a tangle of slippery peaks, long sedge, a nodding of poplar bushes and still a rigid, motionless surface, yellow and gray=green. The upper river region is inhabited by several tribes of people who are subjugated by the strong and warlike Mahenge and Masiti and lead their miserable lives in constant flight or war on the low and unhealthy banks or on the large islands of the river. The Ulanga, with its swamps, its many arms and wide waters, forms a barrier that cannot easily be crossed and has therefore become a divide between peoples. Warlike tribes live along its left bank. The actual Masiti live in the mountains at the north-eastern end of the Nyassa, then come the Wabena, who were subjugated by the Wahehe but have been completely absorbed into their nation, followed by the really warlike Wahehe. Then, following the course of the river, one comes to the Mahenge, who are also warlike and have pushed the peaceful peoples to the right bank of the Ulanga, where they live without chiefs and only pay tribute to their tormentors on the left bank of the river. Birdlife is abundant on the river, while the vegetation, apart from the swampy area, is less rich. Where the banks are not cultivated with rice, there are actually only very tall, dambus-like reeds or reeds, from whose hard stems the natives living on the Ulanga build their houses. On the lower part of its banks, this fringe of bushes covers the river for long stretches. Only here and there is a solitary palm tree (Hyphaena), which usually serves as an eyrie for an eagle, which is quite common here and is characterized by the beautiful colouring of its plumage. The river is very rich in fish. At the end of his report, Count Pfeil says: "In its lower course, the river stretches to an extraordinary width. Its smallest depth was 3 m. Its greatest depth was not reached by means of a sounding pole 6 m long. River steamers of all sizes could navigate this river, which also has the advantage of connecting the fertile lands in its lower course with the highlands that extend behind the mountains, the foot of which the Ulanga washes almost directly in its upper course. A waterway such as the Ulanga forms must, however, be of the greatest importance for the countries in its area; hopefully it will not be too long before it actually becomes so." If one looks at the overall picture of the Rusiji river system, it does not seem impossible, assuming that the observations of the travelers are generally valid, to reach the Nyassa on this route with much greater ease than on one of the land routes starting from Kilwa and Lindi. It is important, as Count Pfeil rightly points out in his "Proposals for Practical Colonization in East Africa", that the upper course of the river runs almost directly up to the 6,000-foot-high Uhehe Hills, "which form the high plateau of Uhehe and Übena and, with their cool climate, abundant, albeit small watercourses and large herds of cattle, promise the colonist a settlement area similar to the Orange Free State in South Africa. However, plans to achieve this are still a long way off, as the northern Usambara offers settlement areas that are much easier to reach if European immigrants are to be settled in East Africa at all. The trade on the northern Nyassa is, as the English consulate reports show, not so important that large expenditures for road construction would be advisable, but if a cnergic approach is to be made in the south, this route cannot be ignored. Apart from the area between the Schuguli and Pangani Falls, the construction of a suitable route is likely to be more difficult,

The extension of the route to Lake Nyassa is a good idea, as the ascent to the high plateau is considerable. Close to the eastern bank of the Nyassa are the Livingstone Mountains, which reach an altitude of 7,000 to 8,000 feet according to Thomson's calculations at the north-eastern corner, from where rivers and streams flow between high rock faces into the Ryassa. According to Stewart, the Konde Mountains are a continuation of the Livingstone Range, which extends from the lake in a north-westerly direction. In any case, the plateau drops quite steeply to the west. However, as no one has yet penetrated from the furthest point, from Ulanga, which Count Pfeil reached, to Lake Nyassa, anything that could be said about it would only be hypothesis. The whole of the vast area between the Ulanga and Rovuma, roamed and deserted by the wild Magwangwara, still awaits geographical development and it would perhaps be appropriate that, after the south has been regained, the

The attention of the geographical circles of our fatherland turned to this region. Wißmann's expedition to the south was probably limited to the coastal areas. If he considers it necessary to run boats on the Rusiji in order to prevent slave traffic between the landscapes, then at least the one big question of whether the Rusiji is navigable without excessive difficulty will certainly be solved. Coal deposits in East Africa. The important question of whether or not hard coal is to be found in our East African protectorate was answered in the affirmative by German geologists years ago, but so little information about actual hard coal discoveries has reached the daily press that a compilation of English reports on this subject can claim to be of general interest. Such reports, we might add, have not attracted any attention in England either. Only the negative or at least unfavorable reports of geologists such as Thompson or Drummond, who was sent to the Nyassa by the African Lakes Co. in 1883, are generally known; the discoveries and finds of laymen (mainly consuls and missionaries) are only mentioned in the bluebooks of the English government, the organs of the missionary societies and the proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society in London. The Comptes rendus de la Société de Geographie de P'aris also contain many interesting facts about African coal discoveries that one would look for in vain elsewhere. It is now almost thirty years since coal was found on the Rovuma, our southern border river. In March 1861, Livingstone's steamer the "Pioneer" sailed up the river under Lieutenant May's*) command. It was just after the rainy season, and relatively few difficulties were encountered. Nevertheless, they turned back after only a few days. The attempt was renewed in September of the following year. As the river had very little water, they had to use rowing boats and the pioneer stayed behind at the mouth of the Rovuma. This time the rapids were reached and on September 17th Dr. Kirk (later Sir John Kirk) found pieces of coal on the sandy banks of the river. "The pieces were round and abraded by the water, as if they had been carried some distance". Livingstone says in his work "Expedition to the Zambesi River": "It is well known to the natives that the coal found on the sandbanks of the Rovuma burns", and adds: "Already at the small Chidia Lake (a body of water situated very near the mouth of the Rovuma on the German side of the river, which is in communication with it at high tide) we saw the same sandstone with fossil wood (sic!) on it and knew for certain that coal must be underneath. This discovery had no further consequences. Kirk concludes his reports with the words: "If ever a local industry should spring up on the banks of the Rovuma, the river may carry down the products of it at the time of high water. . . . but that day is still far away. The only person interested in the discoveries of the English was the Sultan of Zanzibar, Seyid Majid, the predecessor of Bargash. The expedition he sent out did, however, bring back coal. However, these were weathered pieces hewn from the surface, which were examined by Indian government officials in Bombay and declared "suitable for local use only". The pieces sent back contained 25 percent ash. It was not until 1878 that Seyid Bargash repeated the experiment, with the help of the English missionaries from Masasi. His expedition*) went up the river, passed the rapids, which had forced Livingstone and Kirk to turn back, without difficulty and reached a place on the southern arm of the Rovuma, the Lujenda (also called Liende), where the coal came to light on the rocky shores of the islands. In 1881, the Englishman Thomson was sent out on behalf of the Sultan to ascertain whether this coal seam was worth mining. A few years earlier, after the death of the geographer Keith Johnston, Thomson had been at the head of a major exploration expedition and had been so fortunate as to increase our knowledge of Inner Africa considerably; he was not yet 20 years old when *) The London Hydrographieal Offico published a map of the lower course of the Rovuma (approx. 50 kilometers) in 1862. Kirk Notes on two expeditions up the River Rovuma. Proreedings of the Royal Geographical Society London. Vol. XXXV p. 154-167. approx. 30-35 kilometers from Mikindanihafen. *) Proccedings of the Royal Geographical Society 1881 pp. 660 and following.
"Geologist of the expedition", he had gone out and returned a man of accomplishment and a successful explorer. One can easily imagine the Sultan's disappointment when the distinguished European returned and claimed that the coal could not be found in the place he had indicated. In the Blue Book 1881 p. 212, however, Kirk writes to the Foreign Office that Thomson did find something, but it was "a bituminous shale". Be that as it may, Bargasch did not trust Thomson at all, but he waited four years before deciding to try again. This time (summer 1884) he sent Mr. Angelvy, a French engineer, on the search." Thomson had already spurned the Rovuma as an itinerary and had traveled from Mikindani Bay. Angelvy, who wanted a practical route to the coalfields, went from Lindi to the interior. He was probably motivated to do so by the reports of Lieutenant Callaghan, who had sailed the river that flows into the bay at Lindi in a steam launch. After following a beautiful waterway (not less than 8 feet deep) for 15 kilometers, he had had to turn back at a point where the river suddenly shrank to 10 meters wide. Angelvy now found that the river (called Ukeredi), already 20 kilometers from the mouth, was only a stream, so it could never provide a route to the coal region, and crossed the savannahs of the Pao. The latter rise to an altitude of 2800 feet near Masasi*) and are covered with rocky hills everywhere else, in which Mr. Angelvy believed to see copper veins. In any case, he dragged back samples of malachite with him. Arriving at the Rovuma, he crossed the river, walked up the Lujenda and found the coal camp without difficulty. He followed the latter for 50 kilometers, drilling and taking samples all along the way. He declared the coal to be excellent, complained about the great distance to the coast, the shallow depth of the Rovuma (he traveled in the dry season) and finally declared that Bargasch intended to build a railroad from the coast to the coal fields. It is interesting to compare this report in the Comptes rendus with that of Sir John Kirk to his government: "I believe that Angelvy's discovery is correct, he writes, "I have always been convinced that there is coal at Rovuma. . . .. The time may come when coal will be quite desirable halfway between the coast and the Nyassa. About the geologically interesting plain between Lindi and Rovuma (the south-east corner of our reserve) in which Angelvy claimed to have found copper and iron veins, Kirk says: "The missionaries have found precious garnet stones and other precious stones of considerable value at their stations.*) He even suspects the presence of diamonds at another location, basing this on findings of rock crystals and other minerals. He says of the quality of the coal found by Angelvy that it was equal to that of samples he had previously sent to India for examination.") He only calls it: "fairly good. Let us now leave the Rovuma and turn to Lake Nyassa. Not only have we received reports of coal discoveries from there, but there are also very precise geographical positionings of the sites, and even appraisals of the coal found by recognized authorities. The first positive news comes from the Proceedings of the Geographical Society*). A mission official, Mr. Rhodes, finds coal south of Florence Bay, which is located on the western shore of the lake at about 10° 40' latitude. Besides a vein 5-6 feet thick, he finds a smaller one in the immediate vicinity. The very next year, 1881, the Scottish missionary Vr. Laws received orders from his missionary society to "make a survey of the east coast of the lake with the purpose of locating a harbour there and looking for a place to establish a station in the vicinity" Dr. Laws discovered a large bay with good anchorage opposite Florence Bay. He finds coal on the shore and follows it up a creek. Two natives promise to show him the place where the coal comes to light on the hills, but it is still a six-hour walk. The newly discovered harbor was *) Comptes rendus de la Societé de Géographie de Paris June 5 Station of the Universities Mission. Hluchook and Proceedinge. It seems that Kirk had already reported earlier on coal finds in London, but apart from the passages cited, none of importance can be found in the Bluobooks. 1879 p. 312. *) Proccodings Geogr. Soc. London 1881 p. 42.

Mbampa, according to Johnson *) "the best harbor on the lake," at about latitude 11° 20, i.e. just north of the border agreed with Portugal. Johnson did not have time to march to the coal camp, and although his successors often sailed into the port of Mbampa, the missionaries never seem to have settled on the east coast for reasons that would go too far to explain here. If we return to the west coast, coal seems to have been found almost everywhere on the northern half of the coast. The engineer Jas. Stewart went to the mouth of the Rikuru River at 10° 45° 15" on September 22, 1880, to examine the coal found by Mr. Rhodes. He reached the stream in which Rhodes had first discovered the coal a beer kilometer to the north. He says of it: "The coal lies inclined at an angle of 45° to the west. It outcrops only a distance of 30 feet, and the vein is 5-7 feet thick. It looks as if it came here by a fall, for there are pieces mixed with clay everywhere. Nevertheless, the vein is compact and full of good coal, which I was able to follow along the slope of the hills for 300 paces by scratching it here and there. The site is 2 kilometers from the shore of the lake and 500 feet above it. I lit a proper fire, which blazed up strongly. The coal bakes a little, but not so much as to hinder combustion rc. rc. Let us conclude with an extract from the report of Mr. Carruthers, F. R. S. Keeper of the botanical department of the British Museum, to whom Mr. Stewart sent specimens for examination. "The exterior of the coal sent is like good English coal ... I find in it the macrospores of lycopodiaceae, which are indistinguishable from those in English coal. When the coal is burnt, only one and eighteenth percent ash remains. There is no doubt that the Nyassa coal sample is the same age as the English coal. Even though none of these reports reached the general public, they aroused the greatest interest among those initially involved. The officials of the African Maritime Companies continued their investigations and found gold in the immediate vicinity of the Nyassaufer, as well as asbestos on the north-western part of the same.*) At Rovuma, Serpa Pinto rushed over to take possession of the coal seams for Portugal. Seyid Bargash's soldiers, who (probably at Kirk's instigation*) also marched up the Lujenda, arrived too late, and who can say what turn the race for the coal seams would have taken if political turmoil and disputes, on the coast Germany and Zanzibar, on the Nyassa the Arabs of Karonga and the Maritime Company, had not concentrated all attention on themselves at that very moment. The struggle for possession of East Africa naturally pushed all interest in economic issues into the background. Today, however, when we are on the point of permanently occupying the south of our protectorate, which we acquired four years ago, when land-hungry England is stretching out its hand for Portugal's possession of the Nyassa, it is time for us to realize what we have to lose or gain there.

In 1846 the German population in the United States is given for the states as a percentage of the resident population. 17500 Illinois 331. 300000 Indiana 33½ 50000 Jowa 75000 Michigan 90 000 Missouri 700 000 New-York 800000 Ohio 800 000 Pennsylvania 30 000 Texas 100 000 Wisconsin. *) Proceedings 1884 p. 515. Proceedings 1881 p. 265. Proceedings 1889 p. 690 and flg. see also Scotch Geogr. Magazine. *) See Sir John Kirk's letters. Bluedook 1885.
The German population of 1846 with its numerous descendants cannot be completely Anglicized for the reason that there has been no lack of strong growth from the old homeland since then. The ratio of immigrant Germans to other nationalities in the 1880 census also shows the predominance of the German element in several of these states. Of the economically active immigrants employed in agriculture in 1880, Germans made up 47.8 percent in Illmnois, 63.7 percent in Indiana, 38.9 percent in Jowa, 58.9 percent in Missouri, 57.6 percent in Ohio, 40.6 percent in Pennsylvania, 40.2 percent in Texas, and 40.2 percent in Ohio, in Texas 40.2 percent, in Wisconsin 44.1 percent. With the exception of Pennsylvania, more German immigrants are employed in agriculture in these states than English-speaking British=Americans, Englishmen, Scotsmen and Irishmen put together. One can hardly doubt that in these states Germanism will once again come to great prominence as soon as it comes to its own senses. With the recognition of the principle that the individuality receives strength and support through the significance of the nation and through the connection with the country of origin, the hope gains that the times can become different. In the United States, the German and the English people were unequal. The German humbly sought work and sustenance; the English considered his modesty and politeness to be beggary. The Germanism of today is different from that of the past, which is why the constant increase in those states is more valuable today than ever before. The German no longer places his people so low that in future he will humbly and beggingly submit to foreigners. The lack of self-consciousness and confidence is disappearing more and more, and the consciousness of nationality and race is growing. The abuse which English candidates for office make of the German vote will cease; Germans will then be duly represented among civil servants, judges, members of legislative bodies and Congress, whereas hitherto they have been as good as unrepresented. And as the rising intellectual and financial forces in our people begin to successfully elevate our nation to a higher rank, to participate in the world economy by means of an extensive culture, this national and economic upswing of his old homeland will not leave the German-American untouched; therefore one must wish, which fortunately cannot be prevented at all, that the old Germanness in the German states of the Union will be constantly rejuvenated by fresh blood until it is ripe for development. These considerations do not exclude the concern that we should begin earlier to transplant some of the German emigrants to other areas, before the conditions of employment in the United States become so difficult that immigration there will naturally decrease of its own accord." The circles and societies in Germany, which are endeavoring to divert our emigration away from the United States and towards the Latin countries of South America, want to assert the reasonable principle of preserving the German emigrant nationally and not allowing his labor to be lost to the mother country. In both respects, conditions in the United States do not allow any prospect of immediate profit. Now, any such direction of emigration implies a certain degree of responsibility for the welfare of the transplanted settler as a result of arbitrary intervention. Accordingly, a private company engaged in colonization cannot do without the help of either the domestic or the foreign government, and it must be sufficiently well-funded to meet crises and emergencies. If only one of these three factors were to fail to cooperate or to provide insufficient support for the enterprise, the responsibility for the entrepreneurs would be so great that they would do better to refrain from it and leave the choice of his new home to the emigrant himself. Mutual interests and needs have often supported German colonization ventures in the American South. It is primarily the three Brazilian provinces of Rio Grande do Sul, Sta. Catharina and Paraná where the immigrant Germans seem to feel at home. In the years from 1871 *) Engelbrecht, in his treatise already mentioned, assumes that the public lands of the Union will have been so far transferred to private ownership around the year 1890 that there will be no free land left for homesteads. This is probably related to the fact that the law has now made it more difficult for those without means to immigrate. Cf. Journal of the Royal Prussian Statistical Bureau. 1887. S. 90.

Page 94

By 1888, 33,443 Germans had immigrated to Brazil; certainly a small number compared to the efforts of German settlement companies for this country. However, this number is likely to increase rapidly as soon as the good progress of the Germans in these countries is more secure. It is to be regretted that capital, our industry and our trade have not long since joined forces for larger colonization ventures here; but perhaps it is still possible to obtain sufficient land and concessions for this purpose. For such an enterprise, however, individual stretches of land will not suffice, nor some support from the foreign government in terms of money for the passage, initial accommodation of the immigrants, etc., but the entire province of Parani, for example, would have to be won over for it; the colonization company would have to carry out the settlements itself over an extensive area with the right to keep out foreign disturbing elements. From the moment that German settlement is determined in Paraná, the Brazilian government must not place the same value on Italians, Britons, Spaniards, etc. for this area as on Germans. Unfortunately, a large part of the government lands in the aforementioned provinces has been lost to land speculators, but the question is worth examining as to who was given and enfeoffed with it and in whose hands it is in a colonization enterprise that could offer help to the settlers in cases of crises and red due to its capital strength, which would also combine the interests of the settler with the interests of domestic industry and national trade in a beneficial way, in such an enterprise our Prussian government would also have to find enough guarantees to enable it to revoke the rescript of 1859 prohibiting emigration to Brazil. The La Plata states were even less affected by German emigration than Brazil, while German trade with Argentina and Uruguay developed in the best possible way. In the Republic of Argentina, the largest of the three La Plata states in terms of size, the Italian element is so prevalent in immigration that Professor Napp said years ago: Agentinia, apart from Entre Rios and the Misiones, is as good as lost to Germanic colonization, it will become the Italy of the New World. In fact, Italian immigration is on the increase, whereas German immigration is negligible. We take the following figures from the latest official publications on immigration to the Republic of Argentina: German immigration to the Republic of Argentina in the years 1870 to 1888: 1870 1871 1872 1873 1874 1875 1876 1877 1878 155 269 793 392 354 303 387 1879 1880 1881 1882 1883 1884 1885 1886 1887 1888 490 445 591 1128 1388 1261 1546 1131 1333 1536.

The Italian immigrants, who account for 65.25 percent of the total immigration, have such a significant preponderance that Napp's fears are supported by the figures. The same author, who is well acquainted with the conditions in Argentina, now mentions the province of Entre Rios, where conditions are more favorable for German immigration. In the early eighties it would certainly have been possible to obtain government lands for the purpose of settling Germans here at first hand, but in recent years there has been a significant deterioration. In 1886, 6,063,222 hectares of the government lands in the province had already been sold, while only 1,106,778 hectares remained unsold. The average sale price per hectare was 4.91 dollars (almost 20 marks. *) Thus 80 percent of the total government land had already been sold at a relatively good price in 1886, and it can be assumed that this part comprised the better lands. Recently, offers of land have often arrived in Germany from Argentina, offering larger complexes in the provinces of Buenos Aires, Santa Fé and Entre Rios, which are suitable for German settlement, at a price of 40 marks per hectare. If a settlement company were to enter into such a transaction, it can be predicted with some certainty that it would have to ruin itself or the German farmers whom it would induce to settle in a short time. The German government could justly forbid such a business as a swindle if German emigrants were in danger of being affected by it. Without the protection of a native society which enjoys the confidence of the German government, the German emigrant in Argentina will usually be exposed to great dangers. The parcelling out of land in Argentina is mainly carried out by landowner consortia and is therefore purely commercial speculation. According to the calculations of Dr. J. Ch. Heusser*), 100 to 120,000 francs per square legua are extracted in this business; this is said to occur with mediocre land for cattle breeding, which would be well paid at 40,000 francs. It is quite irrelevant to our question whether these fears are completely, partially or not at all justified, the colonization conditions of Argentina in themselves offer no guarantee for the well-being of the settlers. There is no well-founded estimate of the productive capacity of the land in each individual case; in bad years the colonist generally has to buy the necessary credit at too high a price; the administration of justice is inadequate or biased in many places; all such inconveniences and dangers to which the individual immigrant is exposed leave the speculator and colony entrepreneur, who does not come into contact with the colonists at all, indifferent. The contradictory press voices and the advertisements of interested parties and emigration agents of the individual colonies cannot provide us with any security for our emigrants. The concerns described above have so far also stood in the way of German colonization in Uruguay, while German settlements have already begun in the Republic of Paraguay through the mediation of German companies. The South American Colonization Society in Leipzig began its settlement activities in this province in 1884 and a society in Chemnitz followed this example in 1887. The fact that there is no lack of space for people in Paraguay is immediately obvious when one considers that the republic had well over a million inhabitants before the start of the last devastating wars (1867-1870), whereas the population is now only 15. According to the census of June 1886, the counted population amounted to 23,1878 Paraguayans and 7896 immigrants; the total population, on the other hand, is estimated at about 263,000 Scelen.*) The majority of the immigrants are Argentines with 4805 souls, followed by Italians with d25, Brazilians 530, Germans 476, Spaniards 321, French 228 and so on. However, the value of the land is no longer in proportion to the small population. The usable government lands have all been sold; large land complexes have been acquired by capitalists in Buenos Aires, who have recently been granted a concession by the government to found a Paraguayan mortgage bank with extensive privileges. In addition, the Republic of Paragnay itself was particularly hard hit by the wars of 1865-1870, the number of which is given as 250,000 for the period calculated, so that the total number of people who immigrated to Argentina between 1857 and 1888 is 1621,797.

The country has fallen into debt, so that it is so dependent on its creditors that German colonization companies must find this state of emergency disturbing over time. The revenue from the sale of land has already been spent without any benefit for colonization'), while the customs duties for import and export amount to an average of 20% of the value? The land complexes which the two German companies mentioned are aiming to colonize are only small in size and, given their climatic and soil conditions, are likely to be very suitable in the main; the question is whether these companies will be able to protect their German settlers sufficiently from crises and make it easier for them to settle. This will be all the more appropriate here as the Paraguayan government, with the best will in the world, would hardly be able to provide sufficient material support for the colonization. This is not the place to go into this question in particular, as we can only deal with the assessment of the general settlement conditions as they prevail in one area and another Next in line for the number of immigrants is Australia as the destination of German emigration. In the period from 1871 to 1888, 16841 Germans sought a new home there. Australia received relatively little attention in Germany's leading colonial policy circles. This reluctance was mainly due to the fear that the fruits would fall to the English. Some experts on the country and the circumstances do not entirely share this view when they argue that emigration and colonization are a question of labour and capital power, which could also be solved in a national sense by Germans on Australian soil. More detailed studies in this direction should be made soon, which will show the prosperity of closed German settlements by location and opportunity in Australia better than at present. If we now also take a cursory look at German emigration to Africa, which amounted to 4047 Scelen in the same period, the destination of which will preferably have been the subtropical south, since the tropical countries cannot be considered for German emigration, it can only be stated with regret that in German Southwest Africa virtually nothing has yet been done for German colonization. However, now that the German government has decided to ensure the safety of persons and property, it is to be hoped that the foundations for German settlements in the hinterland of our South African possessions will now be examined and determined in more detail. Finally, we can leave Asia, to which some 1086 people have emigrated in the last 17 years, undiscussed, so that we can once again briefly summarize our statements on the aims of German emigration in the following sentences: 1. The main destination of German emigrants is and will probably remain for some time to come: the United States of America. Since property and employment conditions there are becoming less favorable than in the past, and since there is still the danger that Germans will become Anglicized and, moreover, competitors of their mother country, the efforts to divert a part of German emigration from the United States are justified. But it is by no means desirable that the immigration of new German elements to the States of the Union with a predominantly German population should cease altogether. (2) The recommendation of the southern provinces of the Empire of Brazil and the La Plata States for German settlements must be recognized as justified as soon as the obtaining of the necessary concessions by the government concerned is assured, and the colonization enterprise is begun with considerable capital. Any arbitrary management of the emigrant implies the responsibility for its protection and custody; from a colonization*) The fact that the proceeds of the tax are deprived of their natural purpose is a serious detriment to colonization; in 1887 Congress appropriated 2 million dollars from the proceeds of land sales for charitable purposes, of which S 250,000 were spent on the capital alone: S 250,000 for the expansion of the harbor, - 350,000 for the paving of highways, - 345,000 for other buildings and only 8,500,000 for road construction in the country. *) In 1886, imports amounted to 3 1 917 503 and exports to 8 2 103012, of which customs duties amounted to 3 798 221 and 8 113 158 respectively. The two main export articles are Paraguayan tea (herba mate) and tobacco; herda mate accounted for 8 69 843 and tabal for 3 15 592.
However, this venture can only be expected to be successful if it can be attacked with significant capital, with the settler forgoing a direct pension from his pocket. 3. Australia should not be rejected as a settlement area for Germans because it belongs to the British; nevertheless, Germanism today can assert itself and develop there, provided that German labor and German capital find the conditions and, above all, sufficient space for their activities and can secure them for themselves. 4. In addition to the areas mentioned, special reference must be made to Southwest Africa as a future destination for our emigration. It is likely that very favorable conditions will be found here for some of our emigrants, for which the German possessions, for example the isolated German settlements on the Orange River, already provide bases. III. Disadvantages and advantages of German emigration. Various calculations have been made of the loss which the fatherland suffers through the departure of numerous citizens, who, with their labor, also carry away not small amounts of capital from their homeland. Thus Faunthorpe calculates that immigration to Canada in the years from 1850 to 1880, which amounted to about half a million, increased the rational wealth by 335 million dollars. According to this, the average immigrant is worth 650 pounds sterling to the country.) Professor Rein assumes that each German emigrant has cost the sum of 1000 marks in maintenance and education, that each immigrant contributes the existing sum of 300 marks in cash to the new country. According to this, the national prosperity suffers a loss of 230 million marks annually with an annual emigration of 100,000 souls.*) The calculations of American statisticians go far beyond this sum. They estimate the cost of education for each person over 16 years of age at 150 marks per year, i.e. 2400 marks per capita, as well as the productive labor force of the immigrants, which they estimate as a financial tax force of 1200 dollars - 4926 marks per capita, and finally the cash capital brought along by the immigrants, which experience has shown to have amounted to an average of 200 dollars for each immigrant German. This results in the following interesting statistical example: In the years from 1815 to 1878, 4,000,000 people emigrated from Germany, of which ½5 of this number should be counted as adults: 7680,000,000 marks. Educational costs 3,200,000 x 2400 Capital taken 3,200,000 2 assuming only 150 dollars - 616½ M. 1,972,800,000 Material labor, that of male emigrants at 55 percent - 2,200,000 per. 10,837,200,000 sonen & 4926 M. Total 20,490,000,000 M. "This list of figures," remarks Ernst v. Weber, to whom we attribute the same,*) "seems a little monstrous because of the colossal sum, but will probably be correct in the main. Official figures from the Prussian state estimate per capita emigration in 1848/9 - 195 Thaler, 1851/2 - 201 Thaler, 1862/3 - 210 Thaler, whereby, by the way, only those who declare that they own any property at all are included. The emigrants advised by the Berlin Central Association declared (with the same restriction) an average of 289 Thaler in assets in 1851, and 231 Thaler in 1852. In 1852/3, the Franksurter Verein calculated the sum of 354 fl. per head. In Bavaria, emigrants took an average of 298 fl. with them in the years from 1835 to 1844, and 424 fl. in the years from 1844 to 1851. In contrast, a Württemberg emigrant took an average of 188 florins with him in 1855, 300 florins in 1857 and 790 florins in 1858.*) Fried. Kapp calculates 750 thalers as the lowest amount of capital emigrating with each German; namely an average of 150 thalers per head in cash and 600 thalers for education costs.*) Rein's and Kapp's estimates are pretty much the same and cannot be considered too high.

should be regulated by the Reich, which is to be expected soon, more precise data for this important assessment will in any case be obtained through more comprehensive records of the emigrants' financial circumstances, which are usually known precisely enough to the home authorities, as well as from the emigrants' own statements about their circumstances. A further disadvantage, which particularly affects certain parts of the country that are already sparsely populated, is the fact that by far the majority of emigrants are adults. The number of people over the age of 15 tends to be over 70 percent. The emigration of 1871-1880 affected Mecklenburg with the lowest population density and the highest emigration rate in relation to the population; Mecklenburg (1880 census) has 43.4 inhabitants per square kilometer, whereas the emigration of 1871-1880 per mil of the 1875 population was 44.9. Pomerania immediately follows in second place with 51.2 inhabitants per square kilometer and 44.0 per mil of emigrants. The following data on population density indicate the status as of December 1, 1880; the figures relating to emigration contain the results determined in the years 1871-1880') per mill of the population of 1875. population emigration density per of 1871 the square kilometer 1880 per mill meter of the 1875 population. population.

In 1875, there were 58.54 young people for every 100 productive people in the entire Prussian state. The ratio was much less favorable in the administrative district of Köslin, 100: 67.44, which is most likely connected with the strong Pomeranian emigration. In Mecklenburg, field work is said to have become noticeably worse because the strong people emigrate, leaving children and old people behind.*) These evils can be partially alleviated in some hard-hit areas if the lords of the manor provide more security for their workers in the future; the interests of small farmers should be protected as far as possible, for example by limiting the damage caused by game,*) by reducing taxes, by partially free use of the forest, where the small farmer can only procure fuel with difficulty elsewhere, etc. If we could limit emigration in individual parts of the country by means of the above-mentioned and similar measures, this would also prevent a further disadvantage, namely that excessive emigration would weaken the tax and military power of individual parts of the country too much. It follows from the nature of German emigration that the powers of the state cannot combat the evil with laws and prohibitions; the loss which our economic life and the military capacity of our people suffer through German emigration in its present form can only be limited to certain limits by protective measures and by expanding the sources of income. W. Roscher very aptly calls German emigration in its present form the negative form, because it is to be regarded almost as a pure loss of our national economy, in contrast to the colonizing form, under which the surplus forces which the fatherland can or must give up to the outside world are gathered outside and sought to be maintained in economic relations with the mother country. We shall have to discuss this subject in the section on organized emigration. *) R. Jannasch, German Tasks in the Present. Leipzig, 1885. W. Roscher, l. c. *) On the island of Rügen, the damage caused by game, most of which falls to the tenants, amounts to 1 to 1/ of the entire harvest.
The great disadvantages of our present-day emigration are not offset by a single direct advantage. Indirectly, of course, it must be seen as an advantage for the beginning of extensive culture in Germany that Germans have already spread and settled in all parts of the world. Those who find the opportunity to do so outside will certainly join the German efforts to make our culture and our trade more effective in foreign countries, will certainly join them wherever a narrow-minded conception of their personal interests does not make them completely deny their Germanness One can therefore quite well recognize in German emigration a world-historical moment for the preparatory world position of the German race in the cultural and economic life of the nations. Another advantage, which is more visible to us, is the fact that the departure of many people who had made it difficult for them to earn a living in their homeland, makes it easier for those who stayed behind to get ahead. This needs no further proof when we realize from the census of 1880 the large number of gainfully employed immigrant Germans in the United States of America, most of whom have found an excellent livelihood there. Let us take the occupational groups: Agriculture, trade, transportation, industry, crafts and mining, the figures given on p. 71 in No. 6 immediately show how inconceivable it is that these people could have found a similar livelihood, let alone an equally good livelihood, in their home country. It is this circumstance above all that makes it necessary to combat emigration in its present form, to organize it in such a way that the emigrants, through their work in a foreign place, contribute to extending the foundations of the old homeland's livelihood by means of the wider connection with the mother country. With regard to the disadvantages and advantages of German emigration, we come to the following conclusion: 1. German emigration in its present form is a pure loss for the economy, the fiscal strength and the ability of our people to defend themselves; 2. the disadvantages of German emigration cannot be set against a single direct advantage. Organized German emigration. At the general assembly of the German Colonial Association in 1886, the principle was recognized that the regulation of German emigration should be the responsibility of both the German imperial authorities and independent associations. This view was also supported and advocated by all renowned writers. Since for Germany it cannot be a question of state colonization, which by its nature would have to involve great expenditure at the expense of the German taxpayers, it is superfluous to discuss whether the mercantilists or the Smithians are right with their one-sided systems. For us, the emigration question is a national question, but especially a labor and capital question, in the solution of which the various factors in the state and economic life of our nation must participate according to the diversity of profession, task and interest, and will also participate in the natural development of the driving forces. The decisive factor is not the system, which is inflexible and persistent, but the needs of the whole, which must be thought of as changing and shifting according to the course of time. We must therefore examine which tasks in the practical solution of the emigration question are incumbent upon the Reich authorities, and what part falls to the free associations, always with a view to the needs of the nation, to the national and economic interests of the whole.*) *) In this regard, we also refer to the negotiations of the German Colonial Society on this subject. At the General Assembly of November 22, 1888, a resolution was adopted, which the Reichstag deputy Dr. Hammacher represented as speaker, with the following content: 1) It is in Germany's interest that German emigration turns to countries where, in addition to the prospect of good economic and intellectual advancement, the conditions for the preservation of the immigrants' German identity and their relations with Germany are most guaranteed. It is therefore to be deplored that the ministerial decree of November 3, 1859 for the Kingdom of Prussia has hindered and continues to hinder emigration to the southern provinces of Brazil (Rio Grande do Sul and St. Catharina), where experience has shown that these preconditions of an area suitable for the reception of Germans exist.
