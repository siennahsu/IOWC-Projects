The whole party would have been in danger of starvation. Through Gideon Visagie, the undersigned was given eleven cattle and twenty sheep for food and ten cattle from the bastards in Modderfontein, in the hope that we would suffice. The same Namaqua captain who had done it to the undersigned and murdered his Hottentots brought him three slaughtered oxen and four sheep with the excuse that his hunters had done it and that they had now fled. On my return at the new or New Year's Flufs, a Namaqua captain was found, named Noubelo, called Roode Mos by the Bastard Hottentots; this captain owns the country from the Gammoys to the Somijs or Kalbflufs, and this people is called Keij- kous or grofse Kou. This captain asked me whether it was true what the Godonsies had done to us, and whether they had murdered Hottentots of mine. I answered in the affirmative; then the said captain decided to fight the Godonsies; but I advised him against it, as it was forgiven them and I had in mind to travel there again. This Captain Roode Mos assured me that he would give me cover from his men if I should make the journey again and gave me four slaughter oxen as a present.  So we traveled from Modderfontein to Camiesberg from April 23rd to May 29th. Here, at Hermanus Engelbrecht, things almost went as badly as before, as we lost almost all the oxen due to drought and lack of water, as we only had water once in ten days of travel. If the good countryman Engelbrecht in Camiesberg, who had reported to us in advance, had not supported us with oxen and food for the journey, we would have suffered great hardship.  I traveled from Engelbrecht in advance to my place Zeekoevallij (Seekuhbthal) in twelve days with fresh oxen, so that I arrived there happily on zo. June I arrived there happily, with the loss of one hundred and forty oxen on my journey there and back.  Oliphantsrivier, June 21, 1792, Wm. van Reenen.  xl.  The Wanjamuesi. By Paul Reichard.  The Wanjamuesi (sing. Mjamuesi) form a large tribe in East Africa, which extends east of Tanganika over an area of land approximately the size of Bavaria. The lake forms the western border there. To the east it extends to the western border of Uhähä and Ugogo. To the north it extends as far as the Wawinza and Wassukuma tribes. The latter are also generally counted among the Wanjamuesi, but they only belong to them linguistically. According to their ancestry, physique, facial shape and expression, skin color, character and constitution, they are undoubtedly part of the Wagogo and Usagara peoples. They are joined in the south by the Wafipa. The Wanjamuesi include the Wa-


Page 247

kimbu in the Mgunda-mkali, bordering the Wasaturu to the north, and further north, bordering the Wassukuma and Wawinza, the Wajui and Wasumboa. Since Mirambo's appearance, the latter have been almost completely displaced by the latter and most of them have migrated to the Luapula and Katanga. Mirambo himself belonged to this tribe and not, as Ratzel says in his ethnology, to the Zulu. The Wawende live along the Tanganika. The Wakonongo are located to the north of the Wafıka and to the west of the Wahähä. From there to the north, also west of the Wahähä up to the Wa- kimbu, the Waguru. Enclosed by the aforementioned Wanjamuesi tribes are the Wanjanjembe, Wagunda and Wagalla. The Watusi who immigrated to Unjanjembe come from Urundi and do not belong to the Wanjamuesi either linguistically or by descent, and the Watuta, who have supported Mirambo many times, are immigrant Zulus. Wakimbu live in Mdaburu on the western border of Ngogo and this place no longer belongs to Ngogo. There I found the last remnants of a tribe related to the Watusi, approximately 2oo heads. The members of this tribe, who according to their tradition had migrated far from the west a long time ago, have retained their old customs and language. Unfortunately, their name has slipped my mind and records of them, like many other valuable things, have been lost to me.  In the Unjamuesi language, the name Usukuma means: land in the north. The Wasukuma adopted this name for the tribe, probably at a time when the Wanjamuesi were the most powerful, leading and conquering tribes in East Africa. It is a common phenomenon in Africa for weaker or subjugated tribes to adopt the customs, traditions and language of more powerful tribes, such as the Wagogo of the Maasai and, more recently, the Wahähä. The Wakimbu in Mdaburu have adopted the customs, language and weapons of the Wagogo and since 1880, with the gradual reoccupation of the Mgunda-mkali by the Wanjamuesi, they have reverted to their old ancestry and transformed themselves back into Wanjamuesi, while the Wagogo, who are now under severe pressure from all sides, have fallen into disrepute. The southern lands of the Unjamuesi region are called Ntakama. The word is not used as a tribal designation. The language of the Wanjamusi, the Kiunjamuesi or more correctly Kinjamuesi, is a Bantu language belonging to Kiswahili, i.e. a prefix language. It is much less conceptual than Kiswahili proper and is characterized by the lack of the third person, as the same terms are used for the second and third person. The language contains many nasal sounds, e.g. ng-gonhon (gun, weapon). When excited, a "sch" is often added to words. When pronouncing this


Page 248

sch, the tip of the tongue is placed lightly against the lower incisors so that it is hissed out as if by a person with a speech impediment. To give greater emphasis, the Mjamuesi adds a "hu" to the last word of the sentence with a sharply pronounced "h' e.g. waleka-waid-ja wakimakiduhu "don't let them escape, stab them down!" The Mjamuesi also have the habit of pronouncing soft consonants sharply when excited, e.g. "wakkimmakkittuhu mssunku" instead of wakimmakiduhu msungu "stab the European!" The battle cries are all pronounced in the fistula. All vowels are pronounced fully and very broadly, which gives the language something raw and mean. The "e'" as in "gehen" is missing completely, replaced by a pronounced ä& In Wakimbu, the k is guttural, a very rare phenomenon in the Bantu languages. Place names and conjugation are very precise in Kinjamuesi and the language is difficult to learn, even for the coastal Negroes. As with all Bantu languages, everything that is not descriptive, e.g. political topics, has to be discussed three or four times before an exact understanding is achieved that excludes all doubt, and this is the reason for the endlessly long and laborious negotiation and discussion of a topic.  The Wanjamuesi are genuine Bantuneg people, and the pure typical Mjamuesi can still be distinguished very clearly despite the multiple mixing with other tribes through imported slaves. The figure is slender, rather large than small with fine bones and fine joints. The position of the pelvis, which is so characteristic of Negroes, is not so noticeable in the Wanjamuesi. It is not tilted forward as much as in other Negro tribes, so that the upper body protrudes very little or almost not at all in front of the upper thighs and the buttocks, at least in the male, are hardly more protruding than in us. In the female, however, the buttocks are more prominent. Very peculiar is the frequent occurrence of unequally long or too short arms in the Wanjamuesi men, more so than in other tribes. In contrast, this phenomenon is rarely observed in females. Whether this is the case to a conspicuously higher degree in Europeans cannot be answered without further ado, as this can be concealed here. The occurrence of cripples is very rare. They are not killed but pitied, as it is assumed that they have been disfigured by sorcerers.  The skull is dolichocephalic and the prognathism of the Negro skull is often very noticeable. The eye sockets, on the other hand, are not so far apart and as a result the nasal bone between the eyes is less depressed and a narrow, often eagle-like curved fine nose could develop with fine


Page 249

movable wings. The face is also narrow and the temples are depressed, while the forehead is usually low. The hair grows deep into the forehead, especially in females. The cheekbones are less prominent and, in combination with the narrow lips and the shape of the nose, often give the face an Indian look, which is often enhanced by almond-shaped slit eyes. The eyebrows are well arched. The ears are usually small and slightly protruding. The pupil, which is often indistinctly visible, can just as easily evoke an expression of great stupidity as shining, piercing eyes with a continuous, shy gaze give the impression of great wildness or liveliness, the latter being heightened by great mobility of expression and lively gestures.  The bones are covered with a fine dry musculature, which stands out quite sharply. For all the work they perform, the muscles have something peculiarly rigid and firm, as if the limbs of a bronze statue were moving in their joints. The whole musculature gives the impression of great toughness and endurance, which is heightened by the very strongly developed pectoral muscles, but weakened again by the less developed calf and forearm muscles. The hands and feet of the Wanjamuesi are remarkably small and narrow and often beautifully shaped, especially the nails. Flat feet are much rarer than in our country.  The muscular strength of the Wanjamuesi is underdeveloped. The Negro is not able to suddenly concentrate his strength at a given moment. The will of his nerves to the muscles seems to be very slow, which is why a relatively weaker European can easily overpower a very muscular-looking Negro. However, when it comes to continuous feats of strength, such as carrying loads and working in the fields, the Mjamuesi is unsurpassable in performance and endurance and it often seems incomprehensible how such a slight figure, which apparently consists only of bones and skin with a few muscle pads underneath, is able to carry such heavy loads in the heat of the sun. This can only be explained by the fact that, in addition to muscular toughness, a kind of absent-mindedness makes the feat possible. If the Negro is deprived of this peculiar quality of being absent-minded when performing work, he is unfit for work, at least for that which is now required of him, for carrying loads and cultivating fields. Negroes from the coast, who are already more mentally alert, are therefore less able to carry out such work with perseverance.  The skin color is generally dark brown with shades of light coffee brown, but rarely, mostly in women,


Page 250

The color of the reddish-brown is a characteristic yellow undertone, which is common to all tribes with a fine muscular structure, dry, fine musculature and sharp features, in contrast to the red undertone, which always accompanies a coarse bone structure, roundish strong musculature and thick lips. These undertones can be regarded as specific characteristics of two large tribal groups.  The impression of a deep blue-black skin is only created in bright sunshine in dark specimens and the correct color gradation can only be judged at the onset of dusk. The inner palm and the sole of the foot are yellowish white to brownish, the nails pink. The lips, on the other hand, are usually slightly lighter than the skin, but "never" red. The armpit and hollow of the knee are also slightly lighter in color. The gums are brownish pink. The mucous membranes of the eyes are also slightly interspersed with pigment, as is the eyeball. As with all Negroes, the iris is dark brown, often too black after the pupil, so that it is often not possible to distinguish the border of the iris, resulting in a silly or stupid expression. It is very rare to find people with completely dark brown soles, palms and dark brown gums. This, like a very dark skin color in general, is then considered ugly; he is as black as Rufs or a coal, one then says derisively of such a black person. In any case, the sun has a very great effect on the coloration of the skin.  As with all Negroes, areas of skin that have been protected from the sun's rays by clothing for a longer period of time are significantly lighter in color than others that have been exposed to the sun. The difference in color is then usually much more significant, as in the sunburned face and the white chest of a European. This is very noticeable when a thick head of hair that has been worn for a long time is shaved off. Negroes brought to Europe always become many shades lighter. The skin itself, although completely exposed to the air, is very delicate, velvety, and takes on a grayish-pale color in the cold, as well as in death, so that it then looks as if it has been finely powdered with ashes, without losing its brown. A Negro corpse does not have the frightening horror of a white corpse for a long time. With age, the skin becomes very flabby, wrinkled and hangs in countless wrinkles on the flesh. Near Igonda, I had the opportunity to observe an albino. It was a girl about ten years old, dressed only in a small apron. The skin color was pink and without any pigment, the curled hair, eyebrows and eyelashes yellowish white. The light gray-brown eyes seemed quite normal, not red and blinking and yet somewhat sensitive to light. The child did not make the unan-


Page 251

impression of an albino. The Wanjamuesi claimed that it was the barstard of a European, but this was completely out of the question. The Wanjamuesi appear to be very rarely albino, but occasionally one finds flaxen skin in which areas the size of a dot or the palm of a hand appear completely pink on any part of the body. Such areas can even spread to the lips and mouth and soon become larger and then smaller. According to the Wanjamuesi, they are caused by cured syphilis (Kin. Rasuende) or by a rash-like disease called coma. Until now, blushing was regarded as an advantage of the white race, but I have observed that even the dark Negro blushes quite noticeably. The blushing is nothing more than a blood overfilling of the skin capillaries as a result of a nerve stimulus and why should this process not also take place in other colored races. In the Mjamuesi, as in all Negroes, the skin of the face turns red under the black pigment and the blood slants into the veins of the eyeball in particular, so that these look inflamed when they are highly embarrassed or agitated. I have never been able to prove the much-quoted bad smell of the Negro as a specific odor. There are Wanjamuesi, and this is the vast majority, which do not smell at all, and others, especially those with flat feet, which smell very strongly and foul, and one can observe such offensive nasal exhalations in our country, e.g. in factories, just as unpleasantly and perhaps to an even greater degree than with the Negro. The Mjamuesi is generally very clean and never misses an opportunity to wash and bathe. His soft, velvety skin exudes a lot of odor and, when clean, usually feels very cool. The Negro perspires extremely strongly when working. In rainy weather and in the cold months of May and June, he very often rubs his body with oil and this gives him a peculiar unpleasant odor, which, however, is by no means specific to him, as is clear from the nature of the matter. The Mgogo has a peculiar musty smell, which really gives the impression of a wild person, and this also comes from the special treatment of the skin and is often so strong that you can often smell a Mgogo coming under wind at a distance of a kilometer. However, this smell cannot be called a stench either. The Mgogo washes itself with human urine, then rinses its body with warm water, rubs it with ricinus or oil of earth and then decorates itself with red laterite. His skin is remarkably soft and fine, yet incredibly resistant to the harsh winds of his homeland. The hair of the Mjamuesi is evenly distributed on the head and often grows deep into the forehead, especially in women. They


Page 252

are always glossy black, very dense and curly. Beard growth is sparse and hair on the chest and back of males is very rare, if present it is also curly. Bald heads occur. The beard is usually shaved off. The hair in the armpits and on the genitals is always shaved off for reasons of cleanliness. The hair begins to turn gray between the ages of forty and fifty. However, one rarely sees completely white-headed people among the Wanjamuesi in contrast to the Negroes of the coasts.  Wanjamuesi men generally have a beautiful, even figure, and the dark color of their skin is a great advantage, as it does not allow large, unsightly areas to stand out as much as on white skin, and the many colorful skin reflexes bring more warmth to the figure and, above all, prevent the feeling of defenceless nakedness.  Manhood usually occurs between the ages of fourteen and sixteen, sometimes even earlier. It happens about three to five times out of a thousand that a man's pectoral muscles develop in a similar way to a woman's budding bosom, but this is always considered very embarrassing by the person concerned and is kept hidden by a cloth tied around his head. The Wan- jamuesi as well as the coastal Negroes therefore usually perform a peculiar operation at the onset of manhood, when the mammary glands are painful, by bending tough, finger-thick wood so that it serves as a kind of pincer to compress the painful mammary glands, whereby an extremely painful feeling gives the impression that the gland in question has burst. This is intended to prevent the breast-like growth of the pectoral muscles. Circumcision is not practiced among the Wanjamuesi.  The female is somewhat smaller than the male and has the same fine bone structure and delicate, often elegant forms, but always a broad face and very rarely a sharply curved nose. A characteristic difference is the more pronounced projection of the body parts compared to the male. Otherwise, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish an adult woman from a man when viewed from behind. Above all, she lacks a constricted belt and her hips are usually not as developed as a man's. If, as is often the case, a woman's thighs are curved outwards like a sabre, so that the position in relation to the lower thigh is similar to that of a man, it is often only the front view that can create certainty about the sex. The Wanja- muesi, like all the Negro tribes I have come to know, consider a woman without a constricted belt to be beautiful if her body is about the same width from the hips to under the arms, kama ngasi (like a ladder, says the coastal Negro), her neck must be long and thin "like a snake" and the neck must be long and thin "like a snake".


Page 253

the ears must be like an elephant, i.e. completely protruding and large. The chest has to be full and bursting. They don't like our women, and Maganga, my personal hunter, once gave me a funny description of an English lady he had seen in Zanzibar: "I saw a woman in Zanzibar; she had a lot of cloth fastened around her belly, like a Mrua (tribe in the upper Congo), but she wore most of the cloth gathered together at the back, whereas the Mrua wears it at the front. Her feet and hands were hidden in black and yellow sacks, and her whole body was covered in cloth. Her body was the most ugly part of her, her belly as thin as an insect, so that it could have been broken off without much effort. Her breasts were bound up so that she looked like a young girl. But that was just a lie, she was an old woman, quite old, despite her lie, I saw it. Her face was very white. On her head she had a ngalla (warrior's headdress) made of ostrich feathers, very high and made of beautiful feathers. (This seemed to interest Maganga the most, he shook with laughter). She wore earrings like our women and her crotch was like that of a man. I-icsch, Wasungu. But I don't want to have such a ugly woman with a belt like an insect." The breasts of young girls are full at most until the age of thirteen and begin to develop at the age of seven and eight. The base of the breast is smaller than that of our women and often the nipple with the areola forms an attachment on the breast, so that it sits on top of the first breast like a second breast. Menstruation occurs in the tenth to thirteenth year, usually in the thirteenth, and this event gives rise to great festivity, dancing, singing and beer drinking among the women. The now manly girl, whose virginity has always been lost, is now washed with herbal decoctions, rubbed with oil and finally splashed all over with flour water from the mouth of the fetish woman in the circle of the waganga (fetish women, sing. mganga) and must then give a test in front of all the women in the completion of certain movements in various positions. Men are not allowed in. As a result of the heavy workload, the married woman is between twenty and twenty-five years old and very changed. The breasts hang limp and smooth like bags on the abdomen, often down to the girdle, the features are ugly, wrinkles appear, the abdomen is strong, there is often a build-up of fat, as well as deterrent thinness, the buttocks are very full. The arms have become particularly strong and muscular from the constant pounding and rubbing of flour. The gait of the Wanjamuesi women is highly peculiar and unnatural. The completely inwardly turned feet


Page 254

are barely lifted from the ground, dragging, and with each step the person concerned sinks into the hips, with the face of the leg on which the body then rests being pushed completely outwards. The arms hang limply, as if paralyzed, dangling from the body and one shoulder is held higher and forward as if the other is pressed downwards by a heavy load. Since they never wear a bodice, the women breathe with their bellies like men.  The tribal insignia of the Wanjamuesi are tattooed and the teeth are mutilated. Using a small bundle of needles or thorns, stripes are engraved starting from the hair over the forehead to the tip of the nose and two or even just one stripe vertically over the temples up to the level of the auditory canal, the wounds, formerly with a herbal decoction, now rubbed with oblique powder, so that black two to three millimeter wide strokes are created there. The Wagalla also tattoo two concentric circles on the shoulders through closely spaced tangential incisions three to four millimetres long. These are not rubbed in with paint, but are only recognizable because the skin formed over the incisions becomes shiny. Tooth trimming consists of cutting off the inner corners of the upper central incisors, but not filing them, as is generally done. A small finger-length iron chisel, actually the miniature form of the Wanjamuesi axe, is used and splinters are gradually removed by striking with a small piece of wood. The procedure is said to be very painful in that it causes extremely severe headaches at the back of the head. Incidentally, the teeth are never affected later on, as the teeth of the blacks are usually excellent, which has much to do with their careful care. They rinse their mouths after every meal and often brush their teeth for hours by chewing finger-thick, tough-fibered wood and using the resulting brushes to brush their teeth. Ratzel mentions in his "Völkerkunde" B. I. p. 446 that the Wanjamuesi knock out their lower central incisors, which is by no means the case, but is a tribal characteristic of certain Manjuema and all Wama tribes.  For reasons of expediency, the Wanjamuesi practice polygamy in order to gain more labor. Most of them have only one wife. The bridegroom pays an agreed sum to the bride's father or, if he is no longer alive, to the uncle, i.e. the mother's brother, either in exchangeable goods or in cattle, small livestock and iron hoes. However, this does not mean that the bride has become the property, i.e. not the groom's slave. Divorce can always be brought about by the chief if there are sufficient grounds,


Page 255

z. For example, if the woman does not have children, because of adultery, because of syphilis or if the two cannot get along, or if the woman maliciously betrays the man. In all cases, however, whether the man or the woman is at fault, the bridewealth must be returned to the man. Most people marry only one wife, but many marry a second when the first has grown old and has lost her health. Then, even if more are married, the first one always takes the highest place and is preferred everywhere, and is usually the most trusted.  In the case of betrothals, the uncle has a consultative voice alongside the father, i.e. the mother's brother, not the father's brother. This position of the uncle, the mother's brother, is a clear indication of an earlier material relationship in Africa and we will find more traces of this later. Marriages between siblings and children of blood brothers, as well as with the wife of a blood brother, are regarded as blood disgrace and, like sorcery, are usually punished with the death penalty. Likewise, sexual relations between siblings and between parents and children. It is noteworthy that this law is quite strictly enforced.  The wedding is celebrated as a great feast. After the bridewealth has been paid after endless negotiations, the women of the village fetch the bride from her parents' hut and carry her to the groom's hut, singing as they parade around the village. A mganga (medicine man) binds two pieces of wood, each one to two millimetres thick and three to five millimetres long, to the foreheads of the two men using a string. The pieces of wood are usually spun together with fine wire to form a whole. Both are then dressed in festive attire and sprinkled all over with flour water, which the medicine man sprays through his mouth. The guests are pelted with sorghum grains and served pombe and the whole day is spent with the women dancing. The bride only takes part once or twice and, like the groom, is forced to dance the round dance with the women. Men never take part in the women's dance. The groom must give a small gift to the lead singer. Only in the evening does the bride belong to the man. Marriages are contracted between free men, between free men and slaves and between slaves, in the latter case the bridewealth is to be paid to the master. In the case of separation, which can be brought about by the will of the master, the bridewealth must also be returned. The Wanjamuesi know that the pregnancy lasts g9 months. The Wanjamuesi women are no more fertile than other Negro women; they are likely to bear two to three, at most four children. During childbirth, which is almost always very easy - one very rarely hears of


Page 256

In the event of death, old, experienced women assist and the placenta is buried. Men are not allowed to be present and are expelled from the vicinity. They are very clumsy in the treatment of the navel and so often large umbilical hernias occur, in that the emerging navel often becomes as large as a woman's breast I have observed this more often in women than in men, and they sometimes look as if they have three breasts. Children are known to be red at birth, like our newborns with a slight brownish tinge, or reddish-pink, yellowish-pink. The sole and inner palm are completely white, like ours, the genitals of a male newborn, the lips, navel and nipples of both sexes are brown. The skin then begins to darken in patches after a few days and the child is only completely tanned after six to eight weeks.  The newborn is washed off immediately after birth and hung with a cord which runs over one shoulder under the other arm. Often two such strings are hung crosswise. All kinds of fruit with a woody skin, animal claws and pieces of wood are attached to it as a charm. The first hair of the Negro child is plain and brownish, but soon falls out or is shaved off to make way for curly hair. Children who are born with teeth (Kis. Kigägo) are killed immediately, otherwise they bring misfortune and disaster. Two to three days after the birth, at which time the young mother rises to sit on one of the low stools in the sun, the infant is fed with a thin flour porridge. The mother places the child on the stool, holds the cupped hand to its mouth and with the other hand fills the cupped hand full of porridge so that the mouth and nostrils are completely flooded and the child has to swallow if it does not want to choke. The children of the Wanjamuesi, like those of all Negroes, are quite charming up to the third and fourth year, as the blunt little nose looks good on a small child.  The Wanjamuesi have a disproportionately high number of twin births, more than other tribes, as I was generally assured. Twins also play a major role among them, they are called Mpassa. When they are born, the parents have to pay tribute to the village elder and the chief of the country, usually a hoe or small livestock. Old women then wander around the village and the surrounding villages collecting gifts for the twins, beads, scraps of cloth or grain, and here and there they even receive a chicken. They appear with a few cattle-box lids, which they beat on slowly like an iron hoe and sing a ghoulish song, the lyrics of which always glorify the sexual parts of the man and the woman.


Page 257

The twins are the culmination of a woman's life and are therefore of the most obscene nature imaginable. Two small fetish huts are immediately built for the twins in front of the house of the woman who has recently given birth, and sacrifices are made for them on every suitable or unsuitable occasion. Especially when someone is ill or wants to travel or go to war. If a twin wants to cross a water, stream, river or lake, he must take a mouthful of water and sprinkle it over the surface of the water, then say: nänä mpassa (I am a twin), likewise if he gets caught in a storm on a lake, for example. If he fails to do this, disaster can easily befall him and his companions. If one or both twins die, two alo& are planted next to the small fetish hut at the birth hut.  Among the Wanjamuesi there are very few women who do not suckle their children themselves; despite their sensuality, they often abstain from all sexual intercourse with the man for up to a year. The child is suckled for two or even three years, often together with the nextborn. The mother keeps it very clean, washes it several times a day with warm water and then rubs it with oil. Despite the fact that the babies are not wrapped in swaddling cords, they thrive quite well and it is very rare to see hunchbacks, people with crooked legs or compressed chests. However, many may perish from other unreasonable treatment. For example, babies are given pombe to drink eight days after birth. The survivors are all the healthier, and infirmity and disease are not seen to the same extent as here.  The mother always carries the completely naked child on her back and finds it a natural place to rest on the protruding frame. It is held in place by a fur or bark cloth. This fabric or the hide is either tied over one shoulder or wrapped around the chest under the arms so that the weight of the child itself prevents the knot from coming undone. With very small children only the head is untied, with larger children the arms are untied. The little ones' bare fists peek out on both sides of the hips. The child remains there throughout the day and sleeps despite the violent vibrations to which it is exposed during the mother's work, despite the blazing sun that burns down on the completely unprotected head, despite the countless flies that sit in dense swarms around the eyes, nose and mouth to feed on the saliva, mucus or eye discharge that escapes, even the evening dance is unable to rob the child of either mood or sleep.  The Negro children have one outstanding characteristic that sets them apart from our children in the most advantageous way: they cry very little. 


Page 258

The parents, together with the uncle, choose a name for the child, which is usually called by the father's name, or if it was born out of wedlock, by the mother's name, with the addition of Mana=child, e.g. Manahuaia the child of Huaia, Mana- kasinde the child of Kasinde. There are no special male and female names. Later, people often give themselves a completely different name, which indicates a deed, a characteristic or the appearance of the person concerned. For example, one called himself Fingamaguha = bone collector (Kin. Rufinga collect, maguha the bones) because he had the idea of tying a bone in his hair from every chicken he ate. Another was called Mpanda malalä the field-crusher or devastator, because he ran across the fields as a brave warrior and devastated them. Mirambo the Strong, the famous chieftain of Inner East Africa, was so called because he forced everyone to do the same. An abnormal birth also gives rise to names, e.g. Kasinde, the one born with the feet first. There are no actual names in the Mjamuesi language, they all mean something and are mostly words that are used very frequently.  Incidentally, the Wanjamuesi almost always address each other as mid-chane, companion, friend, and so it happens that one of them forgets his name completely and has to be reminded of it by his companion. Very often they also forget their original name completely, as they are given a different one, e.g. Mtomba nsilla = the one who mingles with the path, i.e. one who is always traveling. Similarly, the Ruga Ruga (warrior) as such takes on a name. At home, those concerned are not addressed by these names. These names are also often changed, so that some people no longer know what they are actually called; this is why it is very difficult to find out the correct name from people. The upbringing of the children is the least of the Wanjamuesi's worries. The father does not worry about it at all and the mother only as far as nature requires until the child can walk and no longer needs the breast. The Wanjamuesi mothers have a different view of the latter than we do, as they often still give their children the breast in their third year.  In their youth, the children enjoy an enviable freedom in that they can do as they please, completely left to their own devices. As a result, the Wanjamuesi children, like those of all other tribes, are distinguished from our children by their astonishing precociousness and ridiculous blasé nature. As soon as they are past the earliest helpless infancy, they no longer have any of the charming, beautiful childishness. They know everything that the adults


Page 259

The children who grow up know and, according to us, have no naivety at all. The Negro, on the other hand, remains childish until the very end of his life. One might think that with the complete lack of education and supervision on the part of the parents, the children might become very naughty, but this is by no means the case; I have never noticed any actions on their part that seemed particularly worthy of punishment. The freedom they enjoy to such an enviable degree seems to have a calming effect on their minds, and since they are actually already mature at the age of seven and eight, they are not really familiar with the teasing that is so popular with our children, they are already too blasé. It is this early maturity that usually causes such great difficulties in the civilization of the Negro, a moment to which very little attention has yet been paid. However, since the Negroes have grown up in the same way for many millennia, precocity is hereditary and it will take many generations for the Negro brain to remain as malleable during adolescence as ours is in youth. The Negro children never play like our children, they are not able to immerse themselves in play in such a way that the world does not exist for them for hours on end. They have no stimulation and too much time on their hands.  This phenomenon is most noticeable in boys. They are content to carve a small bow here and there, and a bundle of broken, thick straws serves as arrows, which they then drag around all day without making a mess of it. Mostly they loiter around idly, or they roam in the field, looking for everything and nothing. Occasionally one of the boys takes it upon himself to carve a better little bow and try to shoot birds with really small arrows; it is one of the rarest of rarities for boys to practise shooting at a banana stalk. Once they start a war game, they soon stop again, bored, and if some of them get into a fight, adults immediately jump in to prevent many a quarrel, because every drop of blood that would appear would be used by the parents to demand compensation. Likewise, all loud frolicking and wild running around by adults is prevented and thus a certain communist education is practiced in this direction. During my long stay among the Wanjamuesi, I only saw boys playing a game once. They had made small loads out of sticks and grass and imitated a caravan, Kin. lugendo (literally steps). Twice only did I observe them building tiny huts out of brushwood and clay, and here and there they loaded long reeds with sand or ashes and then blew them out, imitating gunpowder smoke. The only game with which the boys often amuse themselves is a ball- Zeitschr, d. Gesellsch, f. Erdk, vol. XXIV. 18
