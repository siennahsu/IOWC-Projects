A word from the Emperor. At the lunch given in honor of His Majesty the Emperor on March 5 by the Provincial Diet of the Province of Brandenburg, the Emperor gave a speech that was received with enthusiastic applause and was significant in every respect, in which he spoke the following words from the soul of every colonial friend, referring to the activities of the Great Elector: "In my room hangs a picture that had long been forgotten; it shows a row of proud ships, the red eagle of Brandenburg in the flag. This picture reminds me daily of how the Great Elector already had the correct insight that Brandenburg had to conquer a position in the world market in order to utilize its diligence and manpower. The progress that Prussia and Germany's trade and commerce have made since that time has been great, especially under My Lord Grandfather's government. I consider promoting the further flourishing of our economic activity to be one of my most noble tasks; I have therefore turned my attention inwards, after my activities were initially aimed at securing peace on the outside."
What the great ancestor expressed as a principle and tirelessly pursued until the end of his life: "Seafaring and trade are the noblest pillars of an estate, through which the subjects obtain their food and sustenance both by sea and by the Manufaktum on land, continues to have a driving force in the grandson and fills us with the joyful confidence that the great work of German colonization that has begun will be eagerly promoted by the highest authority. Two hundred years ago, the self-satisfied complacency, the philistine pusillanimity, the spirit of particularism, the Privy Councils, the envious states of Kurbrandenburg, which were on the rise, opposed the undertakings of the Great Elector as "some obstacula"; today the tide has turned for the better, but nevertheless large masses of the German people are still indifferent, if not hostile, to colonial policy, and the opposition of foreign countries persecutes us in almost all of our colonies. Under the protection and umbrella of our Emperor, however, in the splendour of the new German Empire, we are certain to triumph and also to fulfil the world-historical mission in the field of colonization in overseas countries which Providence intended for us at the end of the nineteenth century.

The Arab question and Emin Pasha. When the German cultural beginnings in East Africa were destroyed by the Arab uprising, it became necessary to return the colony to its original purpose by force of arms. Only gradually, therefore, will the colonial politicians be able to return to a peaceful course and deal with matters concerning both the future constitutional status of the protectorates and the attitude of the government and society towards the Arabs. We would like to draw the attention of our readers to the importance of the latter matter in particular. One of the faults of recent German cultural endeavors was probably that too little attention was paid to the Arab element, which was thought to be easily dealt with, although it had gained a powerful influence on the education of the natives, both good and bad, through centuries of presence on the coast. Even though the pure Arabs were few in number compared to the masses of Swahili and natives, they led the country, especially in the coastal areas, as rulers who could see with satisfaction and pride how their law, their customs and their religion spread more and more. In his view, the acquisition of the hinterland by the Germans did little to change the situation in and of itself for the time being; the stations were too isolated, even if they were correctly laid out from a commercial and political point of view. It cannot be assumed, however, that he saw them as the expression of a systematic approach, especially as their scattered location meant that they were of little relevance to the greater whole. The Arab element only became generally uneasy when the agreements of the Sultan of Zanzibar's treaty with the East African Company became known and a section of the Arabs felt threatened in good faith in everything that had been sacred and dear to them. A longer period of administration by the Germans would have shown him that he had nothing to fear, but all sorts of adverse circumstances came together to hasten the outbreak of revolt, which grew more bitter from day to day, and had to be quelled by force of arms. As there was little sign of religious fanaticism, the cause of the revolt must be sought in the feeling of the Arabs that their political and commercial power would come to an end if the Germans established themselves on the coast. As far as the exercise of political power is concerned, it is self-evident that after the events of the last few years the Arabs have lost all prospect of it, and as far as their trade relations are concerned, the whole of them, and not just a tiny number who have grasped the new era, would certainly do well to join the well-funded Germans and emancipate themselves from the Indians. In this respect a gradual change will undoubtedly take place the stronger our military and commercial power becomes. Nevertheless, it remains necessary for us to gradually accustom the Arab and Arabized coastal population to the fact that, even if some of their prerogatives are taken away, they can continue to live quietly under German rule according to their old laws and traditional customs, as long as they are not absolutely hostile to European views, such as in the question of the slave trade. This peaceful side of our activities in East Africa is just as difficult as the warlike side, and it requires a great deal of tact and familiarity with Islamic law and its legal concepts if mistakes are to be avoided here. Other nations that rule over Muhammadans have also taken great pains to penetrate the legal relationships of their subjects. The English in the East Indies, the French in Algiers and the Senegal, the Dutch in the Dutch Indies have made important preparations, and recently Austria-Hungary has also had to merge Turkish and Occidental law in Bosnia and Herzegovina for the purposes of administration, so that both Christians and Mohammedans can live contentedly under Austrian rule. The situation in the coastal area of the Sultan of Zanzibar, as created by the treaty of 1888, left the appointment of subordinate judges to the German East African Society, subject to the Sultan's approval, to cite just one example, whereas the "Kadi" was to be appointed by the Sultan. The Kadi is therefore the most important judicial personality. The Islamic judicial system is in itself very simple; in the Ottoman Empire, the kadis decide all civil and criminal cases as single judges without exception and without the possibility of appeal. The laws contain very detailed regulations on the personal and formal qualifications of the Kadi, who also has to make decisions in matters of faith and ritual, so that the Kadi must indeed be regarded as a scientifically educated judge.1) It is self-evident that he only knows and acts in accordance with Islamic law, and it is equally clear that he has it in his power to cause us all kinds of inconvenience. And yet Islamic law is very sophisticated and differs from European law in many respects! Although there is no objection to the transfer of jurisdiction over the natives to their own authorities, wherever this is the case, and this relationship is natural and recommendable, it will nevertheless become necessary over time for the state to at least penetrate into the essence of this jurisdiction, if it should not prefer to introduce certain new concepts into the system of rights in highly developed conditions such as those in East Africa. It is obvious that this has its enormous difficulties, because only those who know the Qur'an and the currents in the Muslim world are able to find the middle way here, especially since Islamic law is not ossified, but is constantly evolving. It will be objected that the form of jurisdiction is fixed by contract and that unilateral changes cannot be made. We also do not believe that existing legal systems should be overturned with a clumsy hand, but we consider it appropriate, in order to avoid later abuses and costly attempts, to exert a great influence on the administration of justice if we do not wish to remain strangers in the country. Some would like to see him used as the leader of an expedition to Wadelai, others to Uganda or to Tabora and Langanyika for the increasingly urgent securing of the German sphere of interest, but all are united in the wish that this invaluable force can be won over for German colonial policy. Nothing has yet been said about the intentions of the government, which is apparently negotiating with him, and we do not know whether they want to use him, the victor over the Mahdists, for warlike purposes or whether they want to utilize his incomparable administrative skills and his deep knowledge of the Islamic world for peaceful purposes. He should be most welcome to us in any activity! But if we have now touched on another aspect of our future task in East Africa, it is in the conviction that there is still important cultural work awaiting us here. Emin's intermediate position as a Turk and European in the Aquatorial Province has contributed in the best possible way to balancing out existing differences, his sense of research has driven him to penetrate the individuality of the various tribes, to learn their different languages and dialects, his knowledge of the Arabic language and his position have enabled him to familiarize himself with the way of thinking of Islam. "In his administration," writes Robert William Felkin 3), "Emin spared no effort to familiarize himself intimately with all matters that arose. The diligence and zeal with which he applied himself to all his duties were unequaled, and it was the highest aim of his endeavor to act as a perfectly impartial judge. In criminal cases, he carefully avoided limiting the defendant's defense, but it was not easy to deceive him with excuses and lies. As good-natured as he was, he never wavered in his execution once he had made a firm decision... The work he has done and the successes he has had must be recognized by all unprejudiced observers." ¹) We refer those who are interested in the subject to the work of Professor Dr. Kohler "Rechtsvergleichende Studien über islamitisches Recht, das Recht der Berber, das chinesische Recht und das Hecht auf Ceylon" (Carl Heymanns Verlag, Berlin), in which a wealth of material is brought together and legally processed. *) The daily newspapers disagree as to which of them first pointed out the necessity of securing the German sphere of interest in East Africa. Let us note that L'Afrique, in its No. 2 of February 1890, in a long essay on the Anglo-Portuguese conflict, after describing the first appearance of the British-South African Company project, writes:... "Whatever the case may have been, the Deutsche Kolonialzeitung did not hesitate to draw the attention of the German Foreign Office to the project mentioned by the Times ... See the article "Englische Bestrebungen in Zentralafrika" in No. 23 of June 8, 1889 and "Die britisch ostafrikanisch Gesellschaft" in No. 22 of June 2, 1888. Since then, we have repeatedly and convincingly explained the importance of proceeding towards the lakes. German Review. Published by Richard Fleischer. March. Breslau and Berlin.

Of what importance would this personality, in the service of the Imperial Government, be for the development of our East African territory? The significance of Tabora for German East Africa. By Paul Reichard. Tabora, the main trading and staging post of the Arabs in East Africa, which lies between the 3° f. B. and 33° E. L., is by no means a town as we understand it and gives Nealing the impression of great disappointment at first sight, an impression that is only lessened by the long march from the coast, as only small towns, villages and spots with a maximum of 2,300 inhabitants are passed on the entire journey. It would be a completely futile attempt to even approximately determine the number of inhabitants in Tabora, as the population is constantly flowing in and out. Tabora consists of a not too large complex of Arab farmsteads, which are scattered around irregularly. Only a small number of them are inhabited all year round. Just over 20 Arabs with slaves have a permanent residence there. Tabora lies in a very flat, very wide hollow, surrounded by low hills 50-80 meters high, which largely penetrate the area of Unjanjembe. Tabora itself is not fortified, which is not possible given the way it is built, with farmsteads mostly scattered around. From a distance, only one of the gray Arab houses with flat roofs can be seen here and there, shining out of the green eughorbia hedges. The individual farmsteads, Tembe of the Arabs, are also built with little defensive capability, so that from a strategic point of view Tabora is of no significance at all and must be described as an open space. The immediate surroundings of Tabora are extremely populated for a radius of 3-4 hours and one encounters a Wanjamuesi or Maturi settlement at least every quarter to half an hour's walk and Arab farmsteads further out, none of which are fortified either. All the larger complexes of homesteads or larger villages have special names. The Quikuru, the residence of Chief Sike of Unjanjembe, however, is well fortified with a so-called Ipuri, a building 1/2 man high and 3-4 meters wide, made of mud, logs and a flat moss-covered roof, enclosing the village. A maximum of 4-500 people live in this quikuru, which is situated in a very flat area, and this is also where the Arab governor used to live. Since the death of the last governor, Abdalla bin Nasib, who died in 1882, the Sultan of Zanzibar has no longer appointed one. The Arab settlement in Unjanjembe was founded about 70 to 80 years ago and was formerly known as Kash or Ikaseh, a place which has now disappeared from the face of the earth without a trace. The Arabs' choice of location for the settlement depended more on the abundance of water found in the hollows, as the often slightly marshy soil was attractive for growing rice and barley. There were hardly any other reasons and the then living chief Fundikira would have been just as happy to give permission to settle in other nearby places. However, the fact that the Arabs settled in the land of Unjanjembe, where Tabora is located, was no coincidence. The way there had long been paved for them by the Wanjamuesi, the people who, among other vast territories, also inhabited Unjanjembe and had been moving to the coast every year for a long time, at least 100 years, to sell ivory and slaves to the Arabs. However, the situation later changed completely when the Arabs began to penetrate into the interior and took over the trade. They followed the Wanjamnesi road from Saadani and Dar=es Salaam, and only later did Bagamoyo become the caravan departure point on the coast, via Muapua through Ugogo and the Mgunda Mkali to Unjanjembe. However, as this country was still sparsely populated at that time, the road soon turned directly to the place where today's Tabora is located. At that time, there were still many elephants in Unjamuesi and the Wanjanjembe, the inhabitants of Unjanjembe, were particularly keen and skilled element hunters. They were also keen farmers, and this last circumstance made it possible for the Arabs to settle in Unjanjembe. Since the Wanjam uesi were passionate about the carrier trade and were just as happy to migrate to the coast as to all directions in the interior, the Arabs had all the most favorable conditions imaginable for their undertakings and for the settlement to flourish: a fertile region, populated by an eagerly farming tribe, which at the same time provided unsurpassed carrier material. In addition to all these favorable circumstances, the Wanjamnesi states had a fairly solid structure, for the Wanjamuesi are also quite capable warriors. When the coastal areas were no longer able to supply enough slaves after the introduction of the clove culture in Zanzibar, the first impetus was given to move to Tabora. The increasingly flourishing ivory trade around that time caused the economic boom of Tabora, which reached its peak in 1863 when the British enforced the restriction of the import of slaves and the prohibition of the slave market in Zanzibar on the Sultan Seyid Madrid in Zanzibar. These measures completely destroyed Zanzibar, i.e. the extensive plantations there, and the slave traders, so that the capital-owning Arabs, who had been engaged in plantation farming or were slave traders, set off for Tabora and bought ivory there for their own account. The lucrative business they made with their own capital caused more and more Arabs to go there, so that the ivory and slave trade was completely taken away from the natives and they only came to the coast as porters. That time, towards the middle of the sixties, was the time of economic splendor for Tabora. But it was not to stay that way for long. Among the increasing number of Arabs who appeared in Tabora, there were more and more who, without capital of their own, borrowed it from Indians at enormous usurious interest rates and who were thus in most cases unable to meet their obligations because of the high interest rates or who were unable to resist the temptations of a lavish life there, especially since the very arduous journey there easily led to compensation for living expenses. These people soon formed a large proletariat. They could no longer return to the coast as they were unable to pay off their debts without risking imprisonment in Zanzibar and preferred to gradually pay off their debts from Tabora through laborious small-scale trade or to remain in Tabora as small-scale farmers. When the elephants around Tabora were as good as wiped out, the Arabs had to undertake more and more trading trips, to Victoria Nyanka, to Karagwe and Uganda, near Ugunda in the south, on to Ukonongo, Usipa, Uemba at the southern end of the Tanganyika, or to Katanga. Others crossed the Langanyika near Kirandu to Marungu and Itaua. The Arabs founded a main settlement in Ujiji on the Langanyika and later went from there across the lake to Manjuema, where they founded Nyangwe and more recently settled in the middle Congo. What we saw for Zanzibar was now repeated for Tabora. The indebted Arabs in Tabora now borrowed goods from their compatriots there and for the second time a large number of them were unable to meet their debts. These debtors escaped their creditors to Ujili and the Congo. Tabora's political flourishing dates from that time, for most of the Arabs who had settled there were pretty much detached from any connection with the coast and formed an almost completely independent political power. The power of the Arabs in Tabora had become increasingly important from about 1860 onwards. But in Unjanjembe to the south, to the north and east, in Ugago, their influence was still quite insignificant, the more so in Ujili and the Congo. From the south, the Congo and Tanganyika, and the Victoria Nyanza, all ivory now flowed to Tabora and from then on it took on the character of a staple place, which it has retained to this day. Either Arabs came from the coast to buy the ivory in Tabora or some large and rich Arabs, who had definitely settled in Tabora, bought ivory and sent it to the coast. The importance of Tabora for the Arabs is, as can easily be seen, quite incalculable. Tabora is the base for all their undertakings in the interior, for it is from there that those further inland are supplied with everything that constitutes their condition of life and makes possible the expansion of their power, namely with barter goods, weapons and ammunition In addition, there is another circumstance of great importance, namely that the porters, who make the whole trade possible, as already mentioned, come from Unjamuesi and, as very eager farmers, remain in their villages in the months of November, December, January, February, March and April in order to cultivate the fields. The

Trade trains, which take place in the remaining months, and therefore one can only recruit porters from the coast as far as Tabora, because no Mjamuesi travel beyond Tabora, whether the caravan is led from the coast to the interior or continues from Tabora to the interior and returns there. The traders are therefore forced under all circumstances to recruit new porters in Tabora and to stay there for a while. It is so easy to see that all circumstances and relationships in East Africa, no matter which way you look at them, always inevitably point to Tabora, not only for the Arabs, but also for the natives, who, if the Arabs do not visit them on smaller trading trips, are forced to exchange their need for cloth, beads, wire, guns and powder in Tabora for their products and ivory. This is why all the natives' routes point to Tabora. It can therefore be said that after Zanzibar, Tabora is of great importance for East Africa, and that even Zanzibar's power is retroactively increased by Tabora. The traders in Sausibar are just as dependent on Tabora as the Arabs on the Victoria Nyanza, the Tanganyika and most of all the Congo. The Congo=Arabs can only turn their eyes away from Tabora and lead their trade relations down the Congo by giving up their own character and independence. However, the entire power of the Arabs on the east coast is not based on the Arabs themselves, as they are numerically too weak for this, but on the natives, partly directly, where they have subjugated them, and partly indirectly, by obtaining their slaves from these natives. In all respects, therefore, Tabora proves to be of eminent importance. Tabora is the East African chartum. One can say that the whole of Central Africa belongs to those who own Tabora; its influence is felt even as far as the Sudan. If the German imperial government is now determined to hold East Africa, i.e. to transfer its borders definitively to Tanganyika, circumstances make it imperative that we establish ourselves in Tabora. The objection that we have acquired enough land for the time being can only be raised by those who either have no knowledge of the circumstances or are fundamentally opposed to a further expansion of our influence. The seizure of Tabora is for the moment even more important than the subjugation of the southern provinces of German East Africa. I am even convinced that the occupation of Tabora would change the situation on the east coast at a stroke. It will make a tremendous moral impression on all those involved on the opposing side, i.e. the Arabs and the natives, and most importantly, it will not only completely paralyze the Arabs in Zanzibar, but will also put an early end to the uprising and place the Arabs in the interior entirely in our hands. We will get all Arab trade into our hands, and therein lies the great economic importance of Tabora for us, and the Sultan of Zanzibar would be forced, for better or worse, to give in to us on all points. The seizure of Tabora would also have an influence on England, on the one hand she would have to recognize Langanyika as the western border of German Africa, on the other hand her influence on the Sultan of Zanzibar would be much less. The seizure of Tabora should not prove too difficult. An army of 7-800, at most 900 well-armed and equipped troops will not be able to put up much resistance anywhere. The march would have to follow the well-trodden caravan routes via Muapua, through Ugago, the Mgundamkali, to Tabora. In Tabora itself, however, one would have to reckon with perhaps quite determined resistance from the Arabs. In such a case, it would be advisable to move the base of operations to Ugunda to the south, a country whose inhabitants would undoubtedly be on the German side, partly due to the successes I myself have achieved there and partly due to Wißmann's treatment of the Wanjamuesi, who have supported him in his battles. How good the prospects are for the seizure of Unjanjembe and Tabora can be seen from the fact that the chief of the country of Ungunda, named Adischa, which by the way belongs to me according to the law there and in which the supremacy over the chief of his time has also passed into my hands, won a brilliant victory over the chief Sike of Unjanjembe in 1888, so that the Arabs there got into the greatest distress and had to mediate peace. The economic conditions of Tabora will have the same significance for us in the future as they do now for the Arabs, since the great fertility of the land (great by local standards), its central location, which results in the confluence of all products from the lake regions, the strong population, the tenacious adherence of the Negroes to ways once recognized as practical, all work together. From a political point of view, Tabora is the only point from which it will be possible for us to develop power. It would be a very big mistake to choose any other place as a base, e.g. Ujiji or even Karema at Langanyika. The latter place is, by the way, the most unfavorable of the whole lake, without a harbor, away from all caravan routes, in a sparsely populated area, and extremely unhealthy. In the event that we build a railroad into the interior, which is only a matter of time, it must be led from Dares=Salaam, as the harbor, via Muapua to Tabora; another line, for example directly to Nyaffa, would be decidedly less recommendable. However, it is not within the scope of this discussion to discuss this. Under all circumstances, however, the Imperial Government should not hesitate a moment longer to undertake a major expedition to Tabora. It is high time, especially in view of the fact that Emin's withdrawal from the Wadelai will give the Arabs unlimited influence in the interior, which can only be counterbalanced by the establishment of a German military state, which would at the same time make our influence in the whole of East Africa unlimited. This would also put a stop to the English appetite for the Leen. Without a hinterland, German East Africa is almost worthless as a trading colony, and all sacrifices of human life and money would be sacrificed without equivalent.
The transportation of freed slaves. (Conclusion.) According to Reichard, a station with 150-300 freed slaves would require an investment capital of 200,000 marks with a reserve fund of 10,000 marks, which, however, would only have the prospect of earning interest in the third year. As far as the question of location is concerned, we note from the outset that it will not be possible to find a site that combines all the desirable characteristics for our purpose. The soil should be as productive as possible and the climate such that it allows the white man to live there for many years without interruption; a location is desirable which provides a certain degree of security not only against raids but also against all unsettling and demoralizing influences from outside, which, on the other hand, makes it difficult for our pupils to run away in the first few years and for them later to exchange agriculture for trade. In terms of the colony's profitability, on the other hand, it would be good if the transportation of its products to the world market did not cause too many difficulties. As you can see, it is in the nature of these conditions themselves that they are to some extent mutually exclusive, and we shall be satisfied if we find them united somewhere only in the majority. The immediate vicinity of the coast would have the advantage that the difficulties and costs of transportation, which a station in the interior incurs both in its establishment and in the export of its products, would be eliminated. Moreover, in the event of any danger from external enemies, we could count on the rapid protection of our warships. But this exhausts the advantages of the coastal region. Its climatic conditions are on the whole of such a nature - even the vaunted climate of Tanga is only a relatively good one - that we cannot hope to see the command in one and the same hands for a long series of years. And that is a very important point. But it would be almost as bad if the governor had to make frequent recreational trips. Secondly, on the coast we would be in the immediate neighborhood of the Arabs with their slave economy and their whole nature, which is contrary to a found culture. We must try to avoid contact with them as far as possible for the pupils of our colony. The closer we finally stay to the coast, the greater the danger of escaping, the greater the temptation to run away after the expiry of the colony ¹) Abridged reprint of a memorandum written on behalf of Commission V of the German Colonial Society.

the apprenticeship period, which was suggested above, to turn to small trade. If you want to avoid all these abuses - which are probably the most worrying - it is necessary to look around at a considerable distance from the coast. We have been thinking for some time about Usagaraland, especially the area of Mpuapua. It is highly praised both in the missionary reports, as is well known, the English church mission had gained a firm foothold here, and occasionally in the Blue Papers, and other reports agree with this: the climate is relatively cool, there is plenty of clean water and the soil is fertile. Although in 1887, according to the estimate of a missionary, one to two hundred slave caravans passed Muapua on the road leading to the coast, which is said to be one of the most direct and best in East Africa, there is no sign of actual slave hunts in the immediate vicinity, the neighboring tribes are peaceful (apart from the predatory Wahehe in the south) and the German officials in Muapua have, according to the report of an English missionary, gained popularity and reputation. On the other hand, there are also reservations about this region. Recent events have shown that a rebellion originating on the coast can exert its pernicious effects as far as here, and the possibility that the more the Tanganyika regions are exhausted, the further east the slave hunts will move is by no means excluded. We are indebted to Dr. Bokemeyer for pointing out a completely different region where these abuses are also likely to disappear: Dschaggaland on Kilimanjaro. We confess to having approached a study of the literature on Kilimanjaro and its surroundings with decided mistrust, as we had estimated the danger posed by the neighboring Maasai to be far too high and the quality of the climate and soil somewhat too low. But a careful consideration of the whole situation makes this point in East Africa appear particularly suitable in various respects. As far as the Maasai are concerned, who border on Djaggaland in the south and west, the predatory character of this nomadic people is emphasized in all reports: they attack defenceless tribes in the neighbourhood on their travels, whereby they are particularly interested in the capture of cattle; Europeans who have ventured into their territory have not exactly fared well either. But Dschaggaland, which is very protected by nature, has hardly suffered from them for years; similarly, the inhabitants of Taweta on the south-eastern slope of Kilimanjaro have not been bothered by the Maasai since they once vigorously fought them off. Also, none of the travelers whose reports are available to us have been harassed by Maasai either on the way to Kilimanjaro or on the return journey to the coast. Johnston's information on the Maasai (p. 383. 400. 508) is very instructive: "The relations of the farming tribes living around Mount Kilimanjaro with the Maasai have now improved more and more, the raids of the latter have stopped before the artless fortifications of the mountain dwellers and both parties can now trade with each other on equal terms. -- The section of the Maasai known as the Wakuasi (see above of Dschagga, around Aruscha, also at Taweta) has begun to lead a settled life. - Within a short time, these civilized Maasai will also be stronger in number and superior to the proud nomadic Maasai; in this way, eastern equatorial Africa will be opened up to safe and advantageous trade. In the worst case, the Maasai are neither as dangerous nor as bloodthirsty as the Arabs of Sudan. If forced to defend themselves, this people proves powerless against a pallisade because they have no guns and never throw their spears. We may gratefully acknowledge that Mohammedanism has not yet reached them and turned them into mad fanatics or faithless cutthroats, like their neighbors to the north and west." So much for Johnston. Our Hessel reports on the friendly intercourse of the Maasai at the stations of the German=East African Society. In this respect, therefore, concerns appear to be unfounded, especially if the natural humidity of the entire region is taken into account when selecting the site and if the same is applied to the area.

this is helped as far as necessary by artificial installations. As is well known, Dschaggaland itself stretches like a belt around the south-western, southern and south-eastern slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro, a plateau that rises slightly from about 1000 to 1800 meters above sea level and is torn by many ravines. It shares with all the mountain countries the political disintegration into a large number of small tribes. If these were at times involved in feuds, despite being related by blood and language, our friend Mandara, the ruler of Moschi, seems to have been mainly responsible for this. Seduced by slave-trading Swahili from the coast, he had set out years ago to plunder and ravage the territories of his neighbors. But since these attempts had failed due to the united resistance of the latter, his warlike zeal had cooled down again and the former peaceful conditions had returned. Even during Johnston's presence, in 1884, there were not infrequent mutual disturbances; at a congress arranged by Johnston, all the Jagga states showed themselves inclined to a general alliance, if only Mandara, who alone had not sent an envoy, would pay a certain penance for his earlier incursions. Since then, German influence has had a calming effect. Four years later, Hessel was in no doubt that the peace would be permanent: all the unrest had not been caused by a conflict of interests, but merely by the encroachments of Mandara, who later became much wiser. All the Europeans who avoided the mistake of taking sides in the battle were met with the greatest kindness by the Wajagga. As a result of their aptitude and diligence, they have reached an astonishing level in agriculture for Africa and will, by their mere example, be an important factor in the education of our liberated people. Since v. d. Decken's report until the most recent one, which we owe to Hessel, only one voice has spoken about the efficiency of the Wadschagga people. And this is a very significant moment for our aims: The Wajagga are completely unfamiliar with the slave economy; through their energetic resistance to Mandara and the great willingness with which they accepted Johnston's proposal of an alliance directed against the coastal Arabs, they have proven how resolutely they oppose all efforts of the slave traders. The news about the climate and the fertility of the soil is no less favorable. Even in the hottest season, the temperature is such that Europeans can pursue their occupation without detriment to their health. The highest temperature observed by Weiß in June, i.e. at the beginning of spring, was 18½ degrees R., the lowest 11. - While wheat and all northern plants thrive in the higher regions, the lower ones (on which we will be dependent due to our consideration for the Africans) allow the cultivation of bananas, maize, tobacco, which grows everywhere en masse and should be capable of refinement, cotton, sugar cane and coffee. In all this, the most favorable experiences have been made partly by the natives and partly by Europeans; the majority of the plants mentioned already grow wild. According to Johnston, nothing would stand in the way of the production of cocoa. tea and vanilla. According to v. d. Decken, the bananas of Djaggaland are only surpassed in quality by those of Great Comoro. According to the unanimous observations of the travelers, the plants grow with astonishing speed. In addition to this wealth of vegetation, there are now a number of articles whose export will contribute significantly to an early return on the capital invested in a colony there. The horns of the very common rhinoceros can be bought for a few pence cloth and sold on the coast for 5 marks a pair. Hippos are also common and their hides, properly prepared, also sell well. But the great wealth of the region is based on its ivory, which is said to outsell every other kind on the Zanzibar market. It is obtained in such quantities that there is always more than enough to satisfy the many caravans that pass through the land between Nyanza and the Indian Ocean every year. The elephant is found by the thousands in the vicinity of Kilimanjaro, where it has become a complete inhabitant of the mountains. Johnston quotes 1-2 marks as the purchase price for a pound of ivory; on the coast it has a value of 6-10 marks. Wild animal skins are also an important export item - a leopard skin can be bought for goods worth 2-3 marks and sold on the coast for 8-9 marks - and hides, which are valued so low by the natives that they can be had for almost nothing.

In view of such favorable trade prospects, the fatal circumstance that the distance from the coast is so great appears in a somewhat milder light. Hessel needed 28 days for the outward journey from Pangani to Moschi and 17 days for the return journey. White took 31 days for the outward journey and 19 days for the return journey, which was severely hampered by rain. According to Johnston, the route Mombas=Moschi (through the English sphere of interest) is 4 days shorter. But both routes have the advantage over all other routes to Inner Africa that neither the climate nor the terrain presents the traveler with any particular difficulties. Dr. Friedrich Back. German emigration. The emigration question, this difficult problem of German colonial policy, has not yet come a step closer to being solved. If one asks why the Reich government is still hesitating to do something effective to control the flow of German emigrants, which has long been recognized as necessary from an economic point of view, then the view that the government of a country that does not have its own suitable overseas colonization areas should limit itself to increasing the opportunities for gainful employment in the home country as far as possible, but otherwise refrain from directly influencing those who are determined to emigrate, may be partly decisive. It can be acknowledged that such a view appears to be justified in every way, but on the other hand it must also be conceded that the assumption that a sufficient number of new employment opportunities could be created in the mother country, or that economic development would make emigration unnecessary at all, cannot be proven by the probable forecast. For this reason, private enterprises that set themselves the task of directing the flow of emigrants and are supported in this by sufficient capital and guided by good principles will undoubtedly sooner or later be able to count on a benevolent assessment and support from the organs of the state. In one respect, however, more could already be done by the Reich for the emigration question, even if it were to reject any direct intervention in the control of the flow of emigrants, and that is the enrichment of the statistical material. Today, the Reich does not even initiate the necessary surveys of emigrants' occupations. It would undoubtedly be easy for the local authorities, who in most cases are very well informed about the circumstances of the natives, to make precise inquiries about the reasons for emigration as well as the means and final destination of the emigrants. From this knowledge it would then be possible to deduce with certainty something precise about the causes of emigration, whereas today the door is open to every conjecture. A further advantage would be that a more definite assessment of the true aims of emigration would be gained, and perhaps attempts could be made to find out what would happen to the people over there. For one can already assume for certain that many emigrants are mistaken about their future, much longed-for foreign homeland, and that they have wrongly considered their situation in their old homeland to be poor and unsatisfactory. Even if good statistics uncover many evils in our country, they must have a more salutary effect by eliminating deceptions and misunderstandings. By improving statistics, in addition to the thorough monitoring of the agent system, which already exists in the main today, and by benevolently supporting good colonization ventures, the Reich should initially be able to meet reasonable requirements for the benefit of the emigration question. In the main, however, it will always depend on the free association of capital and labour to form overseas colonization enterprises, which the government will supervise and protect. As reluctant as German capital has shown itself to such ventures so far, this state of affairs will not always remain so and a change must occur sooner or later, since there is a need and security in the colonization business to enable a profitable investment of funds The German colonization companies that exist now mostly suffer from a lack of capital; When one hears that the usual interest rate in South American countries is 20 to 30 percent, at which German colonists borrow the capital they need, one knows from this single fact alone what a useful and high task German capital still has to fulfill in those countries where German settlements are relatively dense. There is no other way in which money proves to be more effective as an edhic force than when it helps to bring healthy colonizations into being or to free existing ones from the pressure of financial need in the right way. From the above points of view, the following considerations will attempt to determine whether certain generally valid propositions can be derived from experience, which can serve as a basis for assessing the question of emigration and can be applied in part or in full to every colonization enterprise with certainty; they are intended to provide a guideline for recognizing a settlement business as a good and expedient one in its basic conditions. Of course, this essay is only an attempt and, given the difficulty of the subject, is recommended to the kind indulgence of the reader. On the causes of German emigration. Almost all experts agree on one point, namely that one of the main motives for emigration is relative overpopulation. The population in Germany has grown to a greater extent than it has been possible to create new living conditions or expand the existing economic order to the same extent. Opinions differ, however, as to how the lack of space for the growing knowledge and skills in the fatherland can be remedied, and how the labor and capital resources that are taken away from the fatherland by emigration can be preserved for it.
According to W. Roscher, the main motive for almost all emigrations of our day, to America, Australia, etc., is a relative overpopulation: competition in the economic field, the oppressive overcrowding of most higher professions, the disproportion between our one-sidedly increased education and the narrowness of our spatial resources. According to Dr. Fabri, it is essentially the struggle for existence that causes mass emigration. Emigration is naturally strongest where wages are the lowest and where agrarian conditions are such that the field worker is not in a position to acquire his own property. Hübbe=Schleiden explains emigration by the fact that knowledge and skills are seeking utilization; an expansion of our national economic area alone is capable of ensuring the normal development of our national life and the prosperity of our nation. Professor Rein considers emigration to be the natural consequence of an increase in population in a country whose soil and industry do not offer sufficient employment and earnings for this increase under the present conditions: he sees it as the outflow of a full cistern with a constant supply of water. Jannasch is of the same opinion; he does not regard emigration and colonization as arbitrary and accidental, nor as artificially created facts, but describes them in their present expansion as a necessary consequence of recent economic development. The continuing industrial overproduction of the European countries, with the difficulty of expanding the domestic market directly at the national borders, results in the necessity of seeking this expansion from afar. Added to this is the concern of our small rural landowners that, under the influence of circumstances, their children or certainly their grandchildren will fall into the arms of the proletariat. Our colonial politicians, such as Prince Hohenlohe=Langenburg, Dr. Hammacher. Dr. Miquel and others unanimously describe German emigration as a historical fact that has existed in the past and will continue to exist, which must be explained by history, by our overall social and economic conditions. Since the need for expansion affects not only individual classes of labor, but also all branches of labor and professions, given the uniform growth of all sections of the population, the cry of distress due to overcrowding goes through the so-called working population no more or less than through the propertied population. As difficult as it is for the wage laborer to find the expected (or often sufficient) wages for his work, the propertied laborer struggles and struggles to maintain what he has earned. "It is astonishing," says the report of the German Society in Baltimore of 1888, "what a number of well-trained and educated men and youths, although completely unfamiliar with the local conditions and the English language, are trusting in their work.

uninformed, in the firm conviction that as soon as they arrive they are sure of a good job because of their knowledge. Too late, unfortunately, they only find that their illusions are not realized, and a few who possess a healthy body, energy and strong will accept the situation and begin to work and may later obtain a position corresponding to their abilities in some cases; others, whose relatives are of means, write to them and ask for money for the return journey, the rest go into the country to increase the already strong element of "tramps". The stately documents on the occupations of the immigrant Germans in the United States also show very clearly that all professional classes in the mother country must have contributed their share to these emigrants. According to the 1880 census, immigrant Germans were represented in all occupations. A few figures may illustrate this in more detail. In that year, immigrant Germans were employed in agriculture: approx. 240,000 as farmers and planters, 50,000 as farm laborers, 8,000 as gardeners and winegrowers, 1,500 in dairy farming, 500 as shepherds, 400 as cattle breeders, and so on. Under the heading "various professions" the following are listed: 7000 barbers and hairdressers, 1200 owners of eating houses, 4200 clergymen, 64000 housekeepers, 5000 employees in restaurants and eating houses, 4000 hotel owners, 5000 launderers, 750 lawyers, 4000 musicians, 2700 government officials, 2550 doctors, 240 restaurateurs, 4500 teachers and so on. Under trade and transport are listed, among others: 1000 agents without further description, 800 bankers and fund brokers, 3200 bookkeepers in stores, 17 500 salesmen in stores, 1600 traveling salesmen, 13 000 carters, 10 000 railroad employees, 7000 housekeepers, 1800 milkmen, 2700 officials in horse-drawn railroads, etc., 3100 pack porters, 2100 sailors, 2000 salesmen and saleswomen, 20,200 publicans and public housekeepers, 11,000 merchants without a specific name, 1700 shoe merchants, 2600 cigar and tobacco merchants, 3000 men's clothing merchants, 1100 drug merchants, 6000 manufactured goods merchants, 17000 colonial goods merchants, 3200 wine and spirits merchants, 3800 food merchants, 600 land merchants.
Finally, there is the long list of those employed in industry, crafts and mining, of which we list only the most noteworthy: approx. 14,000 bakers, 15,000 rough blacksmiths, 1,000 bleachers and dyers, 1,100 bookbinders, 28,000 shoemakers, 10,000 brewers, 3,000 brickyard workers, 18,000 butchers, 600 building contractors, 12,500 cabinetmakers. 30,000 carpenters, 6,000 wheelwrights, 12,000 cigar makers, 1,600 clockmakers. 2700 confectioners, 9000 cooks, 1600 cotton spinners, 3000 unspecified factory workers, 4400 locomotive drivers and stokers, 700 fishermen, 1500 glassmakers, 3000 gold and silver workers, 2200 gunsmiths, 4400 saddlers, 1300 milliners, 900 workers in iron and steel goods, 4000 tanners, 1000 woodcutters and raftsmen, 8000 machinists. 5200 factory owners and foremen, 3000 stonemasons, 12000 bricklayers, 3500 millers, 900 milliners, 10 000 miners, 10 000 painters and lacquerers, 1600 instrument makers, 1200 gypsum workers, 800 lead casters, 3500 book printers and alleographers, 760 quarry workers. 5000 sawmill workers, 600 ship carpenters, 1400 silk weavers, 750 steam boiler makers, 37000 tailors and dressmakers, 4500 plumbers, 1500 cutlers, 2000 upholsterers, 1500 wheelwrights, 2300 wood turners, 3500 wool spinners. Unfortunately, no records are kept by the Reich on the occupations of German emigrants, a deficiency that should be remedied soon; we have to rely solely on American statistics on the occupations of immigrant Germans. This information must therefore suffice for our proof. At first, of course, the consequences of relative overpopulation will affect the bourgeois trades and professions, so that agriculture, crafts, trade and industry, and, of the learned professions, the medical profession, writers, lawyers, etc., will suffer first and foremost. Very soon, however, this will create a push towards the professions of permanent employees, since many (and in the prevailing state of need in the liberal professions, in this case all prudent people) prefer a small salary and a modest but secure position in life to the contingencies of a free existence on their own initiative. Since the premise must now be correct that the effects of relative overpopulation permeate all strata of society equally, the influx into the professions of the fixed') Compendium of the Tenlh Census (June 1, 1880). According to the publications by H. Engelbrecht in the Zeitschrift des königlich preußischen statistischen Büreaus. According to H. Engelbrecht's publications in the Journal of the Royal Prussian Statistical Bureau, the tenlh census, published in 1887, p. 58 et seq., was not limited to certain categories of civil servants, but affected them all equally with slight differences that varied according to the needs of the moment. It is only due to the favor of early circumstances that the excessive influx into the professions of permanent employees has not already become more apparent in its frightening reality. The training and expansion of our military system, the period of organization after 1870/71 in schools, the judiciary and administration has created an extraordinary demand for manpower in all subjects, which has been able to absorb the rich influx of pre-trained elements to a large extent. But even now the learned young civil servant and teacher has to wait a relatively long time for employment and even longer for promotion; the higher and lower military candidates are becoming more and more concentrated and are taking possession of all possible and impossible civic offices; the lower teachers and civil servants, the tax and postal professions, there is almost no professional class of permanent employees in which there would not only be a surplus of pre-trained staff, but in which it would also become increasingly difficult to move up to a satisfactory salary level. This calamity will necessarily have to grow to the extent that the effects of the reorganization of 1870/71, which have so far made the enormous overcrowding in all civil service professions less noticeable, are likely to be brought to a halt very soon. The symptoms of relative overcrowding, the effects of which, as we have seen, are detectable in all occupational classes, manifest themselves everywhere equally in the dissatisfaction with the personal situation. For as soon as the difficulties of working life become too great, hardship and want will be the result. It must not be forgotten, however, that in the socialist tendency of our time there is a more than usual tendency to find one's own situation bad and inadequate without the proper examination and appreciation of foreign conditions, and that it is a habitual weakness of man to blame the difficulties and adversities which no one is spared in the struggle for existence, even the self-inflicted consequences of carelessness and recklessness, on the peculiar social conditions in the home country. "A walk in winter," warns the German Society of the City of New York in its annual report for the year 1886, "in the numerous lodging houses where an unclean night's lodging is provided for 5 or 10 cents, must convince everyone that a large part of the inmates there consist of young people who have only recently immigrated and who, after futile efforts and after the last dollar has been spent, unfortunately regret too late the disastrous step they have taken despite all warnings and often in reckless exuberance.
"I can't do any worse in America than here: "So many people have already succeeded, why shouldn't I succeed too!" With these and similar phrases, the reckless person has allayed his concerns until he finally realizes that getting ahead in a foreign country is far more difficult than he imagined. It is astonishing how wrongly the local conditions are judged even by apparently educated people, of whom one should assume that they are better informed, and with what pretensions many appear whose knowledge justifies far more modest claims. The surgeon believes that he can utilize his knowledge in America as a doctor, the seminarian as a teacher or pastor, the student as a journalist, the young economist as an inspector of large estates; the factory worker would like to improve the poor situation in which he found himself in his old fatherland as a foreman or supervisor in a large factory It is doubtless that the majority of these emigrants have underestimated the value of their former situation in their fatherland and have overestimated to the same extent the employment conditions in the foreign country. All these people turned their backs on their fatherland out of ignorance and error, they may have been inspired by the most honest desire to get ahead.
It has already been indicated above that no records are kept of the occupations of emigrants from the Reich; only the occupations of emigrants who embark in Hamburg are recorded in the Hamburg statistics. German emigration in 1888, from German and, as far as is known, from foreign ports, amounted to a total of 98,568 persons; of these, 52,974 traveled via Bremen alone and 25,402 via Hamburg. The latter thus represent about 25 percent of the total emigration in 1888, of which we have precise information on the occupation. Of these emigrants, 8.9% were employed in agriculture and forestry, 16.7% in trade and commerce, 0.8% in the so-called liberal professions (doctors, teachers, journalists, artists, etc.), and 0.8% in wage labor of a changing nature and servants.
The remaining 42.1% is made up of family members of all of the above. If we want to apply this ratio to the total number of emigrants in 1888, then approx. 15,000 persons were withdrawn from forestry and agriculture, 28,000 from trade and commerce; furthermore, 26,000 wage laborers and servants, 28,000 persons who did not state an occupation, and approx. 1,200 persons belonging to the so-called free professions emigrated. Since the family members were evenly distributed among the above occupations, whereas the wage laborers, servants and persons without an occupation for the most part did not take any family members with them, these two categories may well be reduced by 6000 each and this number may be added to the emigrants in forestry and agriculture. Also among the emigrants belonging to trade and commerce there is usually a larger number of single persons, especially in the commercial sector, so that this figure can also be reduced by 6000 in favor of forestry and agriculture; it can therefore be assumed that forestry and agriculture made at least a deduction of 33% in the previous year.
and agriculture in the previous year at least a deduction of 33,000 persons. In the years 1871 to 1888 inclusive, according to the official records of the Reich, 1769,297 persons emigrated; this figure does not include the German emigrants from individual foreign ports, for immigration to the United States of America alone from 1871 to 1887 (i.e. 1888 not included) amounted to 750 persons from Germany in 1884. During this entire period, it was not the overcrowded provinces that accounted for the bulk of emigrants, but West Prussia, Posen, Pomerania, Hanover. Schleswig=Holstein showed the highest frequency of emigration, i.e. the relatively sparsely populated provinces with predominantly agricultural production.
In the elements of forestry and agriculture, the country is loath to lose the pillars of the national state that have grown together with the native soil; the evil of the emigration of our small farmers and rural workers can, however, only be controlled by material remedies to the extent that it becomes possible to keep the small farmers viable, to give the rural workers sufficient employment, and to create sufficient space for both categories in their striving for independence and in their natural increase within the borders of our state. If we estimate the effect of these measures high enough and add to this the number of those who, converted by instruction, renounce exaggerated claims and are happy to be modest with little at home, then we have done what is conceivably possible to limit emigration. But any surplus remaining above this sum will have to emigrate. The emigration of the surplus population is a natural discharge of surplus forces, a proof of the power of expansion in our people, which cannot be confined and encapsulated by human command or by law within the randomly drawn national boundaries; If this were not the case, vagabondage and rural proletarianism would have to grow rapidly in an alarming manner In order to limit as far as possible the loss which the state suffers through the departure of such valuable inhabitants from the fatherland, and also to take steps on the part of the governments which are aimed at increasing the number of small landowners. In the east of our fatherland, the parcelling out of large estates has recently been added to the cultivation of heaths and moors. It remains to be seen to what extent this can meet the existing needs and remedy the prevailing imbalance between the rapid increase in the rural population and the inadequate basis of their existence. If, however, many experts agree that this means of relief will only have a very slow effect and will not eventually be able to fully satisfy the need, there are two important reasons for this view. On the one hand, the high land rent and the resulting intensive form of our present-day agriculture is a serious obstacle to small-scale farming, so that certain local conditions are necessary for its preservation; on the other hand, we rightly have large landowners with all their forest, hunting, fishing and other rights, and some of this can certainly be taken away, but certainly not enough, since large-scale agriculture is just as necessary for the whole as large-scale industry makes it really efficient. No matter how quickly the parcelling out of larger estates and the reclamation of moorland will proceed, our rural population will continue to have to shed a surplus of labor, and if this labor cannot find work and good wages in domestic enterprises, as was the case in the 1970s with the development and increase in industrial production, it will naturally choose its way across the sea to foreign countries In addition to forestry and agriculture, there is an almost uniform overcrowding in all other branches of employment and occupations. According to the thorough studies by Jannasch and Hübbe=Schleiden, our area of consumption has long been too narrow compared to our actual production, let alone our production capacity and necessity. Hübbe=Schleiden calculates that if emigration (1860-1879), considered as the measure of the surplus forces of a people with a limited economic area, were in direct proportion to exports, Germany's report would have had to be 9 times as large as France's; but it was not half as large. The export of England should have been only half to ¾ as great as that of Germany, and yet it was 5½ times as great. Jannasch regards it as our foremost task to utilize mobile labor and capital abroad in the interests of our own economy in such a way that these productive forces are at the same time the cause for increasing the consumption of our industrial products
(To be continued.) Dr. Velow on Maxiko. The "Germania", which is published in the city of Maxiko, published a reply to the article by Dr. Below in No. 30 of the "Deutsche Kolonialzeitung" in its No. 196 of January 4, from which we have excerpted in order to give the opposing view its due and not to give the impression that we identify with Dr. Below's statements. Below's remarks: Much of what the author finds reprehensible about the conditions here is the truth and it is only to be regretted that it is mixed with so many exaggerations. There is still a great deal, an infinite amount of braid in the country, who can deny that? But the author can hardly seriously support the assertion that Maxiko is in the most decided regression. On the contrary, it is clear to anyone who wants to see without prejudice that Meriko has resolutely and convincingly steered into the path of progress and must necessarily persevere in it. However, if one wants to apply the American standard to every step in a country like Maxiko, inhabited by 10 million people and only recently developed, the comparison is unfavorable. If one also considers that the economic interest of the North American is nothing more than the meanest greed, a disordered national appetite, one will also understand why the Maxican is not too passionate about North American progress and does not forgive the local Germans for their Anglo-Saxon kinship. What are we to make of people who deny foreign interests any concept of justice? How can we love people who only recognize the "mine" but simply ignore the "yours"? From our point of view, we also see that things are not going as they should in the great world republic, and that not insignificant parts of it are in obvious disintegration. We notice there in a relatively but rapidly living organism a moral decomposition of the most evil of all putrefactive processes, and Mr. Below, as a physician, knows that such growths are for the most part incurable and tend to end in the destruction of the organism. Who doubts that there is a huge difference between over there and over there? This is so clear that we can hardly understand how a reasonable person can take the desperate trouble to draw parallels that should not be drawn, to make comparisons where no comparison can be made. Because even if 10,000 liberal, progressive Americans come into the country, Meriko will still be a long way from becoming North America. So far we have not been able to notice much of the surprising efficiency and energy of the Americans. Their industrial and mercantile ventures have for the most part taken an unfortunate course for lack of knowledge of the trade and the country, and only the exploitative businesses, such as the insurance companies, lotteries and canteens, show relative prosperity. The American thus seems to us to be less productive than exploitative, and such a population would be a misfortune for Meriko. If, in spite of these negative characteristics, the American has succeeded in raising his republic to such heights, he has to attribute two-thirds of this success to foreign immigration, whose constantly renewed labor force he has been able to exploit skillfully. Without them, "the world republic" would have remained a rather dismal one. This skillful exploitation is the full-blooded American's own greatest merit, while his own personal work is barely 10 percent of the profit. A constantly renewing, eternally living, intellectual and physical force is an incommensurable capital, and the ugly ingratitude of the American, who, especially in recent times, has mainly aimed at the persecution or suppression of the German language in the public schools, consists in the fact that he cynically denies it

Their railroads are all and all poorly constructed and even more poorly managed, so that even in this field, where they are known to have authority and a monopoly, they have not been able to accomplish anything extraordinarily astonishing. The Americans have set up some new things here, but we don't know exactly why - "it doesn't work". It may be the fault of "palace maclism or the general darkness", in short, things don't work. Instead, a legion of American beggars and "hitchhikers" flooded the capital during the latter period, who, when they weren't drunk as hell, made the streets unsafe and begged the "greaserst" in an outrageous manner. The German-American Clement is unfortunately also strongly represented here. Let us now turn to the Mexican trade, which Dr. Below mistreats in such an unforgivable way. Here again the exaggerations are mixed up with the truths. If only he had contented himself with simply placing the indisputable truths alongside the facts! They are serious enough on their own to be accepted even by the obstinate pigtail man. There was no need for embellishment. The author accuses the merchant class. of having spread darkness over the country and its circumstances for the purpose of depriving strangers of insight. This accusation results from Dr. Below's complete ignorance of Mexican trade history Let us look back twenty years, and twenty years are a second in the life of a nation. To the north, Maxiko was cut off from any connection by deserts. It took 2-3 months to transport goods from Chihnahua to the capital. The transportation of goods to and from Beracruz took almost a month, correspondence five days. Passage traffic could only be managed by diligences and was dangerous and disproportionately expensive. Veracruz was the only gateway to the Republic. These communications were interrupted for six months of the year, either because of the rainy season or because of the revolution. Under such conditions, Dr. Below demanded a clear view of the entire country! Under such abnormal conditions, trade suffered most of all and had to laboriously find its own way in the "darkness". Since trade itself lived in general darkness and had to overcome the same difficulties, it could not "spread light" either, because the medium, communication, is part of improvement In the desolate confusion, trade had enough to do to protect its own interests and could not concern itself with trade policy clarifications. And what use would they have been for a country that went from one revolution to another? We have been enjoying the blessings of peace and railroads for 15 years now, and there has been a lot of "light" since then. To our knowledge, commerce has never complained about "the light" and certainly has no interest in restoring the former darkness. We will not come back to the myth of the robber gangs, which the trade pays for, because Dr. Below himself does not believe in it. However, the fact that even the consulates of the various governments have been industrious in writing false reports and creating "darkness" is so colossal and monstrous that we are quarantining this assertion for the time being, together with Dr. Below. Dr. Below proposes as a means of countering this darkness that the consulates be staffed with professional consuls... Every transition from one situation to another, with completely changed living conditions in its wake, especially when it occurs suddenly, brings things to light that lend themselves to contemplation and criticism, because a certain number of existences flounder like fish on the sand. The author raises a great clamor about this, although he can see the same thing every day everywhere and once above all in the United States. Some things in Mexican commerce were very much bogged down; some things survived completely, others were even upheld against all common sense; in its common interests it was disintegrated and fragmented by petty jealousies and business envy. Then came the new era with steamship lines, railroads, banks, falling silver prices and created new and very different conditions of existence. Elements that do not have the necessary strength of character and elasticity to adapt to them must give way. Thus, for example, the German trade in Maxiko lost two-thirds of its sphere and is in danger of losing the last third as well. We are now undergoing great labor pains in a new formation, but we would like to point out to Dr. Below that we do not need an obstetrician. We will do it ourselves. The author criticizes the one-sidedness of local trade, which, according to him, deals purely with customs, bills of exchange, goods and money transactions, has no factories and is turned away from industry. In addition, the "vera elfigie" of the North American merchant, who thinks and acts quite differently, is understandable. When the doctor speaks of Mexican trade in general, he is wrong, for who owns the many manta and estampado and woolen goods factories, which can brazenly compete with their counterparts in the United States in terms of quality and the magnificence of their facilities and operations, and even surpass them in some places. As far as we know, they belong to Mexican, Spanish French and, albeit in small numbers, German trading houses, which in turn are integral parts of the Mexican trade. Factories employing from 1200 to 4000 workers are not uncommon in Meriko. All these factories cover the demand for staple articles of the textile industry so completely and have wrung theft so completely out of the hands of Europeans and Americans that today there is little or no room for the import of European goods. The needs of the common people are fully met by their own industry.
A criticism from mission circles about the activities of Paul Reichard. We have received the following from Mr. Mission Inspector Zahn: It is only very late that I see that you referred to me in No. 3 of the Deutsche Kolonialzeitung. Regarding a letter in which Professor Dr. Schweinfurth expresses his appreciation of Paul Reichard, you remark that this judgment is all the more important "as Paul Reichard has often enough been denigrated in missionary writings". You do not provide any evidence for this assertion; you only cite me as an example by quoting a statement that I made in the Allg. Miss. magazine (1890, January, page 27), which is supposed to mean without right. "Denigrate" someone by giving them a bad name. I do not wish to denigrate anyone and must deny that I have denigrated Mr. P. Reichard; I regret that you have only reproduced the last of my sentences. Please allow me to remind you of the context. After Arnot's report, I said a few things about Msidi and also did him a little justice, or at least excused him. Then I continued: "His wars were basically only wars of conquest and plunder; the spoils were slaves, and Arnot has much to tell of the misery that these wars bring. In passing, we may well recall that apart from Arnot, only the Portuguese Senhor Jvens and the Germans Dr. Böhm and P. Reichard got to know Msidi. The latter two considered themselves entitled to support Msidi in these military campaigns in order to achieve their own geographical goals. Dr. Böhm died there, Father Reichard, one of those African travelers whose misfortune and misfortune it is to shed much blood, later had to flee from Msidi.
Then came the sentence you quote: "It is very regrettable that men like Paul Reichard, who can only carry out their explorations in Africa with bloodshed, are allowed to act as advisors at home on how to treat Africans, free and slave. So where is the denigration? The fact that Mr. Reichard had bloody clashes with the natives, not only at Msidi, will not be disputed. Do you not believe that this was a misfortune for Mr. Reichard? Anyone who is forced to take a human life on his own behalf without holding an official office will not easily be relieved of the pressure of heavy responsibility. And the life of an African should be just as sacred to us as that of a European. Are these hostile encounters not also a misfortune for Africa? The Europeans have succeeded in stirring up almost the whole of Africa to fight against them. Among the many abuses for which this is responsible, not the least is that explorers find themselves as belligerent strangers in the interior of Africa. They make the way more difficult for themselves, but even if they manage to get by, they make the work of their successors more difficult and cause difficulties for the quiet work without which Africa will not receive the blessing of European culture. The experienced African Westbeach gave Arnot the good advice: "Make a good name for yourself among the natives! To the detriment of themselves and Africa, many travelers now have the misfortune of having to use violence and making the name of the European hated in Africa. Perhaps I am not entirely alone when I say that it is more than a misfortune, it is an injustice. Whether Mr. Paul Reichard had a right to all the warlike clashes on the journey into Africa and the return journey, I leave undiscussed now. Suffice it to say that he helped the Msidi in a war that was waged for the purpose of conquest and robbery. The European foreigners were hardly in a position to judge whether the war was just or unjust. So they could not be entitled to take part in it. Nor would it have occurred to them if they had not believed that a different morality applied to Africa than to Europe, that the tribes or small tribes there had no rights which the strong were morally obliged to respect. This disregard for the rights of the natives is another reason for so many difficulties encountered by Europeans. Of course, if one takes the Arabs as a model, there is no need to respect the law. But if you want to plant Christian culture, you have to start by respecting the rights of the natives. Even those who cannot agree with this judgment will admit that it is, if not wrong, at least unfortunate to have so many hostile encounters with the natives in the pursuit of peaceful intentions. When Mr. Wißmann was commissioned to pacify East Africa, I took the liberty of saying publicly that the best guarantee of his success was that, as was said in his honor at the British National Convention, he had twice crossed Africa without doing anything to defend himself. In Africa he plays a miserable part who does not know how to be an authority. And in Africa, as here, it is a sure testimony to a man's ability to exercise authority if he is rarely compelled to use force. In my experience, it is always the clumsy ones in Africa who talk so much about the need for force and violence. Mr. Reichard's experiences seem to testify that he had to resort to violence only too often. F. M. Zahn. We have given Mr. Paul Reichard Kenninis of this article, who has asked us to include the following reply. Reply. First of all, I declare that in the following I do not intend a defense, for qui s'excuse s'accuse, but only a rebuttal of Mr. F. M. Zahn's attacks. I would not have embarked on a polemic if Mr. F. M. Zahn had not been the "Deutsche Kolo


Page 74

nial newspaper" for the publication of his omissions. Mr. F. M. Zahn says right at the beginning of his letter that he has "somewhat justified or at least excused" the chief Mstrri, who is not called Msidi. But Mr. F. M. Zahn, with his vividly developed sense of justice - at least he always emphasizes the injustice done to the Negro, but never that done to the white man - seems to have to condemn me completely. Let us take a look at the famous chief Msirri, whom I had the opportunity to get to know sufficiently during my stay in his countries from October 29, 1883 to September 25, 1884: Msini is one of the cruelest, most insidious, most boshastic, most cowardly, most unfaithful and most wanton blacks that Africa has ever produced. He is almost proverbial in Katanga because of his mendacity; no report, however beautifully colored, will be able to wipe away this fact. Mstrri is in the habit of burying people alive, staking them and mutilating them horribly in all parts of their bodies. He immediately used a feather hook I gave him as a thumbscrew. During the siege of Katapäna, he managed to seize the brother of that chief by means of a very vile betrayal and then had his skin flayed off while he was still alive and a bedstead covered with it. I have seen such things happen to him with my own eyes. - And Mr. Zahn takes up the cudgels for this hallunk! He should be a little more careful in his own interest; he is only showing that he himself lacks the ability to judge African things, which he dares to deny me.
Now, as far as my battles are concerned, I have the following to say in reply, provided, of course, that Mr. Zahn does not also see this as an injustice against the blacks, since research tires are being undertaken: Mr. Zahn says: "Whoever in our country, without holding an official office, is compelled to take a human life in his own cause, does not easily get rid of the pressure of heavy responsibility. In the interior of Africa, where the traveler is outside the sphere of power of any European state and therefore cannot be protected by it, he is his own master and king and even his own supreme authority. He owes protection to the people who entrust themselves to him as porters and soldiers. It happens very often that travelers are attacked and I am not the only one to whom this has happened. In such cases, I allow myself to make use of the right of defense to which I am entitled, and I will not allow this right to be abridged even by Mr. F. M. Zahn. Missionaries have also had to take up arms more than once, but to allow oneself to be trampled on by the Negroes is partly a matter of character and partly a matter of taste, and if Mr. Zahn would prefer to be beaten to death in a given case, that is his business, but he cannot reasonably demand the same of others. I had no desire to die as a martyr without selling my life as dearly as possible. Besides, my life, like that of a white man in general, is much more sacred to me than that of a black man. As for Mr. Zahn's remarks about African morals and Arab patterns, my pride and dignity forbid me to go into them any further. As for Mr. Zahn's opinion of our participation in the war campaigns of the Msirri, I deny him any judgment on it, for he lacks all knowledge of the facts. Mr. Zahn's judgment is one-sided, in that he only lends his ear to the Msirri, whose words were conveyed to him by Mr. Arnot. Whether I am regarded as clumsy in the eyes of Mr. Zahn is a matter of indifference to me, and it is a matter of the greatest satisfaction to me that men more competent than he judge me quite differently. Likewise, Mr. Zahn is not in a position to judge the justification of my battles at all, and I reject this in the strongest possible terms and explain to him that I regret nothing of what I did in Africa and would do exactly the same today, even without Mr. Zahn's approval. Mr. F. M. Zahn tells of an escape on my part from Mirri. Here, too, he is ill-informed. I left Katanga in broad daylight at 7 o'clock in the morning with flying flags, playing music, accompanied by the war songs of my people, for the sole reason that I no longer had any barter goods. In four battles I repulsed the hordes of the Mstrri with bloody heads, after the brave chief had not dared to let me attack other than far from his capital. If Mr. Zahn believes at the end that I exercised no authority in Africa, it only serves him that tribute was paid to me everywhere. My own people positively adored me and are still eagerly awaiting my return. The chief Adischa of Ugunda has even repeatedly sent me a message to Europe asking me to return there, which does not indicate any great ineptitude on my part in the treatment of the blacks. On the other hand, Mr. Zahn will be able to hear from more than one traveller to Africa that the over-indulgence of missionaries always made a worse impression on the Negroes than an energetic but just approach by determined explorers, and that where very indulgent missionaries or other travellers have gone along, much greater difficulties have arisen for the following ones than where an energetic approach has created respect for the whites. For me, this statement puts the matter completely to rest, and I will not enter into any further dispute with the "peace-loving" missionaries in this matter. Paul Reichard.
News from the Society. - The Society's committee held a meeting on March 4 under the chairmanship of Mr. Hofmann, Minister of State, at which a number of business matters were dealt with. It was reported that the formation of new sections was progressing well and that new sections had been formed in Oberfrohna, Rostock i. M. and Dirschau. The Berlin branch held its annual general meeting on February 28. After opening the meeting, Privy Councillor of Justice Professor Dr. v. Cuny, the first chairman of the department, reviewed the activities of the department, which had been very energetic and extensive in the past year. He particularly remembered the so-called protest meeting and the meeting to justify the need for a direct German steamer connection with East Africa, also referred to the petition to the Reich Chancellor for the establishment of the aforementioned steamer line and then spoke about another branch of the department's activities, which until now had been limited exclusively to the board. The Board of Directors submitted a number of amendments to the Society's budget, which could provide more funds for practical purposes. At the same time, the Board has made various proposals of a practical nature to the Society's Committee, relating to the support of German doctors wishing to go to East Africa, the establishment of schools and the secondment of technicians. The committee's answer to point I is in the affirmative, to point II it is postponed. The question is to be considered after peace has been established in East Africa. According to the presentation by Mr. Regierungsbaumeister Wiskow, the department currently has 858 members and has held 35 lecture evenings, 30 men's evenings and 4 ladies' evenings in the past year. 4 discussion evenings, 4 ladies' evenings and 5 large lecture evenings were held. The library has 110 volumes and 30 maps. According to the treasurer's report, the department had. Kunstverlagshändler C. Grunert, on January 1, 1889, the department had a cash balance of 4031.34 marks. Of this, 2000 marks were transferred to the "German Women's Association for Nursing in the Colonies". The Emin Pasha Committee received the remainder of 2031.34 marks. The income for the year 1889 amounted to 11,951.60 marks, which was offset by an expenditure of 8366.44 marks, so that on December 31, 1889 there was a surplus of 3585.16 marks. In accordance with § 6 of the Articles of Association, the following five members of the Board of Directors were removed: Art publisher C. Grunert. Marshal v. Biberstein. Julius Runge, government master builder Wiskow and government master builder Storck. Reg.=Assessor Angerer proposed re-election by acclamation. This was accepted. The 5 gentlemen mentioned were thus re-elected. The department decided to express its thanks to the Chancellor for having refused his consent to the intended sale of part of the property of the German Southwest African Company to a Dutch-English consortium. -- A very interesting lecture on his voyages along the East African coast was given on February 7 by naval chaplain Wangemann. After visiting the Somali coast, he came to the wide and safe Manda Bay, the advantages of which he described in detail, emphasizing in particular the fertility of the Witulestland, especially in Wange. In the speaker's opinion, the Swahili people, which originated from a mixture of Arabs and Negroes, have a significant future for East Africa and are distinguished in many ways from the other natives. In the lecture, the mouth of the Umbe River with the mountains of Usambara visible in the distance, the mouth of the Wami and Saadani, where Bana Heri used to be Wali, the bars of the Kingani River, the stately Bagamoyo with its 300 white houses surrounded by countless huts and its 25-30 thousand inhabitants (a "little Paris") and then Dar=es=Salaam were dealt with in more detail or only touched upon. This place consisted only of ruins. Bushiri had burned it down. Its name evoked wistful memories in the speaker. It was here that Lieutenant Landfermann, who had fallen in battle against the insurgents, was laid to rest, while all around him the enemy bands swarmed out fighting and threatening and could only be prevented from disturbing the funeral ceremony by setting up a ring of archers. The coastline south of Dares=Salaam is of less interest to us. At best, Kilwa could still be considered, but it has unfavorable landing conditions due to the existing mud bank. The lecturer concluded his interesting, vivid description with a warm appeal to the patriotism and willingness to make sacrifices of his listeners. The land described belongs to us Germans only externally for the time being. We must first conquer it for the sake of Germanness. Our allies here are not the Arabs and Indians, but the natives, especially the Suabeli. We must accommodate them. They have never felt comfortable and secure in the slave economy. Let's give them the security and peace they need. We must not only send people who want to conquer and administer or only want to earn money; we need to send roughnecks who get close to the natives personally, stay with them, teach them Christian and German customs and put themselves at the service of charity, like the missionaries and nurses do. The Darmstadt department organized a lecture evening on 3 February, at which Count Eberhard zu Erbach von Aschaffenburg spoke about the history of the secession of the South American colonies from Spain and the formation of "the republics under Bolivar". The speaker, who is very familiar with South American conditions through his travels and studies, dealt with a finely interesting and comprehensive topic in a concise, captivating manner and poetic language in a 1½-hour lecture, which was loudly applauded by the selected audience. Later still

Mr. Marinepfarrer Wangemann gave an extremely attractive and illustrative lecture on East Africa for the benefit of the German hospital in Zanzibar, which also brought in a considerable contribution from here. - Karlsruhe Branch. On March 5, the ordinary annual meeting of the local department took place under the chairmanship of President Grimm. Mr. Grimm presented the annual report, in which he gave an accurate account of the events of the past year, both in the colonial development of Germany and in the life of the colonial association. The accounts were approved and the previous Board of Directors was unanimously re-elected. As before, Mr. President Grimm held the chair, the treasurer was Mr. Major (ret.) Carl Hoffmann and the secretary was Mr. Landgerichtsrat Goldschmidt. In addition, Dr. Valentiner, Professor at the Technical University here, gave a lecture on the German Togo Colony, in which the history of the acquisition, as well as the promising nature of the country, which is still so little observed even in colonial circles in Germany, and which has already reached the size of Württemberg and Baden together, was given a captivating expression. Clomberg Department. The first chairman of the department, Professor Dr. Kleinert, who rendered outstanding services not only to the formation of the department but also to its subsequent development, died at the end of February. In him, the colonial idea has lost a convinced and active collaborator. On February 5, the department held a very well-attended foundation celebration, to which its own illustrious festive newspaper contributed a great deal. Erfurt department. On Wednesday, March 5, Mr. Paul Reichard gave a lecture on his experiences in Africa to a large audience, which was received with much applause. The lecture was followed by a convivial meeting in the club room in the Hotel Kronprinz, where several gentlemen declared their membership. Small announcements. - (The flag hoisting of the British East African Society on Manda and Patta has, as we expected, not been recognized by the British government. So apparently things will remain as they are for the time being. We only hope that the Imperial Government will now take energetic steps to ensure that these two islands are secured for us, and that the question of the Beledsoni Canal in particular will be resolved in a manner favorable to our interests. Without the Beledsoni Canal, the Witu area has no commercial value for us at all, as we would be cut off from the Tana, about whose development potential both Dr. Peters' and Pigott's reports agree, if the British East African Company were to establish itself there. At the request of the German government, the Saltan of Witu vacated the canal built by his ancestors, although when the treaty on which the Sultan of Zanzibar's alleged right to the Beledsoni Canal is based was concluded, none of the contracting parties assumed that the canal fell within Zanzibar territory. The wording of a treaty, however, especially if it is based on an error, is not alone decisive for the interpretation of international treaties - (German Emin Pasha Expedition.) The news that French missionaries had met Dr. Peters at Tana is now also refuted by Borchert by the following telegram received by the managing committee of the German Emin Pasha Committee from Zanzibar: "English and French report quite incorrect, mistook me for Peters. The latter is probably in Kavirendo (bay in Victoria=Nyanza), I am sending a message to Peters through Uganda missionaries. Borchert. (In Lome), German Togo protectorate, an imperial postal agency was established on March 1. (Franco-German customs unification on the Slave Coast.) According to the agreement concluded between Germany and France on the introduction of a customs fortress in the mutual territories on the Slave Coast, the German and French possessions on the Slave Coast are to form a single customs territory without an intermediate customs border in such a way that one and the same customs duties are levied there and that the goods cleared in one territory can be imported into the other without being subject to a new duty. Imports into the Community customs territory are subject to the following duties: Genever per crate of 8 liters of 0.64-1.60 Marks Rum per liter of 0.03 7/10-0.08 Marks, tobacco per kilogram 0.20 Marks Powder per 100 pounds English 5 Marks. Rifles per piece 1 mark. Salt per ton of 1000 kilograms 8 marks. Customs duties can be levied in German, French and English money. The various forms of coin are regarded as legal tender in the same way as in their country of origin, so that on the one hand all German, French and English gold coins as well as the French silver five-franc pieces and the German one-thaler pieces (3 marks), as long as they are legal tender in Germany, are regarded as legal tender without restriction, while on the other hand the German, French and English coins need only be accepted in payment up to a certain amount, namely the German coins up to 20 marks, the French up to 50 francs and the English up to 40 shillings. The officials of both countries have to exchange the silver coins that have flowed into each other's coffers on a monthly basis, taking as a basis for the exchange the value ratio determined by the tariff (1 mark = 1 shilling = 1 franc 23 centimes). The new customs system comes into force at the same time in the German and French territories, namely from March 15, 1890, and is introduced for a period of one year. If the contracting parties have not given notice of their intention to terminate the contract six months before the expiry of this period, it shall be deemed to be tacitly renewed for a further year, and so on until the expiry of the following periods. This agreement will in any case help to alleviate the reproaches made by the missionaries against the German government for not taxing the spirits trade in the colonies sufficiently. The new rates of duty have doubled everywhere compared to the earlier treaty of 1887. Whereas a crate of jenever (8 liters) used to pay a duty of 0.32-0.80 marks, depending on the alcohol percentage, the duty has now been increased from 0.64 to 1.60 marks. Rum, which used to be subject to a duty of 0.1%-0/4 marks per liter, now has to pay 0.3 2/10-0.8 marks. In addition, the duty on tobacco, powder and guns has been doubled and a new duty on salt has been introduced. Nevertheless, the duties on spirits are still significantly lower than those in Cameroon. (With Dahomey) France may soon be involved in a serious conflict, as the King of Dahemey is determined to expel the French from the coast. Six Europeans are captured by him in Wheidah. (From South Africa.) The dispute in the Transvaal between the leading Clement of the Dutch Boers and the English colonists, who have recently increased in number, has led to regrettable riots on the part of the English gold-diggers. President Kruger was given a very unfriendly reception in Johannesburg by a hostile crowd and demonstrations against the government took place in the market square, during which the flag of the South African Republic was torn down from the government building and destroyed.
(From South West Africa.) The planned sale of part of the German Colonial Society for South West Africa did not materialize. The Reich Chancellor has refused to give his reserved approval to the contract in question. (Richard Jordan), the secretary at the Imperial Commissariat for the protectorate of the New Guinea Company, second lieutenant of the reserve in the 2nd Guards Regiment, died on February 25 in Soerabaya (Java) at the age of 36. - (From East Africa.) Major Liebert and his escort arrived in Sausibar on March 2. Premier Lieutenant Krenzler, company commander in the Schutztruppe for East Africa, has, according to the "Schwäb. Merk.", been appointed by the Imperial Reichskommissar, Major Wißmann, as District Commander of the entire Usambara district, provisionally including the stations of Tanga, Tangata and Pangani. - Ewin Pasha has arrived in Zanzibar on a Wißmann steamer. He is still quite weak as he suffered a severe skull fracture, two broken ribs and a sprained hip when he fell, according to the station doctor at Bagamye, Dr. Brehmer. - The last posts have, as the "Nat.=Ztg." the German East African Society has received unusually favorable and promising reports on the development of its territory. On the occasion of a round trip to the northern coastal areas undertaken by the director of the Society, Vohsen, together with Major Wißmann, peace negotiations were held with the local chiefs and agreements were concluded with numerous tribes concerning the cultivation of commercial crops. Everywhere the returning confidence of the indigenous population, as well as of the Indians and Arabs, made itself felt by the fact that in the places abandoned during the rebellion a strong increase and a lively building activity developed. Dar=es=Salaam, for example, which had declined to 350 souls, already has a population of 3000 souls again. In Bagamoyo, all the large European companies have bought premises and the place is rising extraordinarily fast. In Tanga, traffic is constantly increasing. The German-Oitafrican Company is building a large caravan factory in Bagamoye to accommodate 5000 people, together with extensive warehouses, as well as large factories in several places, and hopes to make considerable profit from this on the basis of the current traffic. In short, the reports are such that the company can look forward to the future with full confidence. A telegram from the "Times" in Zanzibar reports. Major Wißmann is about to attack Bana Heri in Saadani. - Ehlers is on his way back to the coast after visiting Mandara and concluding new friendship treaties along the way. German influence in Usambara is now firmly established. - The Reich Chancellor has received new reports from Major Wißmann, the first of which describes the very fierce battle for Bana Heri's entrenchment on January 4. For the first time, the existence of a religious moment on the part of the Arabs is mentioned, as they were encouraged to fight by the Vorbsters. The second report describes the agreements with the British-East African community regarding the import of weapons. The import of breech-loaders is strictly forbidden [Regulation of jurisdiction over the natives of the Marshall Islands]. The "Reichsanzeiger" has published a supreme decree authorizing the Reich Chancellor to issue the necessary orders for the regulation of jurisdiction over the natives of the protected territory of the Marshall Islands. The provisions of the law concerning the legal relations of the German protectorates, which regulate civil law, criminal law and judicial proceedings, including the judicial constitution in the protectorates, do not, as is well known, refer to the natives, but the Emperor has been authorized to subject the natives to German law and German jurisdiction. From this point of view, by Imperial Decree of July 7, 1888, the New Guinea Company was given jurisdiction over the natives for its territory until the end of 1897, and the same now also applies to the Marshall Islands. It is in the nature of things that the Empire must endeavor to extend its influence more and more.

to extend more to the peoples who have become its wards, even if prudence dictates that this regulation should be applied slowly and cautiously. (In No. 318 of January 18, the "Reform", which is published in Joinville, opposes the statements of Mr. C. Bolle in No. 38 of the German Colonial Newspaper and polemicizes against the author's statements, namely that the provisional government consists of political zeros, that it is possible that the State Councillor Silveira Martins would have protested against the state of affairs and that his arrest was made out of fear of the inhabitants of the province of Rio Grande do Sul and the Germans in the southern provinces who were behind him, and, thirdly, that the composition of the present provisional government will probably not last long. The reform, on the other hand, claimed that the provisional government consisted of highly competent statesmen and that Brazil had never been as well governed as it was today. The arrest of Silveira Martins had been necessitated by the duty of self-preservation, as he had conspired against the existence of the provisional government. The dissolution of the present government would be the greatest misfortune that could befall Brazil, but the government stood firm and secure and exercised its authority with rigor, but also with wise moderation. As the Reform attaches importance to its views being made known here, we are printing extracts of its communications. In addition, the Society's committee (see No. 3 under "Reports from the Society") has expressed the view that the future development of conditions will in no way worsen the situation of German settlers and that emigration to southern Brazil appears no less advisable today than in the past, as soon as political conditions have taken a firmer shape. (On the selection of planters for the colonies, Ostastatischer Lloyd publishes a letter from Sumatra in which the correspondent strongly advises that planters should not be sought in Europe but abroad, and that attention should also be paid to German farmers and foresters, as a skilled workforce would save a lot of training costs: Rietheutein, one of the German aafrik 5.8 mision stations in the otherwise meager entrances for the library. Given the limited space we have for book reviews, it will not be possible to discuss all works in detail, but we never fail to recommend new colonial writings, which are assigned to our library by the authors and publishers, to colonial friends in word and deed, for which the administration of the library is offered many opportunities by our members. Once again, we would like to express our sincere thanks for the books donated to our library. Receipts in February.
