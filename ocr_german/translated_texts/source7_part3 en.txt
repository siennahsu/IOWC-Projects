The state care which the German governments should give to our emigration must be expressed in two ways; firstly, the emigrant needs instruction and protection from the home authorities, and secondly, the state should, in its own interest, support the efforts of the free associations which want to gather together the surplus labor of our people outside and, in conjunction with German capital, utilize it profitably for the mother country. W. Roscher rightly emphasizes that emigration should not be given free rein, that there is still a lack of proper measures to combat ignorance in matters of emigration, and he recommends harsh punishment of any soul-selling activity, strict supervision of emigrant shipping, effective obligation of the consuls who are employed in America, etc., to also help emigrants with advice and assistance. As we have seen in the discussion of the causes of German emigration, there is now even a lack of the necessary statistical surveys on the occupation of the emigrants, on the income and financial circumstances of the individual emigrant families, on the reasons which were decisive in the choice of the new homeland, etc. As long as such surveys, which with the support of the emigrants' home authorities could probably be obtained with little effort and a fair degree of completeness, are still lacking, it is just as impossible to justify a judgment on the causes of emigration in detail with certainty as it is to find the limit to which emigration is unhealthy, i.e. based on self-deception or seduction, and to what extent it must necessarily flow away as a real surplus of labor. It is a demand of simple human kindness that the state should give advice and information to the emigrant. However useful in this respect the free colonial associations and the organs connected with them, such as the Deutsche Kolonialzeitung and Export, may be, they will affect the emigrant circles only in very few cases; a state information bureau, however, would not only provide more effective mediation, but also more comprehensive and reliable information through its foreign representation. The British government has taken account of the need to enable emigrants to reach their destination in the best possible way and to provide them with accurate information about the conditions in the new country. In 1889, a government information bureau for emigrants was set up in London, where emigrants can obtain information free of charge from official sources about the conditions in the various colonies with regard to location, climate, products, religion, education, internal means of transportation, cost of living, wages, land conditions, land system, travel opportunities, passage prices, etc. This bureau is open to all three colonies. Every three months, this bureau publishes short official reports on conditions, work prospects in the colonies, etc., which are available free of charge in every post office.*) The care given by the Swiss authorities to emigrants there is well known. In addition to instructing the emigrant, the state will also take control of the means of transportation and the agent system. In the former respect, all the necessary conditions are generally well taken care of. In this respect, the German emigration system is probably not inferior to that of any other country. On the other hand, the activities of the agents are more questionable. In a country where ignorance of emigration matters is still widespread, the exaggerated claims of good work and employment opportunities in foreign countries will only too easily find a willing audience. However, the activity of the agents will be able to unfold all the more freely and unhindered as there is no authority capable of checking their advertisements and brochures for their inherent factual value. (3) The German Colonial Society has the duty to work towards the removal of such obstacles to a direction of German emigration that is in the interests of Germany as a whole, but in general to influence emigration in the German national interest by providing information and by further developing its information office within the legally permissible limits. In particular, it is incumbent upon it to promote the formation of suitable colonization enterprises and to support their activities. It is the task of the German Colonial Society to strive for the enactment of an imperial law that uniformly regulates the activities and business operations of emigration entrepreneurs and emigration agents in the German Empire. *) On the English free associations for emigration, we refer to an excellent essay by Professor v. Philipoiche in the Deutsche Kolonialzeitung 1888 p. 293 et seq.
This deficiency must be described as particularly harmful, because every untrue offer, every exaggerated advertisement directed at the emigrant is to be regarded as equivalent to persuasion to emigrate. In addition to the necessary reform of the concession system, a well-established information office would also serve as a corrective against the seductive advertisements of emigration agents; such a central office would have at its disposal the information needed to assess the emigration scam. If it follows from our previous consideration of state care for the emigrant that first of all the improvement of statistics must be considered necessary, furthermore that the instruction and personal guidance of the emigrant can be made more comprehensive, and then that the supervision of transportation and the agent system must be the subject of strict control, then a further demand is directed towards the provision of advice and assistance to emigrants in America rc. by our consuls. We need not go into the lack of professional consuls and the desirability of eliminating the titular consuls, as the latter are already on the verge of extinction. (Conclusion follows.) Correspondence. A plantation plant for the colonies. Brussels, March 15, 1890 Our East African lands cover miles of land whose drought does not permit a richer culture. A fiber plant that has only recently been cultivated in the Antilles is extremely suitable for these areas, as it loves such arid stretches and produces the best yields on them. This new plantation plant is the sisal plant. The plant has nothing to do with our Cannabis species, but belongs to the Liliaceae and is the well-known Agave in its varieties Agavo rigida var. Siaalana and Agavo rigida var. elongata. This agave is native to Central America and had already been cultivated in Honduras for several years when Sir Heurv Blake, Governor of the Bahamas, became aware of it and had the plant planted in the Bahamas and Jamaica. The benefits of growing these agaves were soon recognized and in some places the export of the plant was even banned. The fiber that the leaves of the sisal hemp, or, as we prefer to call it, the sisal agave, provide is strong and is found in the leaves in exceptionally large quantities. According to the trade documents, the individual fiber fords were listed as follows: Ton 480 Marks, Polish hemp Jtalian hemp.... . . East Indian hemp ton 90-1100 Manila (product of the Uuss) ton 720 Marks, Mauritius (product of the Foureroya) New Zealander (product of the P'hormium) 100 Sisal (product of the agave The sisal fiber thus gives the best yield next to the Manila. The cultivation of the plant is the simplest imaginable. Any dry, poor soil is suitable for it; it thrives best on pebbly or stony ground. It is not worth growing on moist or fertile soil. All shade is harmful. Young plants that are not yet two feet high are best used. When planting out, the roots are shortened a little and the dry leaves are removed. The plants are planted in straight rows. The distance between them is 12 feet, the distance between the plants is 6 fuk. This planting method produces about 600 agars on the field. The rainy season is the best for preparing the fields. The cultivation is not very easy. Shade is not left, the bushes are cut off, tree trunks are uprooted with the roots. The side shoots may be kept for transplanting, but are separated from the trunk. When the plants are about two years old, Bieh can be left in the plantation to keep herbs and shrubs short. Plowing the soil, hoeing, etc. is completely unnecessary. The plants live on average 15 to 20 years. If they show signs of beginning to die back, sprouts are immediately planted in the rows so that there is always an immediate replacement. Each plant must produce about 30 leaves a year. With 600 plants in the field, that is 18,000 leaves, which yield 1½ tons of sisal fiber per year. Harvesting takes place when the leaf drops and its darker color indicates that it is ripe for cutting. The leaves are cut off close to the stem and the spiny teeth at the edge and the thorny tip are immediately removed, which is particularly necessary with Agavo rigida var. olonguta. The leaves are then packed in bundles for shipment. The workers are paid by the thousand. The leaves mature in 2 to 8 years, depending on the soil. The fiber must be extracted from the leaves as soon as possible. If the leaves are left for a few days, the fiber becomes stained. The fiber is removed by machines. Mr. Presion, who was sent by the Bahama government to examine the plantations in Bucatan, says the following about the defibering as it is done on the plantations there: "On the first plantation there were 6 Death fiber machines in operation, with 8 knives and scrapers, in

Page 98

Set in motion by a powerful 10-horsepower engine from Marsball Sons & Co. Each wheel completed 20 sheets in a minute, 800 in a day. At each wheel, two men pushed sheets into the machine as fast as they could. One boy started a new supply, three others hauled the fiber away. Water is not used for defibering, nor for washing the fiber, which is dried and bleached for two hours on drying frames in the sun. After these two hours, the fabric is ready to be packed into bales. Many plantations have a press for this purpose. Manual machines are not recommended. The working hours at the machine are from 8 a.m. to 12 noon, in the afternoon the workers help to collect the dried fiber." Mr. Preston found a factory in Pucatan that processed 48,000 leaves a day. A pound of fiber cost the factory 5 pennies of Merican silver and was already worth 22 pennies of gold in Merida. There are about 200 such fiber factories in Pucatan, the largest having 90 machines and 500 workers. Most of the larger factories record a daily profit of between 2000 and 8000 marks. The needs of the plant are so small, its preference for short, barren land is so great, that it could be planted with the greatest success in many parts of East Africa and in Lüderitzland R. A. Körnig. Communications from the Society. The Society's Committee held a meeting on April 1, 1890 under the chairmanship of Mr. Simon, retired Government Councillor. The current business was dealt with and motions from Eberswalde, Berlin, Darmstadt and Hanover, which had been referred to the committee by the board for further discussion, were dealt with. As no definitive decision has yet been made, we will refrain from further reporting on these points. The formation of a department in Annaberg is imminent, and one has been formed in Leisnig. The number of members of the Antwerp branch has, as was reported, already increased to 174. - Berlin Branch. At the board meeting held on March 10, it was decided to increase the donations received for a hospital in Zanzibar on the occasion of Mr. Wangemann's lecture to 1000 marks. The offices of the board for the year 1890 were distributed as follows: Mr. Gebeimer Justizrath Prof. De. von Cuny, first chairman, Mr. Graf Behr=Bandelin, first, Mr. Marschall von Bieberstein second deputy. Mr. Regierungsbaumeister Wiskow was appointed first secretary, Mr. Kunstverlagdändler Grunert first treasurer; Mr. J. Runge took over the offices of second secretary and second treasurer. In place of Mr. Ballin, who resigned from the departmental board at his request, Mr. Angerer was elected government assessor. - On March 28, Premierleutnant Weiß spoke about railroad construction in East Africa, particularly with regard to a line from Tanga to Usambara and Aruscha, which would have a total length of 360 km and cost around 10 million marks. The track gauge of the line should be 1 m. with a 3 m embankment in the crown, the gradients and curves could be assumed to be 1:40, the radius 100 m. On the whole, he adopted the system that the Russians had followed in the construction of the Tianskaspian Railway and considered it feasible to transfer it to East African conditions - Cologne department. On March 28, Paul Reichard gave a speech on the borders of German East Africa, after which the following resolutions were adopted in the meeting: 1. In the interest of strengthening German colonial policy in East Africa, it appears necessary to establish political administrative stations, first in Tabora and then on Lake Tanganyika, Lake Victoria and Lake Ryassa. L. For the forthcoming alliances with England, it is recommended that the southern border of German East Africa should be the line running from the Rovuma River at about 12 degrees south latitude to Lake Bangweolo. (3) With regard to the northern German protectorate in East Africa, it seems urgently necessary to secure the Tana River to its mouth as the southern border and the Juda River and its mouth as the northern border for Germany. - Leisnig Division. The executive committee of the department consists of Mr. Holtheuer, secondary school teacher, 1st chairman, Stabsarzt Näther, 2nd chairman. Referendar Dr. Degen, 1st secretary, Postal Director Böticher, 2nd secretary, book printer Ulrich, treasurer. We would like to take this opportunity to thank the gentlemen who have contributed to the establishment of the department. - Department Frankfurt a. M. On April 1, Joachim Graf von Pfeil spoke to the department about his experiences in New Guinea, and presented a vivid, but by no means overly rosy picture of the nature and inhabitants of the German protectorate there. Above all, he emphasized that we must first thoroughly explore and learn about the countries there before we can say how best to colonize them. - This lecture was followed by the general meeting of the department, in which the chairman Dr. Em. Cohn gave a report on the previous year's activities. Apart from the organization of individual lectures, the department has made few public appearances, but the information bureau for emigrants that it set up has been used many times and has had a beneficial effect through instruction and expert advice, often also through warnings against rash emigration. Another project is also coming to fruition thanks to the support of the Palmengaria Association, namely the creation of an acclimatization garden for tropical plants in order to familiarize gardeners who intend to go to the overseas colonies with the cultivation and care of the plants there. Mr. Bolongaro=Crevenna was elected to the board of directors to replace the deceased Commercial Councillor Passavant. Small announcements. (German East Africa.) Negotiations had been initiated between Germany and England to determine the sphere of interest in Africa more precisely, but have come to an immediate standstill. All pending disputes are to be brought to an end once and for all by mutual concessions in accordance with the do ut des principle. We therefore refrain for the time being from making any statement about the way in which we would like to strive for regulation, having indicated the basic lines several times. A more detailed explanation at this point would only draw the attention of disfavored nations. - The "Times" reports from Zanzibar on April 2: Today 600 Sudanese soldiers arrived on an Egyptian steamer for Major Wissmann and were immediately conveyed to Bagamovo. - A proclamation by Emin Pasha has been distributed to the Arabs in the streets of Sanstbar, in which he rejects the common cause with Stanley and the English, who filed a complaint against Tipvo Tip with the consular court, and proclaims his friendship with the Arabs. - Emin Pasha has entered the German service and will shortly leave for the Jnnern with a caravan comprising several German officers and several hundred Sudanese. - Banaheri made peace and returned to Saadani. - Major Wißmann forbade the caravans to enter the German sphere, north of Tanga, without his permission. - Major Wißmann has placed the coastline from Rusidit to Rovuma under martial law. - The commissioners sent by the Sultan of Sanstdar on a conciliatory mission to the southern ports have returned without having achieved anything. - The health of the German Schutztruppe was exceptionally good in January and February. - lr. Baumann set off from Tanga with an expedition to establish the route for a railroad to Kilimanjaro. - The new mail steamer line, which will soon be running the first steamer to East Africa, will dock not only in Sanstbar but also in Dar es=Salaam and continue to Delagoabai. A separate coastal steamship line will be established to connect the coastal ports. (Witu.) According to the "Times" of April 2, Consul General Michahelles wanted to leave for Lamu in a short time with 2 gunships to pay a visit to the Sultan of Witu. (Cameroon.) The Cameroon statistics on imports and exports, which have now been introduced by decree, show the following figures for imports from July 1 to December 31, 1889: Rum and jenever 468,095 liters. Cognac, liqueurs rc. 9748 liters, firewater 5446 pieces. Powder 141,628 kilos, salt 704,212 kilos, tobacco 54,399 kilos. Cigars 376 kilos, beer 36,231 kilos, wine 13,829 kilos, iron and steel goods 34,950 kilos, timber, barrels and wooden goods 171,529 kilos, clothing, linen rc. 2788 kilos. Linen, rope goods rc. 8051 kilos, material and confectionery x. 90,876 kilos, petroleum r 10,689 kilos, soap and perfumery 10,354 kilos, coal and briquettes 400,020 kilos, cement 37,090 kilos and the like. The Association for Protestant Mission in Cameroon held its annual meeting in Stuttgart on March 25. The main idea behind the founding of the association, that the funds for this new mission in the German protectorate should be raised in Germany, is still far from being achieved. While the expenditure for the Cameroon mission amounted to 42,900 marks in 1887, 51,000 marks in 1888 and 72,000 marks in 1889, the total income in the period of initial enthusiasm was 56,500 marks in 1887, but only 18,700 marks in 1888 and 24,600 marks in 1889. Although the mission in Cameroon had only been taken over by the Basel Missionary Society as a result of German patronage and at the request of all sides from Germany, the contributions from Germany excluding Württemberg only amounted to 30,400 marks in 1887, 6,500 marks in 1888 and 7,300 marks in 1889. This insufficient support is all the more regrettable as the Basel Missionary Society has not received the necessary funds in full for its other major tasks in India, China and on the West African Gold Coast in recent years. The report therefore expresses the justified wish that the other German countries, especially those already associated with the Basel Missionary Society, would also support the Cameroon Mission more vigorously and that those circles that are concerned about German colonialism from a national point of view would also like to participate more in supporting the mission. Despite all internal and external difficulties and dangers, the Protestant mission in Cameroon is progressing very well. May the willingness to make sacrifices at home not lag behind the willingness to work and the courage to die of the missionaries in that dangerous country, where five Basel missionaries have already sunk into the grave in the last three years, so that there is not ultimately only a lack of resources, to expand the mission in the landlocked country, which is more open and receptive to it, and especially to establish the urgently needed health station in the Cameroon Mountains for the recovery and recuperation of the missionaries who are so often afflicted by the dangerous climatic fever in Cameroon and on the Gold Coast. The association's accountant is now Mr. Klaiber, a former member of the Finance Council in Stuttgart, Olgastrasse 69 C, who, along with the other representatives of the association, accepts membership applications and contributions for the association. (Togo area.) Dutiable goods were imported into the Togo area from April 1 to October 1, 1889: Rum (under 40 percent) 440 373 liters,

Page 99

(40-60 percent) 112,172 liters, (over 60 percent) 18,550 liters, genever (in equal percentages) 4,759 and 2435 liters, tobacco 89,726 kilos. Powder 181,679 English hundredweights, guns 2333 pieces. - Of particular interest is the announcement in the German Colonial Gazette that the merchants of Klein-Popo and Porto=Seguro (in the Togo region) have founded a "Chamber of Commerce". - The number of ships that called at the roadstead of Klein=Pepo in 1889 amounted to 96, of which 50 were German. 15 English, 21 Italian and 7 French. - The latest issue of Mitteilungen von Forschungsreisenden und Gelehrten aus den deutschen Schutzgebieten contains a valuable work by Baron Dr. von Danckelmann, which is also of practical importance from the point of view of plantation establishment. The highest temperatures occur in the period from February to April, the lowest in July or August. The rainy seasons are from March to June and from September or October to November. Rainfall is relatively low on the coast, but increases by a factor of two or three towards the interior of the country. Accordingly, the number of days with thunderstorms increases the further inland you go. Thunder was heard at the Bismarcksburg station on 190 days of the last observation year. However, lightning damage is rare. Of particular interest is the description of the domestic tornadoes, i.e. mostly rapidly passing thunderstorm gusts, and the Harmattan, which blows periodically in the period from early November to mid-March, but especially in December and February. - Dr. R. Büttner, who travelled the southern Congo Basin in 1884-1886, has been appointed scientific director of the Bismarckburg station. - (Southwest African protectorate.) The state of health of the crews is excellent, and the influence on the country's recovery cannot be underestimated. Captain v. François visited the bastards of Roboboth at the beginning of December and intended to examine Windhoek, where, owing to the presence of warm springs, cultivations can be made. The complete organization of the Verg authority is in prospect. The Vergassessor Frielinghaus has entered the service of the Reich as mining captain and head of the authority. He is still in Rohobeth with the Bastards; he will be joined by a suitable technician as surveyor, who will leave for Southwest Africa shortly. - Dr. Göring has probably already been in the protectorate for several weeks. During his stay in Cape Town, a number of English sondicates approached him to obtain permission to carry out mining investigations for the German protectorate. - The steamer of the New Guinea Company, "Ottilie", which arrived from Finschbasen in Cooltown in mid-February, reports on the remarkable progress of tadak cultivation in Kaiser Wilhelmsland. Tobacco is said to be thriving well and the successes achieved so far in this direction are such that an expedition is to set off for the Kaiserin Augusta River in the near future, specifically for the purpose of scouting the banks of the river for further stretches of land suitable for tobacco cultivation. (Emin Pasha's entry into German service) has caused great annoyance in England and our compatriot has not been spared the harshest reproaches, which are of course quite unjust. But Emin Pasha, as the English do not seem to know, saw through their plan from the very beginning, as can be seen from the following excerpt from a forthcoming work by P. A. Schynse, which was wedged into the "Kölnische Zeitung", when he writes: "I am chatting most of the way with Emin Pasha, who makes no secret of the actual purpose of the expedition. How could a grizzled Scottish merchant (Mackinnon, who gave a lot of money for Stanley's expedition) suddenly think of spending large sums of money to get out an Egyptian official whom he may not even have known by name? This expedition was not so much for Dr. Emin Pasha as for his province and his ivory. If conditions had remained as they were, the 4000 hundredweight of ivory lying in Wadelal would have amply covered the expedition costs and also provided a fund for several years. In the meantime, Emin Pasha would have collected new ivory, thus annexing a beautiful province free of charge and gaining the means to connect it with Mombassa. If Emin Pasha had been given the chance, he would have put his influence and knowledge of the country at the service of his liberators, and the whole thing would have been a successful commercial speculation. "I am quite grateful to the gentlemen for what they have done for me," concluded Dr. Emin Pasha, "but the ultimate purpose of the expedition had already become clear to me when I had my first conversation with Stanley. Even if he did not make any direct suggestions to me, I immediately sensed that there was something else behind it than the simple desire to bring home a few Egyptian officials." Among Stanley's own lieutenants, the same opinion was dispersed: "In our many dealings with the officers of the expedition, many things come through which clearly show what the expedition's purposes were. To all outward appearances it was a success and will be celebrated accordingly in Eurepa; in reality, however, the heroes of the expedition are quite dissatisfied with the results and admit this here today. "A lot of people have died, considerable resources have been spent, we have lived in misery for 2½ years and what have we achieved? We bring a number of useless, rotten Egyptian scribes, Jews, Greeks, Turks from the Jnner, who do not even thank us for it; Casati himself was not worth the trouble, he has become Mchenzi, and the Pasha is indeed a nobleman, but only a man of science." One had counted on finding in Dr. Emin Pasha a soldier at the head of 2,000 disciplined men, to whom one need only bring ammunition in order to secure the equatorial province for England and, with the help of his bayonnet, to open a way to Mombassa. Now that this has not been achieved, they are dissatisfied. Dr. Emin Pasha himself is enough of a connoisseur of human nature to have no illusions about the true motives of the expedition." (The new Colonial Department of the Foreign Office), which was approved by the budget for 1890/91, can now be considered to have been formed. At its head is the director, as the newly elected title reads, Privy Legation Councillor Dr. Krauel, who is assisted by Privy Legation Councillor Dr. Rettich. The department also includes two senior officials, the former Reichskommissar for the Marshall Islands, Sonnenschein, and the court assessor v. Koenig, who was previously attached to the Consulate General in London. (A description of the gala and interim uniforms for the imperial officials used in the protectorates tops the first issue of the official German colonial newspaper. (From the Congo.) At Übanghi, the chief of the Banji station (under the 4th degree north of Br.) was ambushed and murdered by the Bond'sos together with a few more Lapiots. This unpleasant event prompted the Revue Frangaise to make the following statement, which puts the boldest plans of our colonial friends, derisively called "colonial fanatics" by their opponents, in the shade: "Towards the west, we cannot cross the 12° 40° E. L., the border agreed with Germany, but to the east we can freely extend to the right bank of the Ubangbi north of the border of the Congo State and thus reach the aquatorial province on the Oder Nile, which until recently was claimed by Emin Pasha! (The Belletie de la Société des Etudes Coloniales et Maritimos), following our articles on securing the German sphere of interest, publishes a longer work by Baron R. Michel, the Secretary General of the Society: "Les Allemands et les Anglais dans le Centre de l'Afrique." In general, the comments are factual, but we would like to correct the view that "the German Colonial Society, as everyone knows, was inspired, founded and supported on a large scale by Mr. von Bismarck". To our regret, the latter is by no means the case. At the end, the author puts forward the strange hypothesis that, while the English are striving for a connection from south to north, the Germans are striving for one from east to west. He urges the French government to study the prodlem, which he breaks down from the French point of view into the following parts: "Shall we wish that Germany should not reach the Great Lakes, however considerable the advantage to England of possessing an uninterrupted trade route over the whole length of Africa! On the contrary, should we wish this great line to be broken in the middle, even though this results in the German possessions coming closer to our Congo territory!" Frankly, we do not understand the fears of the French. Doesn't the Congo state count for anything and aren't we the best neighbors of the Schiregediet in West Africa?) The "Journal do Commercio" publishes a declaration by the Makololos on December 8, in which they apologize and return to the Portuguese all the lands that were previously granted to them. The declaration also states that the Makololos had been driven to revolt by the commander of the Ryassa region. - (Anti-Slavery Conference.) As far as the proceedings of the Brussels African Conference can be surveyed so far, the conference treaty will on the whole contain five sections, namely: 1. general provisions; 2. means of eradicating the slave trade by land; 3. means of preventing the slave trade by sea; 4. abolition of the Asiatic slave markets; and 5. means of supervising the above-mentioned regulations. (German Colonization Society.) Last year, in No. 7 of the "Deutsche Kolonialzeitung", we took the opportunity, on the basis of information we had received and the prospectus, to warn vigorously against participation in this enterprise envisaged for South America. The consequence of this was that a journal published by this society attacked the German Colonial Society in the most vehement manner, without it having seemed necessary for us to react against it. We had completely lost sight of the Society until we were reminded of it in the mailbox of an issue sent to us. In it, the former Secretary General of the Society, Captain (ret.) Schobert, is requested by F. W. Kreling, "Liquidator of the German Colonization Society", to hand over a number of documents or else face legal action. Literature. Kordensklöld's voyage around Asia and Europe. Nordenskiöld's report edited for other circles by E. Erman. Second edition with 200 illustrations, a portrait and a map. Leipzig, F., A. Brock haus. 1890. The author has undertaken with decided luck to make Nordensklöld's work "Die Umiegelung Asiens und Eurepas auf der Vega", published in 1881, accessible to the general public by following the author's reports as faithfully as possible, abridging them on the one hand and expanding, supplementing and enlivening them with descriptions by other younger members of the expedition on the other. Mr. Erman first gives us a brief outline of Nordenskiöld's life and an overview of his earlier polar voyages, then describes the various attempts to find the northeastern passage since 1553, before moving on to the finally successful northern circumnavigation of Europe and Asia, which also includes Japan, Hong Kong and Ceylon. The accompanying illustrations are excellent. We

must, for lack of space, refrain from going into more detail about the work; anyone interested in the polar countries will certainly not hesitate to purchase this highly recommended work. China. Sketches of the country and its people with special consideration of commercial conditions by A. H. Exner, former delegate of the Deutsche Bank in the German railroad consortium for China. With a portrait in steel engraving, 6 lithographic color prints, 17 autotypical illustrations, a plan of the city of Peking, etc. Leipzig, T. O. Mr. Exner was one of the three delegates sent to China by the German Railway Consortium in 1886 to study the railroad issue and other conditions in the country on the spot. Under these circumstances, the author was able to gain a deeper insight into them than was possible for other travelers who were not supported by weighty recommendations and the support of influential personalities. Even if the special purpose for which the journey was undertaken gives the work a special character, in that the mercantile circumstances have been taken into account in a very special and painstaking way, the author also presents the reader with a splendid picture of Chinese life. The author visited Canton and Shangdal, traveled 600 (English) miles up the Hangtsekian, was received in audience in Tiensin by the intelligent Viceroy of Chuli, Li=Hung=Chang, and spent a long time in Peling, from where he also paid a visit to the famous Great Wall of China. In addition to the interesting description of the city and country, Exner has also managed to observe the whole of Chinese life in detail, although he has found the best support everywhere. The accompanying illustrations are excellent, but the addition of a map would be very welcome. The work should make a considerable contribution to correcting the many erroneous views that prevail about the distant wonderland of China. Entrances for the library. Given the limited space we have for book reviews, it will not be possible to discuss all works in detail, but we never fail to recommend new colonial writings, which are assigned to our library by the authors and publishers, to colonial friends in word and deed, for which the administration of the library is given ample opportunity by our members. Once again, we would like to express our sincere thanks for the books donated to our library. Receipts in March. Altona, House, Historical development of Lower Löndisch=Judia.

The borders of German East Africa. As a result of the suggestion made by the Berlin Congo Conference, the development of the system of "spheres of interest" of the various powers involved in Africa has begun, and a delimitation of these has been undertaken, which, unfortunately, has only taken place up to certain points towards the interior. With a few exceptions, the borders have been fairly precisely defined in terms of the neighboring spheres of interest, but since they remained undefined for all parties involved in the interior, this omission laid the foundation for manifold disputes and gave all parties involved the opportunity to make up for what they had neglected. England, which had perhaps contributed most at the time to keeping the internal borders up in the air, set about taking the greatest possible advantage of this. It began its campaign against the claims of other nations by attacking little Portugal and seeking to bring the Anglo-Portuguese border dispute in East Africa to a head. It began sabre-rattling, but eventually took the diplomatic route in a somewhat less hot-blooded manner, and the matter is still not settled today. German developments in East Africa have always been a thorn in the side of the British, but even if they watched Germany's growing successes in Africa with ever greater jealousy and concern, it was much more difficult to do anything directly damaging to our interests given the officially good relations between the two powers. As always in such cases, it was English private entrepreneurs who took matters into their own hands, as the British government had already refused all direct involvement years ago. It should be clear what we are talking about here: the English Emin Pasha company. However, the British government did not refrain from entering on principle, not because it had no intention of expanding its territory, but because it knew exactly what the British Emin Pasha Committee, headed by Mackinnon, the director of the British East African Company, wanted. The author himself was able to provide information about Emin and Stanley in a recent lecture based on a letter from the general representative of the German-East African Society, Mr. v. St. Paul-Illaire, who had sent it to his father. Through him they also came to the attention of His Majesty the Emperor. The letter itself reads: Emin was in Zanzibar with my son at the beginning of March. He complained bitterly that Stanley had made disparaging remarks about him in the newspapers, and especially that Stanley had denied that Emin could have been persuaded to leave Wadelai with idm only after Stanley had offered him 12,000 pounds sterling. After Stanley had said this, he (Emin) would no longer remain silent, but would tell my son exactly what Stanley had offered him: 1. Stanley offered on behalf of the King of the Belgians: Emin enters the service of the Congo State as a general, determines his own salary, remains governor of his province and receives 12,000 pounds sterling as administrative expenses, which he must however raise in ivory rc. in the province itself 2. Stanley has offered on behalf of the British East African Company and added that he advises Emin Pasha to prefer this second proposal to the former: Emin gathers all the military force he can muster, 3-4-5000 men, accompanies Stanley west and south around the Victoria=Nvanza, settles in Kawirondo and establishes several stations. Meanwhile Stanley goes down through Massailand to Mombassa, from there he brings up two dismountable steamers to Kawirondo for Emin. After these are afloat on Lake Victoria, Emin conquers Uganda and Unvoro. He founds a new province there and expands northwards, i.e. towards his former territory. Emin now becomes the fully independent governor of this new province with a salary to be agreed in the service of the British East African Company. So the British Company in Mombassa and Emin Pasha north of Lake Victoria! However, it only took one direct railroad up there to paralyze Germany forever. Our Lord has arranged things differently. Stanley's intentions, and thus those of his sponsors, are thus precisely prefigured, and everything that the English are now doing to soften the impression of these revelations, which are very unwelcome to them, only proves how much they have lost with the failure of their plans. The English government, which would only have fully supported the assertion of the claims of the English "trading company", which the alleged rescue of Emin Pasha turned out to be, if the acquisition of Emin's territories had been successful, has saved itself great inconvenience with its restraint. The anger of the English at the failure of their trade speculation is all the greater as they not only have to lament this very failure, but have also contributed to making it possible for Germany to take this excellent force into its service through the "rescue" of Emin himself. Emin has already been in German service since March 6, so the view that the knowledge of Stanley's offers to Emin helped to induce our Emperor is refuted. Emin to enlist for German service. Of course, as always in such cases, the most peculiar combinations are made about Emin's mission, indeed, a kind of Argonaut move is fabulated, as if Germany now wanted to take over Stanley's role in order to gain possession of the former Egyptian governor's ivory stocks. That can in no way be the purpose of such an expedition. The first object will be to occupy Tabora and bring the Arabs of the interior to a better understanding, i.e. to convince them that a continued hostile attitude on their part towards Germany is useless to them. Who would be better suited for this than Emin, who combines all the qualities that the Arabs of the East Coast unite in the expression "taratibu" and which can best be translated as the American "smart" (literally meaning cautious)? It can be assumed that Emin also has another mission. In any case, he will make acquisitions. At first, probably only within our sphere of interest, which has been expressly recognized by England as far as Tanganyika, namely in the Blue Book of 1888. The German government has given reassuring explanations to the English regarding Emin's expedition, unsolicited, which always has the advantage that one has a large

Page 102

effect without having to answer questions, which can often be very uncomfortable. Sir Fergusson, the English Under-Secretary of State, recently spoke on the subject in the English House of Commons as follows: With regard to the report that a German expedition is about to set out for Central Africa, in a direction likely to be prejudicial to British interests, I am happy to inform you that the German Government, without being asked, has assured Her Majesty's Government that the expedition under Emin Pasha has the sole object of operating within the German sphere of influence, and of not prejudicing British interests at all, as the German Government fully recognizes the demarcation made, which reserves to each Power a sphere of influence. I believe that two Powers in the position of Germany and Great Britain have never co-operated with more perfect cordiality and greater absence of friction between the Governments and the officials employed than has recently been the case on the part of the two Powers mentioned. I am quite sure that to the extent that the Denian Government relies on us, we can rely on them not to take any steps that might harm our interests. We take great interest in the region of Lake Nyassa and Lake Tanganpika, because of the operations of some of the noblest British subjects. No definite arrangements have been made in regard to this region, but the House may rest assured that the British interests would be protected and watched over, and that they would not be endangered by the conduct of our allies, who throughout this affair have manifested such perfect love and regard for our interests. But this is by no means a binding declaration. In any case, Emin is free to be active in the areas where no sphere of interest exists for any nation at all, namely in the areas west of the Victoria-Nyanza. Stanley himself had believed that the Lake District fell within the German sphere of interest and even in these days Sir Samuel Baker spoke of the possibility of a German occupation of the realms of Uganda and Unyoro. It would certainly be desirable for the German government to do its utmost to secure these eminently important territories for Germany, and for the border of German East Africa to be formed by an extension of the Umbe-Kilimanjaro-Victoria-Rianza line in a north-westerly direction. Then, however, our interests most imperatively demand that the land between Lake Nyassa and Lake Bangweolo in southern German East Africa should also be definitively included in our sphere of interest. Until now, England has always followed the principle of granting private trading companies charters with the right of sovereignty when making acquisitions. However, Lakes Compaoy on Lake Nyassa does not have such a charter and the territories it claims belong to the colony of Mozambique according to Portuguese opinion. The dispute between Portugal and England broke out over these lands. No one knows by what right England claims these territories and only a few days ago Fergusson himself had to admit that England had no sovereign rights there. Even in the area between the lakes Nyassa, Tanganyika and Bangweolo, England has admittedly never exercised sovereign rights and the construction of the often-cited Stevenson Road between the Tanganyika and Nyassa does not give any right to land acquisition. The company was purely a private matter. Germany also has to take steps there to round off its territory in a way that appears to be an imperative necessity, and we hope that with Emin's entry into German service the first step towards solving the pending questions in the sense we meant has been taken. The English objections that Emin is setting off at an unfavorable time of year are probably just as much to be regarded as scaremongering as the impracticable project of an English expedition from Liberia on the west coast across Africa to Abyssinia on the east coast. The English efforts to forestall Emin's expedition will also be in vain, for Emin will be on his way before the English come to their senses. Even Stanley is likely to lose out to Emin because of his popular approach. The German successes on the east coast have not failed to make an impression either abroad or, more importantly, at home, and soon, we hope, the German flag will fly where our legitimate interests require it. Paul Reichard. Some further proposals for practical colonization in the New Guinea Company's protectorate. By Dr. Richard Hindorf. If for political and practical reasons it was necessary to establish a number of stations in different parts of the protectorate of the New Guinea Company, then this requirement has probably been met by the settlements established so far, and the various stations will initially be sufficient to express German sovereignty on the one hand, and to serve as starting points for the actual establishment and colonization of the country on the other. Perhaps it will prove necessary to establish one station each on the Empress Augusta River and on the Solomon Islands. But these will not merely be costly, unprofitable administrative stations, which unfortunately we could not do without at the beginning, but stations with specific economic purposes and tasks, to be set up with a view to fixed goals that are clearly in our sights. The station on the Solomon Islands, for example, would mainly be a labor station; further new stations would only be established when the need to open up new areas for colonization became apparent; they would then only be the forerunners for the establishment of new plantations. Such precursor stations, or as I would like to call them, "flying observation stations", should always precede the final establishment of a station. Now that we have the necessary time in New Guinea, where there is no reason to overestimate the establishment of new settlements, it would be irresponsible if we did not carefully observe all the given conditions and only make a well-founded choice of location for the settlement after thorough consideration of all the circumstances. When establishing plantations, nothing is so difficult to avenge, and nothing is so difficult to rectify later on, as a wrong choice of location for the first settlement. Don't fool yourself. Spend weeks, even months, searching the land for suitable sites; the effort and expense expended will bear rich fruit later. It is absurd to want to establish planting stations in New Guinea now in such a way that one lands somewhere, makes a short foray inland, finds the land to be good, then disembarks a few Europeans with a number of colored workers and the necessary material, and then starts planting tobacco, coffee or cotton. A one-day expedition is no way to determine whether the land in question meets all requirements as far as possible, and it is especially impossible to select the most suitable piece for the respective purpose from a wide range in such a short time. This requires numerous observations in the most diverse directions, and these can only be collected over a longer period of time. Of course, all these observations are made much easier if the new branch is to be established in the vicinity of existing stations. All the necessary surveys can then be carried out thoroughly and calmly from the latter. If there is no older station nearby, a "flying observation station" should always and under all circumstances be sent ahead. The name already indicates that it should not be a fixed, permanent installation; it must be easily movable and therefore must not be equipped and weighed down with too much material. In the area where the new settlement is to take place, such a station is set up at a point that seems suitable. The search of the land for suitable sites for the subsequent main settlement begins immediately, without being held up by time-consuming installation work. In view of the purpose of the new installation, the head of the station must subject all conditions to a thorough, objective examination, draw simple sketches of the areas traversed, enter the watercourses, heights, angles of inclination, soil conditions, etc., and make as many notes as possible which may be of value for a later comparative assessment of the various lines. This observation station may have to be moved a few kilometers if there is no suitable land nearby. From the outset, appropriate meteorological observations should be made and these should be followed by regular surveys of the water level conditions in the existing watercourses. It is particularly important to determine the wind conditions; these are all too often neglected and the damage this causes to the growers is often very significant. The wind is not only a dangerous enemy to the tender tobacco leaves, which are torn apart by the wind, but it also causes great damage to strong trees; there are only a few cultivated plants in the tropics (coconut palms) that are not virtually destroyed by persistent wind. Thus one sees everywhere in tropical plantations extensive mountain slopes, carefully planted and maintained, but the little trees (be it coffee, tea, cocoa, cinchona, etc.) are miserable and stunted, one searches in vain for fruit and the cause? Only the wind! For close by, in places that are protected from the wind, the little trees grow luxuriantly and joyfully, while the trees that the wind shakes mercilessly for months are finally subject to rough treatment. - If the wind

Page 103

The conditions of a plantation can only be definitively determined by years of observation, but even a short period of observation can provide important information, and above all, important clues can be gleaned from the effects of the wind on the forest trees, on creepers, on grassy areas, on the banana leaves in the plantations of the natives, and so on. Life on such an observation station is strenuous and exhausting; but the future manager of the new plantation to be established will gladly undergo all these efforts, because this is the only sure way for him to choose the most suitable place for his plantation, and he will rather make do in a tent and under corrugated iron sheets for a few weeks longer than choose the place for the establishment at random. After the site for the new plantation has finally been selected on the basis of the most careful examination, the observation station sets up at this location and begins the preparatory work for the later establishment. First of all, houses and sheds are to be built for the following Europeans, colored workers and for the supplies; this has the tremendous advantage that the main mass of workers is not placed unprotected in the jungle, but finds accommodation immediately, which not only saves a lot of time, but also strongly prevents all possible diseases; the food supply can be better organized from the outset, the supplies are less likely to be damaged, in short, the whole establishment and installation of the new station is infinitely easier if the necessary preparations for the subsequent main troop have been made through such an observation station. Of course, the new facilities in New Guinea will have to have a different character than the previous administrative stations. The latter were and are naturally costly and their profitability could not initially be expected. Now it will be a matter of setting up new enterprises, either independently or attached to the existing stations; enterprises whose purposes are purely economic and whose most important aim must be to "make money". The fertility of the soil in New Guinea, the climate, the abundance of water, the high altitude and all other conditions indicate that the main means of developing this colony is to be found in the introduction of extensive tropical agriculture. Trade cannot be of importance at first because there is nothing to export; we know nothing about the existence of easily exploitable natural resources. The establishment of tropical plantations, on the other hand, offers every prospect of success, and this is where we must use our strength; but great things cannot be expected with small means and little daring; we must begin to work with all our strength in New Guinea, because not much has been achieved yet, and there is much to catch up on. The establishment of numerous plantations in New Guinea and the creation of an extensive plantation business must therefore be promoted as much as possible. There are two reasons for this: on the one hand, New Guinea can only prosper, only become a flourishing colony, if export values are generated there through agriculture; on the other hand, the plantations in New Guinea will be able to yield abundant returns to their owners, and it is therefore urgently desired that German capital be invested there in profitable ventures. The New Guinea Company alone cannot accomplish the enormous task of establishing numerous and extensive plantations of all kinds in New Guinea in a short time, and of bringing about tropical agriculture of the necessary extent there, and German big capital must therefore participate actively in the execution of this extensive work. The New Guinea Company is proceeding in a gratifying manner to increase and expand its agricultural facilities, and it can be sure of success if it works in the right way. It would only be desirable for it to establish large plantations on an even more extensive scale, so that it can finally generate income from the expected abundant returns; for truly, it is time that the large and constant expenditure could finally be matched by some income. It is also the New Guinea Company's duty to introduce crops, or to set up facilities that do not immediately yield a direct monetary benefit, but which are indispensable for colonization in New Guinea; I mention here as an example the introduction of rice culture. But here a tremendous change must take place! German big business must undertake plantation building in New Guinea with large funds. After all, significant German capital is invested in numerous agricultural ventures in other colonies. In Delhi, on Sumatra's west coast, in Java and Borneo, German capital is invested in agricultural ventures; only recently have German companies asked for significant stretches of land on some of the small Sunda Islands; the German Sunda Company is launching agricultural ventures on South Vorneo with German money - all the more reason to hope that our rich and fertile possessions in New Guinea will be remembered and that German capital will soon begin to create profitable plantations there as well. And why, for example, is Borneo preferred to the beautiful Kaiser=Wilhelmsland? The prospects for success are the same in both areas, for here and there we are dealing with lush, rich, but as yet unexplored strips; the labor question is almost exactly the same in New Guinea as in Borneo; it is difficult to solve, but it is not an insurmountable obstacle for capital-strong entrepreneurs. Or should the planter perhaps be able to move more freely under the Dutch government than in New Guinea? Should he be afraid of being too restricted by the numerous laws and regulations of the New Guinea Company? I almost believe that this fear, more than any other concern, prevented German capital from being invested in New Guinea. But I very much doubt that this fear is still justified. I am convinced that the New Guinea Company, correctly recognizing the fact that it needs the support and cooperation of German capital for its colonization work, and in full appreciation of the advantage that foreign capital investments in New Guinea bring it, is prepared to promote and support German economic ventures in New Guinea in every way. And that a good future can be predicted for the plantation business in New Guinea, if it is set up and managed in the right way, is beyond doubt for me, who has had the opportunity to compare New Guinea with the richest tropical countries, with Java, Sumatra and Ceylon. I therefore urgently recommend once again that German capital step out of the restraint it has hitherto maintained and begin planting in Nen Guinea, for its own profit and to the advantage of our valuable possessions in the South Seas. I have already said before that the little man, the individual settler (i.e. European) with little capital, cannot yet find a livelihood in New Guinea. It will probably be quite some time before that happens. Initially, only the investments of well-funded entrepreneurs have a secure prospect of prospering. Only when there are already flourishing plantations, when values are produced, seduced and shipped, when ways and means of transportation are necessary and numerous needs of the white planters and their coloured workers are to be satisfied, will other Europeans find a place, even with limited means, in connection with such starting points of colonization. At first, of course, this development will be slow, but it will be all the faster the sooner and the more export values are produced, thus making trade possible. And here, too, it will become apparent that united forces lead to the goal. A number of plantations, spread over the wide protected area, will each have a favourable effect in its own circle and promote the work of colonization, but the overall result would be far more favourable if these plantations were initially all united in a moderately wide area. For only a certain number of plantations would be sufficient to provide some craftsmen, carters and traders with a secure livelihood; the construction of roads, bridges and harbor facilities would be spread over several enterprises, the catering of the workers, the procurement of all consumer goods would be easier and cheaper; easier medical assistance, mutual support in times of need and danger, a more lively social intercourse, all these and many other things are advantages of the concentration of plantations. And if such a starting point is created somewhere in the protected area, where work is carried out with significant resources from the outset, the colonization work will progress more easily and make greater progress from here than if work were to be started at too many points at the same time. It therefore seems to me that one of the most important conditions for the success of the undertakings in New Guinea is that in future the work should be concentrated on a few points, perhaps even on one point at first, that a colonization center should be created from which the colonization work can then be extended in wider and wider circles. By this I do not mean that the existing stations should be neglected, no, they may continue their work, but new enterprises, especially plantations, should be established in a single, not too extensive area if possible. Of course, the first and most important issue is to choose the most suitable starting point for this work. The place from which the colonization work is to begin must be chosen in each area.

The harbor must meet all the requirements. A good harbor must make it easy to ship the produce; the harbor should have a rich, fertile, extensive hinterland, partly lowland, with mountains within easy reach, if possible of volcanic origin, suitable for all mountain crops and for the establishment of health stations. The climate, especially the distribution of rainfall, as well as the winds must be such that they favor plantation cultivation; there should be suitable soil and plenty of water for rice cultivation. - These are the first conditions to be met by the area to be selected. Unfortunately, it is not possible to determine in advance whether an area is healthy. The presence of navigable watercourses and good timber stocks is very desirable. If the area in question is well populated, so much the better, but we are dependent on the introduction of workers everywhere in New Guinea; nowhere is the existing population sufficient for extensive plantation operations, so that the weak population of a line need not deter us from taking it up. And do we have areas in New Guinea that meet all the requirements? Without a doubt! In the Huong Gulf, especially in the vicinity of the Markham River, on New Pomerania, probably also on New Mecklenburg and the Solomon Islands, but above all in Astrolabe Bay, we have extensive tracts of land that we would hardly find more suitable for our purposes in other colonies. I am convinced that Astrolabebai is the most suitable starting point for an extensive and successful exploration of the country. Already in 1887 I spoke out in favor of Astrolabebai in a similar sense, and before and since then numerous visitors to New Guinea have likewise declared the land around Astrolabebai to be one of the best parts of the protected area. All the more reason, I hope, to attach some weight to this opinion. Yes, I am sure that Astrolabebai will become the economic center of our South Seas possessions, and therefore I would like to repeat the advice I gave three years ago to move the main station from Finschhafen to Astrolabebai. The advantages of Astrolabebai are manifold. All around it stretches a belt of flat, fertile land, usually several kilometers wide; numerous rivers and streams flow down from the mountains behind it, to the north of the bai we have the wide, deep Astrolabe plain, and even further north, at a moderate distance, the beautiful, large Friedrich=Wilhelmshafen, one of the best in the protectorate, the natural shipping port of these rich areas. And through the Astrolabe Plain we have easy access to the extensive mountains surrounding it, on which all mountain cultures promise good success. The Hansemann Mountains, at a short distance from Friedrich=Wilhelmshafen, will provide cool, airy and healthy dwellings on its slopes for the numerous Europeans who will certainly be drawn to Friedrich=Wilhelmshafen in the not too distant future for official or business reasons; There are rich stocks of wood everywhere, the coast of Astrolabebai is richly populated, and what is also very much in Astrolabebai's favor is that there are already two stations of the New Guinea Company there, as well as two mission stations, so a significant start has been made and something will be achieved there all the more quickly. We are only informed about the climate by our observations in Constantine Harbour; there the climate is favorable to plantation cultivation; for the northern part of the Bai, the climate will hardly differ significantly as far as the lowlands are concerned; and the mountains are so numerous and rise to such significant heights that it will certainly be possible to find wind-sheltered beaches with favorable rainfall on them. The crowding together of many plantations in a limited space does not make it more difficult to obtain labor for them, for experience has shown that the labor output of the villages adjacent to the stations is extraordinarily low, and one must therefore always import all workers from other regions. We will never succeed in persuading individual Malays or even individual families to settle permanently in New Guinea if they do not have the certainty that a larger number of their fellow tribesmen will soon do the same. Only if we can settle them in larger communities, if they can build Malay villages as they did in their homeland, if we give them sawas (rice fields) as they have at home, and bushes to cultivate them, in short, if we organize New Guinea for them in such a way that they do not miss their old homeland, only then will the imported Malays be inclined to settle permanently in New Guinea. Therefore, if a start is to be made with Malay colonization, do not begin at several points, but bring all Malay settlers and workers together in one place and try to make them feel at home there. And if we succeed in establishing the first Malay settlement, this will also attract further immigrants, and it is to be hoped that the people who originally only came as workers for a certain period of time will decide to stay longer or to settle permanently. But let us not deceive ourselves: it will not be easy for us to persuade Malayans to leave their homeland permanently, and it will take a great deal of skill and precise knowledge of the Malay people to achieve this goal. Those people who decide to settle permanently should be helped in every way; they must be well off so that they do not long to return home. Each family should be given a small house of their own, a few coconut palms and some garden land, and especially one should not be too sparing with the paddy fields, but allocate a considerable piece of sawa to each family: for rich paddy fields are the pride of the Malay, they are his greatest wealth, and the wealth and importance of the owner is estimated according to their extent. At this point I would like to discuss in more detail the importance of rice cultivation for our South Sea possessions. I see one of the most urgent and immediate tasks of the New Guinea Company in introducing rice cultivation in New Guinea. Not as if the necessary foodstuffs could not be procured in other ways for the time being (and perhaps even more cheaply than our own rice cultivation would initially cost). For example, all the rice for the tobacco regions in East Fumatra is still being imported from abroad. But in the long run New Guinea cannot be dependent on foreign countries for its foodstuffs; sooner or later it would have to switch to growing what it needs in the country itself; and soon its own cultivation will be cheaper than imports. And there is no doubt that New Guinea, with its soil and water, will become a rice country, just as good as India, China and the Indian islands. Without rice fields it will be in vain to attempt the settlement of Malays or Indians; one can import workers from there, and also the rice to feed them; but the Malays and Indians can only be settled if one is able to give them rice fields of their own. It is a mistake to believe that the cultivation of food for us and our workers in New Guinea can be left entirely to the diligence and industriousness of the natives, and that they will gradually come to build the necessary food for our workers; they can indeed be brought to build beyond their own needs, but we will never be able to rely on them for the supply of food for the workers. And it is even less likely that the natives would easily turn to rice cultivation. Indeed, even Malay settlers introduced by us would probably only very slowly achieve reasonably extensive rice cultivation on their own initiative and with their own resources. The establishment of larger rice fields is no easy task. The construction and terracing of the soil, the construction of often very long ditches for irrigation and drainage, the construction of numerous dams, the correct measurement of the amount of water to be supplied, all this requires so much work and capital, so much perseverance and practical technical knowledge that we must necessarily come to the aid of the colored people. Or, to put it more clearly, we must work together with colored people who have already cultivated rice in the past, for they are excellent at all the necessary work, and we have only to guide them, to support them with our willpower, with our capital, now and then with our rivellir= and measuring instruments, and we will then soon arrive at extensive rice fields. A corresponding part of the rice fields must soon be transferred to the Malay immigrants, who will then gradually have to pay off the costs incurred and, in time, become the real owners. Whether the New Guinea Company should then continue rice cultivation itself or lease the fields to white or colored entrepreneurs depends on the circumstances. In Java, India and America, rice cultivation is often carried out by whites with success and advantage on a large scale; why should it not be worthwhile later in New Guinea, with cheap labor? However, initially one will only have to work for one's own needs. This much is certain, the introduction of rice cultivation in New Guinea

Page 105

The first steps must be taken by the New Guinea Company by starting to plant rice fields itself. Rice will gradually become the cheapest foodstuff in New Guinea. In addition, pams, the main crop of the South Sea islands, will probably retain a certain importance. But numerous other crops deserve attention for New Guinea, on the one hand because rice only thrives where there is heavy soil and plenty of water, and on the other hand because the population needs other fruits for variety and a thriving diet. In addition to pams, the preferred crops are potatoes, taro and manioc, as well as bananas, millet, durrha, maize, beans and peanuts. The last three crops mentioned are particularly important because their protein and fat content make them a suitable supplement to the one-sided starchy rice diet. Whether the cultivation of these crops will generally be worthwhile for the white man in New Guinea is doubtful to me; it is to be warned against cultivating foodstuffs if one could procure them or a suitable substitute more cheaply elsewhere; however, one can make an assumption of this if it is a matter of introducing a crop new to New Guinea, familiarizing the natives with the planting and use of the same, and encouraging them to cultivate it. And especially now in the beginning, it is an important task to teach our colored subjects, who are so poor in good, high-yielding crops, new plants whose cultivation is suitable for them. German emigration. (Conclusion. Wherever a serious representation of German interests is required, the German government can no longer do without a paid official who is dependent on it. With the rapidly increasing growth of German interests abroad, it will only be a matter of a very short time before the German government allows professional civil servants to represent it in most places. As far as help and advice are concerned, whereby the German emigrant should receive more support from our consuls in the future, the activities of the free associations for the protection of German immigrants already existing abroad should be taken as a basis for the assessment of what is necessary for this. Our domestic governments will be aware of the more or less beneficial effectiveness of such associations, especially in South and North America, and through their representatives they would be able to judge most easily and most reliably where interest groups have joined such associations that are likely to influence their effectiveness to the detriment of German immigrants. This may not happen too often, but the monitoring by our Reich organs will still have its benefits. On the other hand, there are many forms in which the German settler abroad falls prey to foreign exploitation; these dangers require comprehensive investigations; once these have been completed in detail, it will be possible to find ways and means of taking action against them. We will now discuss the state support that should be given to those undertakings that are directly aimed at promoting and increasing the export trade or at German colonization abroad. The great importance of the greatest possible development of domestic industrial production as the best employer for the country as a whole is sufficient justification for state support to achieve this goal. Increasing our production, however, requires that we increase our sales abroad. This can be supported by improving the means of transportation to these countries and facilitating the terms of payment. In both relationships, the German Colonial Association has indicated the ways in which we can reach our goal. Thus the establishment of German steamship lines supported by imperial funds was advocated by it as a necessary condition of the new economic policy. This memorable day, on which the first imperial mail steamer sailed for East Asia, marked a turning point in German economic history. It will not be long before the good fruits of this and similar state support for good German transport opportunities with foreign countries become visible. The work of the German Colonial Association also had a particularly stimulating effect on the second, no less important task, the facilitation of payment terms. A very important resolution was passed at the General Assembly on April 30, 1886, which will bring lasting glory to the association and its patrons. It read as follows: "The Association considers the establishment of an overseas organization to be a suitable means of supporting German export trade, stimulating the German spirit of enterprise abroad and disseminating the German economy, which is destined to be a means of promoting our transatlantic trade. In the expert justification of this resolution by Consul Annecke, it was very convincingly demonstrated that Germany still makes most of its payments in overseas trade through England's intermediary, which is not only very costly, but also often causes serious difficulties for German trade. A no less alarming consequence of the present state of affairs is that the foreign mediation of shipping, with all the branches of business connected with it, such as the insurance business, is impaired in its natural state. An overseas German bank would make the payment service cheaper and free us from English mediation; but furthermore (and this moment also shows how important the matter can become for German emigration) it must be one of its noblest tasks that it seeks to bring profit-promising ventures abroad, such as railroad construction, port facilities, bridge building and the like, into German hands and attract capital for them. As the speaker rightly emphasized, only a bank over whose management the Reich has a certain influence will meet such requirements. The establishment of an overseas bank is still mainly a pious wish today; the attempts of individual private banks have not been able to meet the needs, so that state assistance still appears useful, indeed necessary. However, we do not want to forget, above the prospect of state aid, that it must be the task of the private cultural and economic factors of our people, above all, to develop the means and ways to support life. State subsidies should not create the foundations for new livelihoods in the first place, but should be granted where the driving forces of the people need them for their healthy development. But this is also the situation today. The capital and manpower that are too abundant in the fatherland only require state protection to prevent them from being absorbed by foreign rationality; it is therefore not a question of founding new livelihoods, but of preserving existing forces, of combining and utilizing them We would like to preface the examination of the question of what the tasks are that fall to the economic circles of our people themselves in the new development with the sentence: the extensive cultural development is causally less a national than a question of capital and interests. In his witty essay on German colonization, Hübbe=Schleiden blamed the slowness with which the world position of Germanness is gaining in trade and commerce on the ageing generation, the weak-willed generation; he foresees the financial and cultural downfall of our nation if the old economy should continue. This fearfulness seems to be somewhat exaggerated, because the historical course of development that our nation and its cultural and economic development have taken contradict the view of a weak-willed ageing generation. In reality, we have our elders to thank for the foundations on which we younger people can confidently and with good hope of success pursue our work outside. The unification of our nation, our developed national prestige and the efficiency of our industry are to be regarded as the pure creations of our elders. Even our sharp-eyed and well-informed Wappäus taught that a German colonization enterprise (which we have to regard as the outward expression of extensive cultural development) depends above all on the right combination of capital and labour. At the same time, however, he also proved that in the sixties we still lacked the capital to harness the surplus labor force. Today this is easier for us, as we also have a lot of capital in Germany that can no longer find a suitable use in the home country. "There was no lack of warm German hearts," says the same scholar in another place, "long before the rise of the German nation in the sixties, which gave room to the idea of taking possession of suitable countries for German emigration, but the realization stood in the way of difficulties that were perhaps not insurmountable *) Cf. D. K.=Z. 1886. p. 322 flg 2) Hamburg, published by L. Friederichsen u. Co. 1881.

but which prevented us from concentrating all available resources on a favorable case. What domestic government could have offered sufficient protection to the German settlers, provided that the capital strength and productive capacity of our domestic industry had been sufficient to derive similar advantages from colonizing ventures, which led England and the United States, for example, to rival for the possession of California. "*) Thanks to the successful efforts of our ancestors, all the foundations for colonizing activities are in place today, and further developing what has been handed down belongs to the present and the future. We may trust that the expansion of our culture and economy will naturally develop from their ability and strength; the latter will form the necessary new interest groups for the new economic organization, which will certainly find the state protection they deserve alongside the existing ones. The transition from an intensive to an extensive culture has also proceeded with some slowness in other countries; and even there there has been no lack of internal opposition to the introduction of their overseas economy. For example, the merchants in Amsterdam, who had favored trade with Lisbon, opposed direct shipping to the East Indies because they feared the destruction of their Lisbon business. And if so little is done today by our overseas trade in Hamburg and Bremen to help alleviate the diseases of overcrowding with unemployed workers and capital, as Roscher aptly describes our economic crisis, this is due to the lack of direct interest; we find the driving factors in the capitalist and industrial circles initially affected by the red state. It is quite undoubted that German industry was the first and foremost pioneer in the introduction of extensive culture, which not only expanded German trade but, what is incomparably more important, has already substantially expanded the German economic and consumer area. In the Rhenish (and many other) districts of the textile industry, there is probably no place where there is not a large number of men who have had to create the basis for their sales in foreign countries with the greatest effort and at considerable business risk. These also have a much greater interest than the merchants of the seaside towns in the German capital, which is also in need of expansion, joining them in overseas countries for extended colonizing ventures, since this would have to increase the consumption of German products and there is no other prospect than to obtain a direct supply of raw materials in this way. In this respect, German companies can achieve great things abroad. Jannasch has numerically demonstrated the importance of raw materials for the English market and trade, and has shown how the concentration of raw materials in England ensures first-hand purchasing advantages for the industry there, while the competition on the continent is dependent on the mediation of agents and commission agents. Jannasch rightly concludes that, since the English raw materials markets must at the same time bring English trade profitable exports of domestic industrial goods, the greater ability to consume, because of the associated secure sales, in turn makes shipping freight cheaper.3) The inevitable conclusion from all these phenomena and needs leads to the view that in the latest economic epoch (as has been the case for more than two decades) our industry is leading the way; as certain as it is that it owes its size and efficiency to the powerful support of domestic capital, it is inconceivable that our mobile capitals should not follow our industry into foreign countries in a supporting and promoting capacity as soon as they are able to make a powerful appearance there as well. The necessity that this must be done more comprehensively than hitherto has been emphasized by no one so seriously and tirelessly in writing and speech as the meritorious President of the German Colonial Society. Prince Hohenlohe=Langenburg has never missed an opportunity to remind German capital that it should finally gain the influence it deserves in overseas countries. It is difficult, even more so for the capitalist than the industrialist, to do business in foreign countries, which to a large extent require trust and guarantees. It was therefore understandably prudent for our capitalists to prefer to participate in the ventures of informed foreigners abroad*) Dr. J. E. Wappäus. German Emigration and Colonization Leixzig 1846. R. Jannasch l. c.
country to form independent German societies for the same purpose. However, our capital will certainly not stop there, but will very soon be able to leave the leading hand of foreign entrepreneurs to initiate and carry out independent business. Capital and industry are loyal siblings in our country; domestic industry will benefit from the ventures of our capital in foreign countries. Many surplus workers will then be able to find employment in the home country. And if the fearfulness with which we have hitherto avoided giving states that have been given German money for railroad construction and loans their lands for German settlements will cease, if German capital will acquire the right concessions for this purpose, such as the Americans and English know how to obtain, then there will be no lack of protection for the German Reich for such ventures, which guarantee the success of German colonization through the right combination of capital and labour. We conclude by summarizing the conditions of organized emigration in the following sentences: Organized German emigration requires increased state care for the emigrant and leads to colonizing ventures in which capital and labour combine freely. (2) On the one hand, state welfare must find its expression in a regulation of the emigration business under Reich law, in the improvement of emigration statistics, in the establishment of a state information office for emigrants and in the obligation of our consuls in foreign countries to offer advice and assistance to the German emigrant; on the other hand, in the improvement of German transportation opportunities and in the facilitation of payment terms in foreign countries, provided that the expansion of our economic area is made possible as a result. (3) Every colonizing enterprise is based on the right combination of capital and labour. German colonization is possible if the capital is assured of the protection of the domestic government and the support of the government of the foreign country. (4) German colonization is mainly a matter of interest; capital, without which such an enterprise is not at all feasible, wants and must win. Business without profit is an absurdity, colonization without capital a crime. (5) The colonization enterprise is in any case a good one, if the trade and industry of the native country derive advantage from it, and the existence of the German emigrant in his new home is morally and physically secured. 6 The more the German is able to preserve his language and his old habits in his new homeland and maintain spiritual and material relations with his country of origin, the more national it becomes. Dutch East Indies 1890. by Emil Metzger. Overview. For some time now, the Dutch East Indies have been in a state of crisis brought about by a series of very different circumstances; the situation is made even more complicated by the peculiarly entangled circumstances in Holland, which are currently making it more difficult than ever to find a way out. Let us take a closer look at the last point. After the revision of the Dutch constitution (1887), the elections for the second chamber resulted in an anti-liberal majority, which, however, is made up of various elements (conservatives, Catholics, orthodox Protestants and anti-revolutionaries; the first chamber, on the other hand, is liberal. The latter has now, by a majority of only one vote, rejected the budget of the Colonial Minister Keuchenius, who was the soul of the Cabinet, not so much with the intention of persuading him to resign as to remove the Colonial Minister from his position, where he was beginning to become very uncomfortable, some believe even dangerous, in many respects, especially through the rash way in which he repeatedly expressed his very orthodox religious convictions. Under these circumstances, it will be very difficult for any Minister, whatever party he may belong to, to obtain a majority in either House sufficiently confident to follow him willingly, but also with great perseverance, in the course which he must resolutely pursue, if he would direct Indian affairs on lines which might, in the course of time, lead to better conditions. That it would be possible to bring about the latter by some partial improvements in

Page 107

To bring about brevity is an illusion to which no one who seriously considers the circumstances will surrender. Too much has been sinned against for too long, and in too many different ways, for it to be possible to fend for itself in detail; a radical cure is necessary. But apart from the fact that it is not at all easy to find the necessary remedies for such a cure, it would be very difficult to apply them in such a way that the transition would perhaps not cause even worse conditions than those which now prevail. It is comparatively easy to propose a series of isolated good and expedient measures, and even to bring them into being; it is much more difficult to apply them in such a way that they fit into given conditions and bring about the transition to a new order of things in a natural way and without upheaval; In addition, their total effect is influenced by too many different factors to ever be certain of them in advance. The main moments of the crisis in which India finds itself are, in so far as human actions have had an influence on them, a consequence of half-measures which have been the cause of vacillation with regard to the very first economic principles. One wanted to break with one system because of the disadvantages associated with it, but did not do so entirely because of the advantages associated with it. As a result, the good that was achieved in individual cases was never able to take full effect. Let us explain what has been said in more detail. In theory, the idea that the state could not only run the government, but could also establish plantations and sell the products, has been abandoned, and yet in practice it has not yet been possible to find a way to abolish the cash crops, the remainder of the forced cultivation introduced by van den Bosch. The yield of the harvest and the random market price still play a major role in the procurement of the state budget, whose demands are constantly increasing. The increase in expenditure is the natural consequence of a whole series of useful measures taken to expand the state machine; it is the consequence of other measures taken to increase the productive power of the country; it is finally the consequence of the war in Atjeh, which has now been going on for 18 years. A peculiar feature of Indian economic policy must be mentioned here. In the past, India had been extremely thrifty in order to provide the mother country with the largest possible surpluses (which, however, have been a thing of the past for years), but later the highly praiseworthy principle that current income and expenditure, including the costs of the war in Atjeh and the money needed for railroads and port construction, must be in balance was applied. Despite the hundreds of millions spent for such purposes, this has been fairly successful; the debts incurred for the Indian national budget are relatively insignificant, amounting to only a fraction of a single year's revenue. Such an apparently extraordinarily favorable result has only been obtained by drawing upon the taxing power of India in a manner which was bound to have the worst consequences, and has continued to do so even when the amount of money brought into the country by the plantations owned by private individuals began to flow more sparingly in consequence of the bad harvests and the diseases prevailing in the plantations, as well as the low prices. Among the means used to fill the treasury, however, there is one above all others, which until recently has yielded increasing sums every year, but against which the cry of indignation is rising ever louder, especially because of the way in which the yield has been increased, namely the opium rent. Even if there are various other revenues where the tax screw has been tightened a little too tightly, none of them arouses the dissatisfaction of public opinion to the same extent, even though another tax, the land tax, in and of itself weighs even more heavily on the natives. As you can see, the task of those who are to bring about a thorough improvement here is not an easy one. He should, if we only consider the most immediate tasks, make the state treasury independent of the fluctuations of the market by dropping the role of the planter and merchant, or at least, if this is not immediately possible, ensure that the coffee culture becomes less oppressive for the native. He should also devise a means of putting an end to the Atjeh War and, finally, he should also renounce, in whole or in part, the proceeds of the opium lease, so that in 1891 the deficit, if opium and coffee were sacrificed, would reach about 48 million fl., although about 9 million fl. of the expenditure is earmarked for railroad construction. In many people's opinion, the means to replace all these sums are to be sought and found in greater development of the country. However, even the boldest imagination would find it difficult to identify the way in which this could be achieved in the short term. Let us now take a closer look at the points touched on above. II. The government's coffee plantations. In October 1888, a commission was appointed to advise on the means of preventing the decline of government plantations and ensuring that the population received adequate compensation for their work (which was already prescribed in Art. 56 para. 4 of the Government General Regulations, which states: "The Governor shall ensure that the payment of the natives involved in the plantations is such that they earn at least as much in the government plantations as they would receive through voluntary plantations, while avoiding a harmful price increase"). Apart from the fact that Art. 56 para. 4 has already been interpreted in very different ways, a superficial examination shows that the content cannot be satisfied as long as the principles followed so far are maintained. The government appoints the families who are to work on the coffee plantations, assigns them the land they are to plant and the gardens they are to cultivate, directs the work through its own officials (sometimes badly enough), but does not pay for the work but for the product delivered, so that the entire risk rests on the planter and the wages for the work are paid very late. Only a part of the population bears this heavy burden; for it is heavy for most of those involved, because for the majority of the workers the wages received for their work bear no relation to their performance. The yield of the plantations is very unequal in the various provinces, partly as a result of the greater or lesser tact shown by the officials at the time of the introduction of forced cultivation. Some average figures may serve to confirm what has been said; however, such average calculations are generally difficult and only have a very relative value, even if they agree with each other, as is the case with regard to the working time required to cultivate the coffee gardens, which serves as the basis for the following. Earlier (Scottih Geogr. Mag. 1888 VIII, IX and XI), the writer of these lines estimated the required output at 100 working days per year; the above-mentioned commission came to the same conclusion. If we start from this premise, the yield of the working day of a family (because women and children also work in the Gärien) in 1886 varied between 1 Pf. and 205 Pf. per day. In 1888 (J. Hudig, N. Rotterd. Ct. 31. XII. 1889), after the remuneration to be paid to the population had been raised from 14 fl. to 15 fl. per picul, it was calculated from 1.7 to 200 Pf. If one divides the result according to provinces, one finds the remuneration in 7 cases lower than 10 cents (17 Pf.), 5 times 10-20 cents (17-34 Pf.), 1 time 20-30 cents (34-51 Pf.), 1 time 30-40 Pf. (51-68 Pf.), 1 time 40-50 cents (68-85 Pf. to then immediately reach the maximum (200 Pf.). Production fluctuated between 0 and 7.2 picul per family. These few figures alone will make it clear that the way things have started (by increasing the payment from 14 fl. to 15 fl. per picul; the majority of the coffee commission has also envisaged an increase to 20 fl. for Java), no real remedy for the ills can be achieved. An increase of 7 percent, or even a further 33½ percent, is not enough for some areas, while for others it is superfluous and places an unnecessary burden on the already strained state treasury. It is therefore to be hoped that the States General will not be inclined to approve proposals aimed at a general and uniform increase in payment per pickul. As the opinion just expressed is widely shared, other proposals have been made in order to avoid the aforementioned evil. Some want culture to be abandoned altogether where it pays too poorly, others want the situation of the natives to be improved by higher pay only in the latter case. Both have their dubious side. If one resorts to the first means mentioned, not only does the state treasury suffer a heavy loss, but the amount of money coming into the hands of the native also decreases. However small the income may be,

Page 108

which the cash culture yields to the native, however great the service by which he acquires it, it must be borne in mind that he does not immediately find another way of acquiring even this small amount, while as a result of the altered principles of government, instead of some service in labor, one is imposed upon him in money. This is a very serious side of the question, which, in our opinion, is often not sufficiently considered. - To introduce an unequal payment would have still more serious drawbacks; perhaps such a measure itself would not be without danger. The native has a well-developed sense of justice, and tolerates even strong pressure, as long as it acts evenly, but resists it as soon as he believes that another enjoys an advantage in this respect. Moreover, the state would not only have to sacrifice all its advantage, but also add considerable sums in order to bring the result in the provinces unfavorable to coffee culture more or less in line with the provisions of Article 56, which would not be right for the very reason that the indigenous population is not entirely without blame for the poor success, even though it is largely attributable to other circumstances (poor quality of the soil, unfavorable location of the gardens with regard to the distances to the places of residence). If one compares the results from 1848 to 1852 with those of the years 1883 to 1887, there has been a 17 percent decrease in coffee production throughout Java. However, this reduction is not evenly distributed, but amounts to 57 percent in 13 provinces, while the yield in the others has remained unchanged and even increased (by up to 83 percent). We can pass over various other proposals, as well as the Commission's plans, since in our opinion it is less a question of individual measures than of the basic principle. As soon as the government abandons forced labor, we believe that it will no longer be able to continue the operation of the coffee gardens with any prospect of success, if only because its officials lack the necessary experience and time. If it therefore intends to go further in this respect than it has done so far, this will be a new step on the path on which alone a sensible financial policy can be implemented, i.e. independence from the fluctuations of the market can be achieved. In order to achieve this goal, the operation of the coffee gardens must gradually be transferred into the hands of private individuals (Europeans or natives), who would of course also have to retain free disposal of their product (i.e. no delivery to the government!). From a legal point of view, the matter would probably cause some difficulties because of the rights that the natives have to the plantations; but if the matter is taken seriously, it should be possible to find a solution. Of course, if the Government did not wish to cause itself the greatest disadvantage, a beginning would have to be made with those provinces in which the result of cultivation is unfavorable; but in general, and in the interest of the natives, cultivation should be continued on the present footing, without increasing the payment in those provinces where the return on labor, according to the average calculation, is 20 cents or more; in the other provinces, the population should be supported by giving them the opportunity to carry out paid work to improve the coffee plantations, the value of which would thereby be increased. This idea is by no means new; proposals along these lines had already been made to the government in the past; the plan failed because of the government's principles at the time, which excluded Europeans from the interior of the island as far as possible in order to avoid their competition and influence on the natives. Now the reasons which were decisive at that time should no longer be decisive, and that the raising of the necessary capital, if the transition takes place over a long series of years, will not encounter any serious difficulties, needs no proof. Still another circumstance almost imperatively compels us to consider seriously the procedure indicated; for a number of years the soil has been exhausted by a kind of overexploitation; various circumstances, including the ever-increasing competition, point to a more intensive cultivation than is now possible for the government, if it does not wish to completely reorganize its business on a different basis at great sacrifice and without being certain of success; But that would be a measure to which it could hardly feel encouraged, as things stand at present, while such a step backwards in economic terms (because the dependence of income on the fluctuations of the market would be permanent) would hardly find the necessary support.

Accounts from Cameroon.") By Georg Valdan. he Hondel of the Colobor men and the through the fields The Nio del Neo and its cub territory. -2 Discovery of the mouth of the meme. - The Derobeuengeraen Bernaal tations of the Balundo=villages. - Journey to Balundu and Neme. The river, which has its outlet in the innermost corner of the Bay of Biafra, has been called Rio del Rey from time immemorial, but its course was completely unknown until recently. When the border between the German colony of Cameroon and the English protectorate of Old Calabar was regulated, it was decided that the border should follow the Rio del Rey. This aroused interest in getting to know this river better, and so the Governor of Cameroon went there in 1885. Baron von Soden, went up there to explore the supposed river. It was discovered that the Rio del Rey is not a river, but only a large lagoon or a common outlet basin for a number of small streams and creeks. When investigating the deep and extremely numerous creeks that cross the swampy Delta country in all directions, a large river, Massake, was discovered to the east of the Rio del Rey, which was followed far to the north and then to the east and south-east, where waterfalls and rapids were encountered. These were later visited by Dr. Zintgraf, who traveled overland from Love. A little to the east of the Massake lies another wide river mouth, or more correctly lagoon, called Ndame - our Rumbi - by the natives, which was also investigated. This also leads to the north, but narrows down to a small stream, Mondimba, which also bends towards Often. Here lies Love,*) formerly the seat of one of the richest and most influential Calabar merchants, called Hellow Duke. A few months before these investigations, Knutson and I had discovered a large river, the Meme, on a trip to the country north of Mount Cameroon, which we mistakenly thought was the Rio del Rey. When we later learned of the existence of the Massake and Rumbi rivers, we believed that the Meme was the ore part of the latter river. This seemed to be confirmed later. Dr. Zintgraff travelled to Love via Bakundu-ba=Mussaka in February 1887 and passed the Meme at Ngongo, where the river disappears into a swamp, which is why it was impossible to get a proper idea of its size. When he came across the Mondimba at Love, he assumed that this river was the same one that he had come to know in the interior of the country under the name Meme. At the beginning of March 1887, however, I was on board the small Aviso steamer "Nachtigal", which was in the governor's charge, and then read the nautical chart of the Massake and Rumbi for the first time. I was surprised to find that the Mondimba at Love was only 35 meters wide and 1 meter deep at the end of the rainy season, i.e. at about the lowest water level. In contrast, the Meme, which we passed deep in the land of Bavovanjanga, had at least twice as much water at the beginning of the rainy season. It therefore became clear to me that the Meme was a large river, known only to us and as yet unexplored. As I was busy building a factorel in Mokundange near Victoria at this time, I had no time to undertake a research trip, but I sent Knutson in Bibundi news of my discovery with the request to try to find the mouth of the river when the opportunity arose. At the same time, Knutson, in the hope of finding a new trading place, had made a voyage to southern Balundalande and had reached a village, Balundu=ba=Boa, which had a fairly significant trade, but was not suitable for our purposes due to its great distance from the coast. The same relationship was said to apply to all the Balunda villages with the exception of Lore. One can see from this what great importance the Meme must have for trade, if, as could be assumed, it is navigable for a greater distance into the country. The fact that this river had completely escaped the attention of the Germans when they were exploring Deltaland could be explained partly by the fact that near its mouth it undoubtedly disappears into the numerous small rivers that flow into the Ndame, and partly by the jealousy of the natives for their trade and their unwillingness to betray their trade routes. The trade of the whole country was always in the hands of the black merchants of Calabar, who exercised a great deal of arbitrary power over the population. They gave the villages "trust", i.e. goods on credit, and if these were not properly paid for, the people were forced to pay for them. We would like to draw our readers' attention to this very interesting article translated from the Swedish magazine "Ymer", as the northern Cameroon region was previously little known. We would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Erik Dahlgreen, the secretary of the Swedish Geographical Society in Steckholm, for his kind mediation. Dr. Zintgraff, who is in the service of the German government, has been exploring the Cameroon colony since January 1887 and, as is well known, recently completed the important journey from Cameroon to Adamana and back. With regard to the subject dealt with in this work, we refer to the series of articles "Reconnaissance journeys in the Cameroon Colony", which appeared in the German Col. Zig. in 1886 and 1887, especially to the article in issues 7 and 10 of the 1857 volume, as this area was also dealt with there. D. R. Ndode of the German maps. A map completed according to the latest surveys will be published in the next issue of the newspaper. D. R.

When they were captured, they took their debtors and their families as prisoners to Calabar, where they had to remain as slaves forever. In this way, several hundred men, women and children have been taken away to slavery in recent years. The people could not protect themselves against these robberies, as the Calabar men wisely never sold them guns or powder. On the other hand, the merchants and their companions were always well armed, some of them even with breech-loading rifles. The natives had gradually become accustomed to regarding the merchants as their lords and masters, to whom they had to bow, albeit reluctantly. This authority of the Calabar men was somewhat weakened when the governor, on his first visit to Love, had the Hellow Duke sign a treaty recognizing the supremacy of the German Empire and forbidding him to import rum unless he wanted to pay the rum tax of 2000 marks that had been set for the German colony. As Pellow Duke was by no means an admirer of the Germans, this annoyed him so much that he went to Calabar some time later and did not return. This gave the people courage to complain of their plight to the governor on a later visit, declaring at the same time that Hellow Duke was not their king, but only a merchant who, with the help of a numerous retinue of armed protégés and slaves, had arrogated to himself a despotic power from which they wished to be free. The governor now concluded a treaty with their rightful king and their chiefs, similar to the treaty previously concluded with Hellow Duke, and at the same time informed them that neither he nor any other Caladar man had the slightest right to command them, but that, on the contrary, those who were guilty of any acts of violence would be severely punished. To set an example more eloquent than all the assurances in the world, one such Freyler was taken to Cameroon as a prisoner for some time, which gave all the Calabar men a great fright and strengthened the courage and confidence of the oppressed. The latter now knew that they had a protector who was much more powerful than any of their oppressors. The white men, of whom they had heard so much, but with whom they had hitherto had no contact, had suddenly appeared in their midst and taken up their cause and punished their enemies. Encouraged by this, first Love and then the other Balundudors began to defy the merchants and oppose them, which in turn had the consequence that the latter, who felt secure in the knowledge that the whites lived far away, began to collect their claims with great vigor, because they realized that their trade would soon come to an end, since the whites had found their trade routes. This opposition movement against the Calabar men had also spread to the above-mentioned village of Balunda=ba=Boa, although they had not yet dared to speak openly with them. The village was a long way from Love and had never seen white men, so it was a very risky game to make enemies of the merchants. But then came Knutson's visit, which, brief as it was, exerted a decisive influence on the senses. The people now knew that the whites knew how to find the way to them, and besides, these whites lived only a day's journey away from them and might be willing to help them if necessary. This visit had given them moral support, which they knew how to use by refusing to sell oil to the Calabar men on the pretext that they had to save it for the white men. Meanwhile, Knutson had been prevented from undertaking the intended expedition by a number of other occupations when, at the beginning of May, several people from Balundu=ba=Bosa arrived in Bibundi and complained that Hellow Duke's men had forcibly taken several barrels of oil from them and threatened to return with a larger force and burn the village to the ground. They had therefore broken off all contact with the merchants, hid the oil in the forest and sent these people to ask for our protection and for us to come and trade with them. On May 9, Knutson set out by boat to visit the mouth of the Meme. He was accompanied by Mr. E. Bovallius and had as oarsmen five Krumänner and two men from Sanji, as well as a lad from Victoria, Rgalle, and a Bibundi man, Malombi, who knew the Balundu and Calabar languages as well as a little English. Favored by a good wind, he arrived that same day in the northernmost of the Betikka villages, Enda, which is situated on the northern bank of the mouth of the Malande River, which leads to Balundu=ba=Boa. Just as in the other Betikkad villages, there were millions of mosquitoes here too, so that none of our travelers, neither white nor black, could close an eye The following day, after a long negotiation, Knutson succeeded in persuading the local chief to accompany him, and with him as a guide we now headed up the Ndame, which is 1-2 km wide at the mouth. To the right and left, larger and smaller rivers opened up, the ones on the right leading to the Balundu villages of Bonjari, Bungo and Illoani. Several of these rivers were very large, and the one leading to Jlloani was even supposed to be one of the estuaries of the Meme; but as the guide did not know the way there, the journey was continued on the Ndame until a considerably smaller river proved to be the correct mouth of the Meme. The fact that this had escaped the attention of the Germans was not surprising, as it had the appearance of an ordinary smaller river with salt water and a current that follows the ebb and flow of the tide. The fact that the river water cannot make itself felt there is due to the fact that not much more than a third of the river's water mass pours out this way.
Knutson now steered up the river, which during a rowing trip of a few hours kept its bay-like appearance with channels on both sides, but then the banks began to become higher and drier, the mangrove trees and raffia palms ceased and gave way to the usual tree species of the African forests. After another four hours' journey, we reached a landing site on the northern bank belonging to the village of Kumbe. The river there was 2 meters deep and 40 meters wide. Half an hour from the shore was the village, which, like the other Balunda villages, had whitewashed houses. The inhabitants were delighted with the visit, and when they heard that the white men were inclined to buy their land and possibly intended to enter into trade with them, their joy reached its peak. The king immediately had a young cow slaughtered for his guests, and hastened to complete the purchase of the land, as if he feared that the white men might later dereue it. For they believed that once they had sold their land and received their "Kalati" papers, Calabar would not dare to touch them again, and they also hoped that this would bring them into direct trade relations with the whites, a thing that all blacks aspired to. At the moment only a few Caladar men in the village were busy buying up ol. On the same day as Knutson, some men from nearby Love also arrived here with a payier, which they presented with the question of whether this was a "good palaver" (agreement). It turned out to be a two-week-old purchase contract, according to which the C. Woermann company in Cameroon had bought Love and acquired the exclusive right to build there. As the Germans were not familiar with the Meme, Love was considered to be the only port in the country, and as the major trade routes from Bakundu and other landlocked countries converged there, it was thought that the possession of Love had given them a monopoly on trade in these areas, so to speak. This would indeed have been the case (to be continued.) if the meme had not existed. Correspondence. From Kaiser Wilhelmsland. Since the beginning of August 1889, Mr. Arnold), who was appointed general manager by the board of the New Guinea Company, has taken up his activities here and it seems that the company - according to all indications - now wants to pursue the goals of a plantation company. Its existing stations, until now almost exclusively very expensive experimental stations, are to continue to deal with the planting of certain products. The Stephausort station is very promising, where the station manager, Mr. Hermes, has brought 9-12 hectares of land under tobacco cultivation since last year. The first harvest, which took place a few months ago, leaves nothing to be desired in terms of quantity; in terms of quality, at least as far as individual lots are concerned, it falls somewhat short of expectations. The sizeable fermentation barn, 150 feet long and 70 feet wide, proved to be far too small for this harvest. The larger drying barn, in which the tadak takes up more space, was even less adequate. - The station employs Miokesen (people from the Bismarck Archipelago; serner Bukadoys, natives from the Solomon Islands, as well as natives from the area around Finschhafen, Papuas) in the fields and in the barns. Unfortunately, the company is unable to obtain sufficient numbers of these people, so that the work soon overflows here and there. On Stephansort the number of fardy Ardites fluctuated between 50 and 80, depending on whether people were leaving or arriving. Although there was generally nothing to complain about them as workers, they proved not to be very suitable for sorting the tobacco. Their not very delicate hands cause a lot of breakage; the company should therefore consider bringing in Malay tobacco workers from the Netherlands. According to the results obtained at Stephansort, the broad coastal fringe along the Astrolabebal is considered particularly suitable for tobacco cultivation. It is therefore very likely that more tobacco plantations will soon be established here. Recently there have been rumors that a plantation company is already in negotiations with the New Guinea Company. In addition to tadak, Stephankort also grows maize, hams and sweet potatoes to feed the workers. The result of this year's first maize harvest is 120 to 150 quintals. If the maize crops cover the company's needs in time, it may well consider exporting them to Australia. Next, the station will start planting cotton on the existing tobacco fields. A freshly cleared area of around 20 to 25 hectares will be allocated to tobacco. Apart from Stephandort, Hatzfeldthafen also has tobacco. A small consignment was already shipped to Germany from there at the beginning of this year and, depending on the quality, is said to have fetched a price of 60, 80, but also 250 to 300 pfennigs per pound. Prices as low as the first two will certainly become increasingly rare for Neu=Gulnea tobacco, the more tobacco cultivation is naturalized and improved here under the guidance of experts. The first large consignment of New Guinea cotton will arrive at Constantine Harbour for shipment to Germany. This is the result of this year's harvest, representing about 45 tons of cleaned goods. In the future, Konstantinhafen, as well as other stations, are likely to start more extensively with the coffee harvest.

 port, the main station, a small start was made about 3 years ago. In addition to the 4 stations on New Guinea, the company also maintains a station in the Bismarck Archipelago, on the island of Kerawara. This station has so far mainly been an administrative station, but in the not too distant future it is to be converted into a plantation station and, if this intention is realized, will be moved to Blanchedal. It is reported that the company will establish a labor station in the local archipelago or on the Solomon Islands at the beginning of the new year for the purpose of recruiting skilled workers. It has already acquired a schooner for this purpose. The two steamers of the New Guinea Company alternate between voyages to Soerabaya and regular visits to the Bismarck Archipelago. A larger sailing ship is waiting in Finschhafen to bring in coal and for voyages to Europe. At the end of last month, Privy Councillor Dr. Rose arrived here to take up his post as German Imperial Commissioner for Kaiser Wilhelmland and the Bismarck Archipelago. On the railroad question in German East Africa. No. 7 of the Deutsche Kolonialzeitung contains a few lines commemorating a lecture I gave in the Berlin section on the railroad question in East Africa on the 21st of March. In view of the importance of this question, it would perhaps seem appropriate to add a few more details to the latter, all the more so as an article in the same issue of the newspaper also contains an article entitled: "The Great South", "The Rusiji=Ulanga Line" is discussed as a connecting line to the interior of the country, for which the priority of the Jdee is due to Count Joachim von Pfeil, on the other hand it is said to the Dedatte following my lecture that a conclusion had not been reached, the railroad question for Usambara would be examined again later in a special lecture by Mr. Premierleutnant Weiß. However, my plan for East Africa as a whole needs to be supplemented. I do not want to leave it unmentioned that the priority of the idea for this railroad connection in the Pangani Valley up to Kilimanjaro is probably due to Prime Lieutenant Weiß, who was present on the spot, which he indicated in a travel report s. Z. has indicated. The lecture I gave would therefore not really have brought anything new to the table - and the matter seemed to be closed, unless the "railroad question" was illuminated from another side in a more complete and better way than I was able to do. On the other hand, I would like to emphasize that my "Plan for the Construction of Railways" has several features that distinguish it from the special plans and that the main idea is logically implemented in it, "to project the railroad and river navigation facilities in general in a radial, decentralized direction from a main port on the coast through the territory under German sovereignty to the large inland lakes, in three main directions, of which the Rusiji River in the southwest and the Pangani in the northwest, as well as the main caravan route in the middle to Mpuapua=Tabora in an almost westerly direction, are the main directions. The idea was to utilize the natural water power available in the streams and tributaries of this continent, as it is found in the same in a peculiar way in hundreds of points, in thousands of horsepower - by transferring it into electrical energy as operating power for the railroad carriages and ships' hulls, etc., as a preference. An essay I wrote and submitted to the German Colonial Society for their information: "Natural labor for the development of colonial culture in Africa" gave me particular cause, on the advice of this society, to get in touch with the chief engineer of Siemens and Halske. Since I myself have been studying the practical application of electrical energy since 1876 as the entrepreneur of the Magdeburg electricity company, I believe I can form a real idea of how this motor power can also be used in the operation of the East African communication routes, in addition to the reserved reserve use of animal traction power, steam, etc., in the projection of the systems themselves. If the water forces of the Rusiji and the two falls of the Pangani are easy to grasp, then, apart from the utilization of the current water forces to be cut through from the Mpuanua Tabora railroad to Tanganvika for the projected main railroads, the utilization of the manpower donated to us for free by nature is absolutely essential. Taking into account all the relevant natural, geographical, political, military and trade conditions, my general plan for the construction of railroad, river, coastal and seaborne facilities for Africa and especially for German East Africa was drawn up. I am busy drawing up the more specific preliminary plans and have applied to a competent authority for a license for the company's facilities and operations, and have already received a corresponding decision. F. Immeckenberg, engineer. News from the company. - The Committee of the German Colonial Society held a meeting on April 15 at the Society's offices under the chairmanship of Dr. Hammacher. It was announced that the resolution passed at the board meeting concerning the petition to the Reich Chancellor on the safeguarding of German spheres of interest had been carried out. The reports of the united commissions for rules of procedure and for practical colonization were then received and the motions Darmstadt. Hanover and Eberswalde were dealt with. A motion from the Stettin department concerning the Society's information offices was referred to the Emigration Commission for preliminary examination. After other business matters had been dealt with, the formation of departments in Altenburg, Iserlohn and Gütersloh was announced. The Committee expressed its thanks to the gentlemen who had rendered outstanding services to the establishment of these departments. In the Berlin section on April 18, Mr. F. Bley spoke about the Masiti, the warlike tribes of the Mahengeland, whose customs and habits are often reminiscent of the Zulu, with whom they are closely related. Redner, who had come into contact with the Masiti several times at his station in Usungula, described in detail their military organization, the system of their raids against the weaker tribes living nearby, their fighting style and cruelty. A serious relationship of friendship with them was impossible. They must be subjugated, must thoroughly feel the German power. If a fortified station is established in their country and the first chief himself or some of his favorite sons are taken hostage to Bagamoyo to secure the Eurovaeans living there, if an annual tribute of ivory is imposed on them, which can gradually be converted into a tribute of sesame seed and possibly, in later times, of cash, then they may be called friends and their assurances of subservience may be believed. Not before! But then this warlike tribe will also provide us with good soldiers, especially among Zulu=Unterofsians. And so its wild strength may gradually be put to the service of civilization. - Cologne Division. The Cologne Branch held its annual general meeting on April 11. In the annual report, the secretary, Mr. Referendar Clemens, gave a pleasing picture of the varied and successful activities of the department in the past year, which have been reported on continuously in the Kolonialzeitung. We emphasize the agitation against the slave trade, in favour of a German colonial office, the mail steamer line to East Africa, the increase in the protection force for South West Africa, against the sale of part of South West Africa and for securing the borders in German East Africa. During this time, the department organized three large public meetings, three men's evenings and three large lectures with ladies. We would like to emphasize that it is not yet generally known that the extraordinarily high attendance at the public meetings and the lecture evenings demonstrated the keen interest of the people of Cologne in the national colonial endeavours, and that their willingness to make sacrifices for these purposes was also reflected in the significant success of the fundraisers which the Society organized in the city. Around 4,500 marks were raised for the German warriors in Samoa and East Africa, around 2,500 marks for the German hospice in Zanzibar and 900 marks for other purposes of the society; a number of gentlemen from Düren donated 700 marks to the Cologne department to support its political activities. The treasurer, Mr. v. Recklinghausen, gave a detailed report on the use of the collected funds and the regular membership fees, which presented a pleasing picture of the financial situation of the department. The chairman, Mr. Hamm, the senior public prosecutor, then spoke enthusiastically about the warm interest that the Emperor showed in the national colonial cause and the enthusiastic freshness with which he grasped this and all major issues in Germany, true to his saying: "The course remains the same, and now full steam ahead! Magdeburg Division. The department held its monthly meeting on April 10, at which Professor Maenß presented the annual report and Mr. Albert Giesan spoke about the East African railroad project. Gdansk Section. On March 17, 18 and 19, Mr. Wessel, a painter from Düsseldorf, presented living pictures from Africa in the large hall of the Friedrich=Wilhelm=Schützenhaus for the benefit of German nursing care in East Africa. The arrangements were made by the department and a ladies' committee, headed by Mrs. Oberrräsident von Leinziger. The performers were ladies and gentlemen of the first society. The presentation of the pictures was artistic; they were universally applauded. Despite the high expenses, the net profit was considerable. - Department Annaberg. On March 13, Mr. v. Hake gave a lecture on German East Africa in Annaberg, which aroused lively interest and led to the formation of a section. The same speaker spoke on the 16th in Hamm on the Kulif question in connection with his experiences on the railroad expedition in East Africa. London Division. The annual report of the department, presented by Dr. Friedrich Fick, begins with a description of the colonial political events of the past year and points out "that the events of the past year have demonstrated in the most obvious way that an association such as the German Colonial Society is still necessary and that the raison d'étro of the same has not now ceased to exist, as has often been claimed by friends. In view of the events of the past year, it seems more necessary than ever before that the friends of German colonial politics stick together and try to assert their opinion in a well-organized association. It is necessary for all those who are convinced of the necessity of German colonial development to present their reasons to the German people again and again and to counteract the discouragement which is a consequence of the losses suffered by lukewarm friends, in word and writing, and through planned associational activity, and the necessity of the existence of a community led by independent men, which in the given case is able to give our government the desired support and, in the case of the colonization of the German colonies, is able to support them, continues to exist.

of the same can represent the public opinion of a significant fraction of the educated elements of our people. The past year in particular should be a reminder for us to continue to work for the growth of our association; for our opponents in the matter are also constantly at work and seek first to lure away the lukewarm elements, and unfortunately the opponents have an easier game, because they do not need to demand any postive achievements. Nevertheless, as far as our department is concerned, we can state that it is growing steadily. We now have 83 members and what is particularly pleasing is the lively interest that the members show in our cause. The Darmstadt branch held its annual general meeting on the evening of Monday, April 14. From the annual report first presented by the chairman, it should be mentioned that the number of members, which had already increased considerably in the previous year, continued to rise in the past year - now to 130 - including gentlemen who have come to know our colonies personally. Six board meetings were held, which were also associated with gentlemen's evenings for the club members in general. The department had two lectures held last winter: by the explorer Mr. H. Zöller on East Africa and Kaiser Wilhelmsland, and by Count E. zu Erbach on the history of the South American republics. Mr. Wangemann's lecture on East Africa also contributed to the growing interest in colonial matters. After the treasurer had presented a relatively satisfactory financial report, the statutory election of the new board was essentially carried out by re-election of the existing board. Then business wishes were discussed and finally the member Captain von M., who recently returned from a trip around the world, reported on the most interesting experiences and impressions of the same in an informal and informal manner - Department Forst i. L. On March 28, the General Assembly was held; in which first Dr. mod. Pilgrim reported on the proceedings of the board meeting held in Verlin on March 22, to which he had been sent by the department. The chairman then made the pleasing announcement that the number of members had risen from 46 to 55 since the previous year. Senior teacher Dr. Netzker was re-elected as chairman, Georg Rüdiger as treasurer, and Dr. Pilgrim was elected secretary. Department Mülheim a. Rb." On March 29 and 31, Mr. V. Reichard gave lectures on his travels in East Africa and Stanley's expedition, which were well attended. The second lecture was followed by the first chairman of the department. Mr. G. Küchen, preceded the second lecture with a gripping speech in which he emphasized the necessity of an energetic colonial policy, especially with regard to English claims, and stressed the aim of the German Colonial Society to spread information and inspiration to ever wider circles. The division, several members of which have declared their willingness to give lectures, intends to continue vigorously along this path. - Department Frankfurt a. O. The department held its general meeting on February 15 under the chairmanship of Mr. Oberpostdirektor Heindorf, who presented the annual report on the activities of the 122-member department in the past year, which focused primarily on spreading understanding for the colonial political tasks. The new election was completed shortly by unanimous re-election of the previous board (Oberpostdirektor Heindorf, chairman, lawyer Hauptmann, deputy chairman, medical officer Dr. Siegfried, treasurer, city councillor Trowitzsch, deputy treasurer, Regierungsreferendar v. Rosenstiel, secretary, lieutenant Wangemann, deputy secretary). After the discussion of the school issue for East Africa and the agitation against the slave trade, Assesior Michaelis was given the floor for the announced lecture on "Experiences in Japan". The aforementioned gentleman, who had spent four years there on behalf of our government in the service of the Japanese government in order to establish a German-style justice system, presented a highly interesting picture of the conditions there. Short notes. (A letter from Sultan Osman of Halule.) "Praise be to God alone! May he remain protected by the Sultan Osman Mahmud Jussuff, the exalted Sultan of the name Medjertin. To Your Excellency our honored and esteemed acquaintance and dear friend Hörnecke, the German government architect, may God preserve his power. First of all, the question about your honored condition, hopefully you are in perfect health and well-being. Then, O our friend, know that your letter has reached us and that we have taken note of its contents. You said (in it) that you have chosen an intelligent, sincere and reliable man from your countrymen, named Kurt Hoffmann, and that from his side men from his friends are coming to us with honors and gifts, and you also said in your letter that only they should settle down and give them a place to build and land to cultivate. This is what you have told us. So know now, O friend, that there is a connection and agreement between us, Russia, France, England and Italy. Every single one of these powers has demanded residences from us, has demanded harbors and people from us. But we refused and they left us alone. They did us no harm when we met; we honored them and they honored us. You are now in the same position as they were; you will receive full honors when you come to us. But as far as buildings and lands and residences are concerned, we cannot grant them to you or any other people. For our land shall remain free of foreigners; we want neither Jews nor Christians, neither Eucopaeans nor Arabs in it, but only the tribes of Medjertin. Therefore, do not ask us for anything of what exists in our country. This is what we have to tell you, and the greeting is the best conclusion 27 Redcheb 1307 (March 19, 1890).

For the month of January the total value of imports to the Cult even amounted to 127395 dollars as against 30 360 in the previous year. - During the same period, ivory imports rose from 4,200 pieces of teeth to 7,500 pieces. - Bana Herl and Jehast have surrendered to the Reichskommissar with the rest of their troops. - The English Consul Johnston visited the Rikwa or Lake Leopold in the southwest corner of our sphere of interest at the end of last year. - Tippa Tipp has left for Zanzibar. - Dr. Baumann left Tanga on March 6 to pick up the trace for the railroad to Usambara. - Emin Pasha will leave for Jnnern at the end of this month with a strong caravan. - Stanley, who has recently made many unqualified statements, has spoken very disparagingly about the rescue of game on Kilimanjaro by English and Russian sportsmen and expressed the very sensible opinion that it would be better for this idea to come into German hands so that an end could be put to this misfortune. If the Congo State enacts hunting laws to protect elephants, Germany could do something similar for its territories so that we are spared the dismal experiences we have had in South Africa. - With regard to the islands of Manda and Patta, which, as is well known, were ceded to the English Company by the Sultan of Sausibar, but at the same time were claimed by Germany for the Sultan of Witu, it is reported from Sausibar that the Sultan has revoked the cession of the islands to the English Company at the request of the German government. The representatives of the English Company have refused to recognize this for the time being. - Clemens Denhardt has taken up residence in Lamn as plenipotentiary of the Sultan of Witu. - On March 25, Major Wißmann and Major Liebert went to Kilwa for a reconnaissance. - Major Liebert has returned to Germany. - A very important agreement has been reached between the Reichskommissar and the Administrator-General of the British East African Company on the restriction of trade in water and ammunition and on other measures in the administrative areas on both sides, since "after the experience of the past year it is in the interests of public welfare and good government that the German and British administrations should that the German and English administrations, to whom His Highness the Sultan of Zanzibar has entrusted the exercise of governmental authority on the East African coast from Rovuma to Kipint, proceed on a common basis and in complete agreement and mutual support in certain important matters closely connected with public interests." The Convention refers to the extradition of criminals, the publication and execution of all measures against slaves and the slave trade, and concerted action for the uniform prosecution of the common interest. The regulation concerning the import of weapons consists in the fact that weapons must be stamped, muzzle-loaders can only be sold to trading caravans by the Reichskommissariat and the use of breech-loaders by Europeans is only possible under certain guarantees. The agreement is printed in the Colonial Gazette. (East African Protestant Mission.) Negotiations between the Berlin l. Mission, which is active in Southeast Africa, and the board of the Protestant Missionary Society for German East Africa have been in progress for some time with a view to unification, but have not been successful, as the latter society was not willing to give up its sick leave. In the latest issue of Nachrichten aus der ostarrikanischen Mission, the present tasks of the Protestant missionary society are listed as follows: 1. founding new stations, 2. carrying out the

Construction of the new hospital building, 3. recruitment and training of the staff required for the hospital, a) a clergyman, b) a doctor, e) a nurse, d) a deacon, 4. recruitment of candidates and teachers for the missionary work. (Protectorate of the Marshall Islands.) The Imperial Commissioner a. l. for the Marshall Islands, Vice Consul Biermann, made a voyage through the protectorate from September 23 to October 19 of last year on board H. M. Knbt. "Wolf" on a voyage through the protectorate. In Naurn, the reduction of arms at the time of the flag-biting - in the fall of 1888 - had a beneficial effect, as the uninterrupted wars among the natives had ceased. (Col. Bl.) (Protectorate of the New Guinea Company.) The Imperial Commissioner a. i. for the Protectorate of the New Guinea Company, Regierungsrat Rose, undertook a fact-finding trip through the protectorate on board a company steamer from September 28 of last year to January 12 of this year. The trip first went along the southern coast of New Pomerania to the islands of Kerawara and Mioko and from there to Blanche-Bai, where the cotton and coffee plantation of Mrs. Forsavt in Ralum (Farrel company) was inspected. From BlancheGai, the journey continued along the southwest coast of Neu=Mecklenburg to the Rusa harbor at the northern tip. The Bismarck archipelago was then crossed and the stations Haßfeldthafen, Stephansort and Konstantinhafen were visited. (Col. Bl. (Vice-Consul v. Herff has been appointed for the professional consulate in Pretoria after the return of Vice-Consul Ritschl. - (In Makololo Land,) the South African district which gave rise to the well-known differences between England and Portugal, a terrible massacre has taken place. According to a report from the "Reuters" office in Mozambique, the Makalolos massacred the Portuguese naval lieutenant Valadin, the civil servant Almeida and 150 native soldiers of their entourage. (The Soclété Académique Indo-Chineise) in France has made a number of requests known to the public, of which we emphasize the following: "A remission of taxes shall be granted to those products of our colonies which can participate in the development of the exchange (of products) between France and its overseas possessions, without the products of the main country suffering as a result; those natural products of the French possessions of India which have no equal in France (sesame, arachides, etc.) shall be taxed in French territory.) are admitted duty-free into French territory on condition that they are accompanied by a certificate of origin issued by the colonial authorities. - Emigration conditions in Sio Paulo. The "Germania" published in São Paulo contains the following information, which is characteristic of the conditions there: "We have in our hands a card signed by 15 colonists, fathers of families, who are employed by the fazendeiro Joss Jacinthe do Amaral Pinto in S. Jolo de Boa Vista, and who complain bitterly about bad treatment. They say that the fazendeiro promised each family a cow and an advance of food and money, and that so far they have received nothing, causing them to suffer deprivation and hunger. On Sunday, February 23, when they wanted to go to the town to buy some food and medicine, they were prevented from doing so by the fazendeiro, his sons and five other armed men who drove them back with shots and the butts of their rifles, wounding some of them. They conclude with the request that we take an interest in them, that we ask the governor of the state to have the facts reported investigated and to punish the guilty parties, if any are found. Up to now we have made the liveliest propaganda in favor of German immigration to this state, but if such things happen and are not punished quickly, we will be forced to change our attitude. Although we are still convinced that such incidents are isolated exceptions to the rule, we have no way of continuing our propaganda if they are not suppressed. The "Germania" has published the above communication in Portuguese and demands that the Governor initiate an investigation and punish the guilty parties. It makes its further conduct in the immigration matter (which was quite encouraging with regard to immigration in SäPaulo, the R.) dependent on the success of the above complaint. - (Decorations.) The explorer Hugo Zöller has been awarded the Knight's Cross First Class of the Order of the Zähringer Lion by the Grand Duke of Baden "in recognition of his successful expeditions and his services to the expansion of regional and ethnological studies". - His Majesty the Emperor has conferred the Royal Order of the Crown 3rd Class with Swords on the African explorer Dr. Zintgraff with a white ribbon and black edging. (For the benefit of the German Women's Association for Nursing in the Colonies) an exhibition of ethnographic collections is presented, which Dr. Kohlstock, Lieutenant Sulzer, Märker, Blümke and Count Behr have recently brought home from East Africa and to which others have graciously promised to add and increase. It will present the life and character of the population of that part of Africa, which Germany is gaining under the energetic leadership of Wißmann at the time of civilization, by showing the natives' own weapons, their tools, clothing and decorative objects, and will illustrate the landscapes that form the scene of this process, which is currently captivating the imagination of wide circles, by means of photographs and other pictorial representations. The exhibition will then be able to count on friendly participation and a large number of visitors, both because of its instructive and highly stimulating content and because of the good purpose served by the German Women's Association for Nursing. Its organization and management will be carried out with the cooperation of members of the Women's Association; it is to be opened in the hall of the Royal Academy, Dorotheenstraße 58-59, on Saturday, April 26, and will be open daily from 3-7 p.m. Litterature. Six years of German colonial policy. A supplement to Dr. Fabri's book: Five Years of German Colonial Policy. By Dr. W. Weißendorn. Berlin 1890, published by A. Deudner. The brochure is very interesting, as it settles accounts with the mistakes of the past from a thoroughly colonial-friendly point of view and calls for a policy of reconciliation between the parties for the "new era", which will also affect colonial policy, and wants to help initiate it in order to put all our strength at the service of the colonial movement. The chapter headings give an approximate idea of the author's train of thought: Past and future (deals with the individual colonies). The mistakes of the government and the parties and Colonial policy in the new Reichstag. The brochure is written with surprising expertise, and even if some of the points made do not appear to be sufficiently well-founded, the author's train of thought is nevertheless stimulating for further research, for example when he tries to prove that smallholder settlement in a Negro country, such as East Africa, is a cultivation error. The author, who makes a favorable prognosis for the German East African Society, also argues very eagerly for a reconciliation with the Arabs, for a reorganization of the system of the present scientific stations and the transformation of the colonies into imperial colonies.

Insofar as these contributions have not yet been collected, the departments concerned are required to notify the office by July 1 of those department members who have not paid their contributions despite being requested to do so. The Committee is entitled to suspend delivery of the Kolonial Zeitung to these defaulting members until the subscription has been paid. For those members who have only joined a section after April 1, December 31 shall take the place of July 1. Furthermore, in Section III, the following shall be added after the word "un" in the second paragraph: "with the exception of the case of Section 1V paid Zisser 3. b) a proposal by the Committee to amend Section IV, Item 6 of the Articles of Association to read as follows: "The Divisions and Gauverbände are obliged to obtain the Committee's approval for any public announcement or other measure which may affect the general interests of the Society to be safeguarded by the Executive Board and the Committee.

intend to initiate or promote overseas ventures from Association funds or publicly under the name of the Association.

Please send any motions for the board meeting to the office at Linkstr. 25 as soon as possible. Berlin, May 5, 1890 The Executive Committee of the German Colonial Society. Hermann, Prince of Hohenlohe=Langenburg. We would like to draw our readers' attention to a very interesting report by Dr. Peters, which for technical reasons we were only able to print on the last pages of this issue. The separation of German and English territories in East Africa. Whereas in the past English newspapers claimed that the German East African territory in the west extended as far as a line from the Kawirondobai on the Victoria Nyanza to the confluence of the Msindsche with the Novuma, i.e. that it did not extend beyond Ugogo and not even as far as the north-east coast of the Nyassa, and while the opinion in Germany about the concept of the German sphere of interest was also still wavering, it is now certain that Germany has been making claims to the extension up to the Great Lakes (Nyassa, Tanganyika, Victoria) for some time and that these have been admitted as justified on the whole by the English side. The tracts of land in the west of the German East African coast up to Tanganyika can therefore by no means still be regarded as ownerless or "no man's country" and as open to other endeavors of any kind. However, the time had not yet come and there was no urgent reason for the two powers initially involved, the German and British empires, to make firm agreements on a more precise regulation of the borders. In the meantime, however, the course of events has shown the necessity of settling disputed or seemingly disputed points. The main factors in the changed situation are the successful military action of the German Reichskommissar, the conclusion of Stanley's "liberation" expedition and the entry of Emin Pasha into German service. For if we have succeeded more and more in mastering the insurgent movements against the new order, this has only been achieved at great sacrifice of life and money; we have sealed our permanent interest in the East African colony by our energetic action, which has not shrunk from burdens and losses; but we have naturally made these expenditures in expectation of future compensation, to which we have now acquired a right. The narrow coastal region, although valuable in itself, cannot offer us sufficient compensation without an extensive part of the hinterland; this should above all enable and secure us access to the inner highlands with their trade traffic. But now that Stanley has returned from his geographically significant expedition and the results, or rather the failures, of this expedition in political terms (which even the Times acknowledges) can be surveyed, now that the "liberated" Emin, as a result of the loss of his former province, has placed his skill, his experience and his "prestige", which fully equals that of Stanley, at the disposal of his German fatherland, the situation is much clearer: Germany, despite the short duration of its young colonizing endeavours, has already become a not unequal competitor to England in Africa, which the English themselves have now recognized, and which is why, as realpolitikers, they no longer see us as a quantité négligeable. Incidentally, our swift and energetic action against the Arabs has also been of obvious advantage to the European owners of the neighboring territories of German East Africa, as the Zanzibari Arabs were thereby induced to show greater consideration and respect for Europeans in general. However, the extent to which Germany was always inclined to avoid harming England's real or imagined interests as far as possible was particularly evident from the government's conduct in the matter of the German Emin Pasha expedition. If the East African territories were to be demarcated, it would not be just or fair for the English to claim the lion's share for themselves. If England has always been a master at securing positions that could serve as excellent bases for its trade and transportation, other nations have learned to be equally intent on gaining similar positions. Just as Great Britain had created a series of fortified bases and nodes in world trade to protect its sea-dominating fleet (Gibraltar=Malta=Aden etc.), it also focused its attention first and foremost on acquiring well-situated stations and routes. English traders and trading companies have not been without success in their efforts to open up one of the most important entrances to the lake district of East Africa. The water route via the Zambezi and Shire to the Nyassa and its continuation on land, the road to the southern end of the Tanganyika, has such great and peculiar advantages that it has been called "the route to the Central African Lakes", and now that English privateers have succeeded in establishing themselves on this route, England, although the existence of mere trading companies admittedly does not yet entail any national respousibilines, no state obligations, will nevertheless, true to its principle, do everything to ensure that its subjects do not lose anything of what they have taken possession of and what they are striving for. The German interest in the Nyassa route, however, absolutely demands both that the development of a de facto monopoly, such as exists on the Riger, be prevented on the Zambezi-Nyassa, and that we not be kept completely away from the traffic in the south, i.e. that we receive our share of the coasts of the Nyassa and extend into the region of Lake Rikwa (recently visited by Consul Johnston),*) in the vicinity of which the so-called Lake Road passes. A division must not be made purely outwardly according to mathematically drawn lines, but also in relation to the traffic and the productive capacity of the landscapes. At Lake Muta Rsige and Lake Albert, the interests of Germany, England and the United States meet." The report on this journey has been published in the "Pro coodings of the Royal Geographical Society". The investigations show that the lake is much longer and extends further to the southwest than previously assumed. The lake is surrounded to the south and west by an almost flat plain, which varies in width from 15 to 30 miles, while high mountains rise on the eastern shore. The entire basin is surrounded by a wall of mountains, which rise abruptly either from the shore or from the plain. On the south-eastern corner there is a remarkable indentation which disappears into the mountains. The only river that flows into the Rikwa is the Songwe, a dirty little river whose source is very close to that of the other Songwe, which is a major river flowing into Lake Nyassa. The approximate height of the Rikwajee is 2900 feet, which agrees with previous observations. The water of the lake is brackish and hardly drinkable. It is inhabited by hippos and crocodiles and is very rich in fish. Elephants, buffaloes with exceptionally beautiful horns, zebras, various species of antelopes, lions, hyenas and enormous masses of guinea fowl, francolins and pigeons can be found on its charmless shores. They are indeed uninviting and almost uninhabitable by man. Johnston expressed his view of the land to the natives as being possessed by seven devils - hunger, thirst, dry wind, thorns, scorching sunlight, poisonous flies and bad people. The natives who inhabit the terrible, sun-scorched Edene south of Lake Rikwa are the Wajangu (the land itself is called Uwanga). They could plant nothing in their land, where no rain fell for two years, and therefore had to live simply by robbing and hunting wild animals, in which they are very skilled. Johnston left the country as soon as he could, as the thermometer in the shade was 79-99 degrees Fahrenheit day after day at midday, the water, even that of the Songwe, was salty, there was a lack of food and the whole caravan was in danger of falling ill D. R.

country and the Congo state. At Victoria Nyanza, the "Great Lake", on the other hand, only German and English claims stand in opposition to each other, and it is significant that, according to all previous travel reports, the countries of Uganda and soon Unjoro, the "interlake region", are certainly far ahead of all neighboring countries in terms of natural wealth, relative culture of the inhabitants and, in particular, historical and political significance. Whoever owns Uganda rules the whole of Nyanza; the kings of Uganda and of Unjoro, whose power has increased considerably in recent years, were and are the most powerful sovereigns in this region. We repeat, therefore, that it is not the party of the two negotiating parties which would get the most in terms of square kilometers that would have priority, but that a well-balanced consideration of all circumstances must take place. A division which seeks to truly unite the interests of both sides in the sense we have described above can be a thoroughly amicable one. England and Germany will remain dependent on each other in East Africa and will be at their best if they act together. Philanthropism will not be neglected under German rule any more than under English rule, and we for our part will be no less eager to eliminate the African "tato of barbariam" than our cousins on the other side of the Channel. The fact that Germany descended so late into the colonial arena is not due to a lack of ability to colonize, but only to the former lack of national unity. Africa, it says in the Morning Post, is likely to be - indeed, must be - the center of the world's attentions for a considerable time to come! Vr. Wiechmann=Ludwigslust. The Somali question. As our readers know, the last German expedition, which wanted to gain influence in northern Somalia, was not successful, as the Sultan Osman, apparently influenced by the intrigues of other powers and certainly aware of the Imperial Government's non-recognition of the treaties concluded with him by the German East African Company, refused to grant the members of the expedition the rights which they considered themselves entitled to claim on the basis of the private treaties and the Sultan's friendly relationship with the Germans. The Sultan has, so to speak, declared all previous treaties null and void, in a friendly but high-handed manner, but that the matter cannot and will not stand still, we confidently hope. It was a bold attempt to go to Halule, relying on the treaties apparently almost abandoned by the East African Company, and the efforts of Mr. Hoffmann, the government architect, truly deserved more support than they have received, for one day a race will arise among the colonial powers for the Somali corner, which will certainly make us regret that, instead of gaining a firm foothold there at the right time, we have stood idly by while other powers have seized this important point, which could secure our connection with the East African colony and the South Seas, into their sphere of influence. We are able to provide the following information about the expedition itself: The expedition had sailed from Aden on March 9th on the steamer "Majun" hired by Mr. Hoffmann, the government master builder, and landed in the roadstead of Halule on the 13th. The Sultan wished to see all the gentlemen of the expedition the next morning, but permission to go hunting was refused as the Medjertin were holding a big shauri. On the 14th the expedition went to Halule, which consists of about 1000 huts and two castle-like stone houses of very rough construction, one of which is inhabited by the Sultan, the other by Salach Mahmud, the son of the deceased first minister of the Sultan Osman. The solemn audience took place in the Sultan's palace in the state room, which is two stories high and decorated with a number of poor mirrors. The nobles of the Meljertin were seated on carpets along the walls, while the gentlemen of the expedition were seated on chairs. Mr. Hoffmann, in keeping with his dignity as head of the expedition, was unarmed; the other gentlemen carried sabres, as did the Medjertin. The sultan, who was somewhat delayed, was dressed in dark clothes; only his feet, whose nails were dyed with saffron, were bare; he kindly shook hands with the gentlemen of the expedition. Mr. v. Schöning spoke of the power and glory of Germany and indulged in exuberance, as is the general custom in the Orient and as Nur Oswan, an uncle of the Sultan and one of the most respected men among the people, who was given the floor after Mr. v. Schöning, also did. The conclusion of the speech, however, was that the gentlemen could remain as guests, but that they would neither be allowed to establish a station nor to make plantations. Although Mr. Hoffmann, the government architect, referred to Mr. Hörnecke's letter, nothing could be changed, so the gentlemen returned to the ship. In the evening Achmed Ali (Sementer) came to tell the gentlemen.
He told the gentlemen that the Suakrum tribe, a part of the Medjertin tribe, was completely on their side, that they considered themselves German and would stick to it. Salach Mahmud came after him with a companion and said that his father had joined the Germans with the Suakrum tribe and that he considered himself a German subject. Half of Obbia belonged to him, the other half had become Italian. He was prepared to do everything in his power to complete his father's work. On the 15th, Hoffmann went back to the Sultan, where the Medjertin were already assembled. The Sultan immediately gave Nur Osman, who was in the English pay, the work, which also decided the course of this conversation to the disadvantage of the gentlemen. The same answer was given as the day before; all protests were of no avail, although the Sultan was quite friendly. After the Shauri, Mr. Hoffmann went with Mr. Rühle to the other stone house at Salach, then to uchmed Ali and Said Sementer. On the 16th Mr. Hoffmann spoke to the Sultan alone, but he insisted on his earlier decision, so that after presenting the gifts, consisting of ceremonial sabres to the Sultan, Salach and Sementer, the return journey to Aden was begun. From there the expedition left for Zanzibar and then for Hohenzollernhafen. We will follow this up with an interesting letter addressed to us by Mr. Hörnecke, the government architect, which may serve to shed more light on the tribal relations of the Somali and their position in relation to the Germans. Mr. Hörnecke writes: With regard to the letter of Sultan Osman published in the last issue of the "Deutsche Kolonialzeitung", incidentally without my involvement,*) which has received such a varied assessment in the press, I would like to remark that its importance is often overestimated. Sultan Osman, too, uses language not only to express his thoughts, but also to conceal them where it seems expedient to him. When I had my first audience with Sultan Osman in 1885 when I was in Halule together with Lieutenant Klaus von Anderten, we received a similar response. An Uradian, however, with whom I later became very friendly and who repeatedly gave me very effective support in very critical situations, induced us to wait and see. With his help we finally succeeded in persuading the Grand Fulian Osman and the most influential chiefs, especially the old vizier, Mahmud Hassan, to conclude the treaty of friendship. The Somalis wanted the Germans to make similar arrangements in Halule to those made by the British in Aden, hence their demand for German mail steamers to call there regularly. Moreover, they considered the Germans, who had so brilliantly defeated the French, to be the most powerful nation, and it flattered them to be allied with them. The treaty was initially concluded in secret, but it soon became known, and now a counter-party was immediately formed under the leadership of some uninvolved chiefs, who spread the rumor that Ooman had sold the Somalis to the Germans and gained a large following. Now numerous representatives of the neighboring tribes were called together as quickly as possible and the treaty was signed in a large open-air meeting. It was fully approved, the rebels were punished, and after my departure from Halule, Mr. von Anderten left alone. He completed the treaty with the signature of Sulian Jussul, who was the most influential chieftain after the vizier and had gained great prestige, especially during Osman's minority. He used to spend a large part of the year in Obbia. When Mr. von Anderten was sent to the south, Mr. Vieter took his place as representative of the German East African Society. He alternated between Halule and Aden. However, a more intensive exploitation of the contract did not take place, as the company did not want to fragment its resources. When I was General Director of the Company in Zanzibar in 1886/87, the Vizier Mayuud Hafsan stayed with me for a long time as a guest in the Company's house, whereas previously he had always been the guest of the Sultan of Zanzibar. He very much wanted us to keep our promises regarding Somaliland and to set up stations in Obbia as well as in Halule; he offered to take officials and building materials with him in his ship. At that time I consoled him about Dr. Juhike's expedition, which was being prepared and was destined for Somaliland. Dr. Jühike also visited Halule, but first wanted to acquire the southern Benadir coast for Germany, where he met such an unfortunate end. When Dr. Peters went out to German East Africa in the spring of 1887, he entrusted the Somali Muhamed Said Sementer in Halule, whose hospitality Mr. von Anderten and I had enjoyed, with the expulsion of the Dene Jnieressen in return for a one-year salary. As far as I know, he is still in the same position today. In the meantime, the people and thus the circumstances in Somaliland have changed. In particular, the death of old Mahund Haffan, whom I regarded as one of our main supporters, seems to have been significant. Other men now seem to have gained the respect of Sultan Osman and to have been persuaded by foreign powers to oppose German interests. Sultan Jussuff has fallen away and is said to have ceded Obbia, of which he only owns half (the other half belongs to Mahmud Hassan's son), to the Italians. It is not yet known whether Sultan Osman gave his consent to this. Given the great distance of this place from Halule, it was considered a colony for many years. The sons of Mahmud Hassan and Jussuf Ali had to fight hard battles here, which only came to an end when they took the daughters of the local chiefs as wives. Has Sultan Jussuf really been won over by the Italians and will he be married by *) The editors had received the communication from a source which they had to assume was entitled to publish the letter without Mr. Hörnecke's special consent.

If the Germans support him, he may succeed in overthrowing the Grand Sultan Osman and also play Holule into the hands of the Italians, if Osman himself does not throw himself into their arms. In any case, there is still a powerful German party in Somaliland, especially in Halule, which clings to the old treaty, and if it is supported in the strongest possible way, Somaliland, as long as it is still free, will be won back for us just as quickly as it now seems lost. But if anything is to happen, it must happen soon. The Great South. The southern border areas. From the earlier remarks on the "Great South" it was evident that the Rusiji and the Ulanga River offer very useful traffic routes to the interior, and that valuable natural resources, namely coal and iron, are to be found in apparently large quantities on the Rovuma River, and perhaps also further inland. It is now a matter of determining whether the land between these two rivers also has some value, as well as what interest the area to the west of Lake Nyassa has for us. So far we know very little about the land between Rusiji and Rovuma. We owe the first news to our compatriots Dr. Roscher and v. d. Decken, who in the years 1859 and 1860 advanced from Kilwa in a south-westerly direction to Lake Nyassa, where Roscher met his death at the hands of an assassin shortly after his arrival, while v. d. Decken died as a result of his Arabs' activities. Decken only made it as far as Mesule, about a third of the way from the coast, due to the activities of his Arab companions and then turned back to turn his exploration activities more to the northern regions of the Zanzibar coast, where he also met a bloody end five years later, after he had happily achieved the goal of his quest to find a land suitable for German settlements with a good traffic route into the interior. According to v. d. Decken's reports, 1) which alone can serve us for this purpose, the land up to Mesule is mostly fertile and well cultivated; on Roscher's route, the numerous names of villages or population centers suggest similar conditions, although it should not be forgotten that further inland, where the Arabs carried out their raids in later years for the purpose of catching slaves, many a previously flourishing landscape is now probably completely deserted. All we know about the climatic conditions is that heavy rains fall towards the end of the year, just as they do on the entire Swahili coast. The fevers from which v. d. Decken and Roscher suffered were probably brought from Kilwa-Kisiwani, the starting point of both travelers, which is recognized as very unhealthy. We find confirmation for this assumption in the experiences of the English missionary W. G. Porter, who in 1884, as in the past, traveled from the Madjeg Mountains (38 degrees east longitude) in relation to the Masasi mission station on the northern shore of the Rovuma River, through the country in a west-northwesterly direction to the village of the Magwangwara chief Sonjela, half a degree east of the northern end of Lake Nyassa, without, however, reaching this inland sea itself. Rev. Porter, who was able to get along well with the natives, did not mention the slightest nuisance from illness and completed the entire journey there and back without any accidents. He also often found native dwellings, but his route, at least in the second half, mostly led through extensive and fairly dense forest, which speaks for the excellent irrigation of this area. He crossed Roscher's route westwards from Minioka, a few days' journey beyond Mesule, but here he often only found the names of the villages mentioned by Roscher, which is probably also a consequence of the Arab slave hunts, although these have their main location further inland, in the land of the Hiao, south of the Rovuma River. From the above information, however meagre, it is at least clear that the land between Rufiji and Rovuma is a land that has not been neglected by nature, and that further exploration of it should be both instructive and rewarding. The natural starting points for this are provided by the two large rivers on the northern and southern borders. The lower course of the Rovuma is, apart from the mouth, also easily accessible from Mikindanibay and Lindi, as we know from the reports of the French engineer Angelvy3) and the well-known *) S. v. d. Deckens Reisen, vol. 1 p. 161 *) Comptes Rend.es of the Socisté de Geographie de Paria, June 5, 1885.
English traveler W. P. Johnson; there are numerous villages here, of which the aforementioned mission station Masasi is probably the most important. The confluence of the large southern tributary Ludjenda, which rises near Lake Shirwa or Kilwa to the south of Nyassa and apparently forms a good outlet channel for the products of the land to the south of the Rovuma (which is mainly coveted and explored by the English), is likely to become important one day. The Rusiji will probably initially be best accessed through its estuaries, while later a railroad through the fertile Rufu or Kingani valley from Bagamoyo to the knee at the confluence of the western main tributary Rueha will in all probability offer the most convenient route for the products of the Ulanga=Rufiji. Dar=es=Salaam, despite its good harbor, will probably be of no importance as a shipping point for the trading area of Rusiji, because no such rich, well-developed hinterland leads from here to the southwest, and the importance of the two Kilwas will probably remain very subordinate once the natural accesses to the interior have been developed, in particular that of the very unhealthy Kilwa=Kisiwani, which was built on an island according to the outdated recipe of the first Arab and Portuguese settlers for fear of attacks by the natives, like so many other villages on this coast that no longer meet today's requirements. Of no less importance for our colonization efforts are the countries in the west of the Nyassa, from the southern tip of Tanganyika along the eastern border of the Congo state to Lake Bemba or Bangweolo. In this area, the southern border would still have to be determined by international agreements, while in the eastern province of Rovuma and further on, from its last fork, a line extending south from the port of Mbampa on Lake Nyassa forms the recognized border towards the Portuguese colony of Mozambique. In the western part of the country we are now concerned with, a suitable borderline would be approximately 13° F latitude or a line running parallel to it from the southern end of the Bangweolo River to Unaka Bay on Lake Nyassa, while the Congo State or the lands conceded to it up to Kasembe's empire would have to form the borders to the west. Who our southern neighbors would be, whether the Portuguese alone, or the latter in the eastern part and the English in the western, would depend on the agreements to be reached between these two nations within a short time, and would be of no essential importance to us, since that is all that matters to us for the time being, the south-westernmost part of our East African protectorate the necessary capacity for development, as well as to obtain the possibility of having a permanently open connection with the countries on the Congo and upper Zambezi that are still independent and across these to Damara and Ovamboland, Germany's West African protectorate. Access to this vast and certainly promising area leads through the relatively narrow strip of land between the northern tip of Lake Nyassa and the southern tip of Lake Tanganyika and is also restricted to the east by an extensive mountain range and to the west by Lake Rikwa or Lake Leopold. Only a few exploratory trains of travelers enter this area from the north. First and foremost is Giraud, who (1883) roamed the land between Usagara and Lakes Bangweolo, Moero and Tanganyika. The isthmus between the nearest points of Nyassa and Tanganyika, which incidentally is now crossed by a usable road, was explored by the much-traveled Thomson, among others, while in the southwest we encounter the traces of the great explorer Livingstone alongside those of various Portuguese explorers. Of course, despite the work of all these pioneers, much remains to be done if the economic development of this rich area and its actual integration into the core of our East African possessions is to be steered in the right direction; That this is not possible under the present traffic conditions and the present development of our relations with the interior of East Africa hardly needs to be mentioned, but that our goal, which is also very desirable in the interest of suppressing slave hunting, can be achieved without too much difficulty, will be shown in the following. With the present energetic and purposeful approach in East Africa, it is probably no doubt that Mpuapua will soon become the most important center for all further progress*) Thømson, O. Reill (1882). Maples (1881), Johnson Bishop Steere (1875), Livingstene (1866).

The route will have to go inland, and its connection with some suitable coastal point, perhaps through the valley of the Wami River, must very soon be made fast and absolutely secure, whether by a simply built railroad, which would probably be best, or by a good road equipped with numerous refreshment and renewal stations (stages and Relaio). It is also clear that the main station for the northern lake district will be Tabora, which is well connected to Mpuapua and from where the road leads westwards to Udjidji on the Tanganyika and northwards to the countries in the south and west of the Ukerewe (Victoria=Nyanza). However, the importance of Mpuapua and the road to be built from the coast to there will be considerably increased if a station is established in the southwest, in the narrow neck between Lake Nyassa and Lake Tanganyika, which would have to form the center for the development of the southern part of the East African Lake District for our area, just as Tabora does for the northwest. If we compare the corresponding hinterlands, there can be no doubt that the headwaters of the Congo will in future have at least the same importance as the northern lake district, which can be reached via Tabora, even if we include Uganda, which is highly coveted by the British; Likewise, since we do not yet have more precise research, a glance at the map teaches us that a connection between Mpuapua and the south-west station just mentioned cannot be too difficult, whether one follows the valley of the Rueha River or the lines indicated to us by Giraud's travels to the south-east and Elton's inquiries to the north-east. It would be going too far if we were to examine from all sides the importance of this area, which is still so little explored in economic terms in relation to the northwest; however, we would not like to conclude without pointing out the urgent need to have this area explored as soon and as thoroughly as possible by a suitably composed expedition and to examine its value for our colonization work. Of course, if the results of this expedition are satisfactory, there should also be sufficient good will and strength to hold on to what has been recognized as valuable and, even if only very gradually, to bring it into ever closer contact with our East African coastal areas. This is just as necessary as it will be unavoidable to formulate and implement a clear plan within the shortest possible time with regard to the northern part of our East African protectorate, which extends from Witu beyond the upper reaches of the Djuba and must be secured against encroachments from the British and Italian side, if this last declaration of protection, which was made only towards the end of last year, is to have any meaning and purpose at all, for it is beyond doubt that an overseas acquisition which is poorly limited and incapable of development can only be a burden to the mother country, but can never be useful. If we now take a look back at the future relationship of the "Great South" to the center of our East African colony, which will probably be located in the bay opposite Sanstbar for all time to come, because this is where the most important traffic routes converge, the first result is that the Rusiji=Ulanga with its hinterlands stands in approximately the same relationship to the central Mpuapua=Wamilinie as the Pangani together with Kilimanjaro and the Masai countries, only with the difference that the former river area, which also points straight to the above-mentioned center of the colony through the Rufuthal, is incomparably more important than that of the small Pangani. The Rovuma area, which will soon come into consideration, with the lands to the northwest of the Nyassasces, would not initially be directly connected to the aforementioned coastal transportation hub and would occupy a similar position in this respect, The south-western lake district, finally, between the northern half of the Nyassa and Lakes Moëro and Bangweolo, with the Luapula River, which is to be regarded as one of the main source rivers of the Congo and which I have repeatedly described as particularly important, would have the same relationship to the Mpuapua-Wamiline as the countries on the lakes to the west and north of Tabora; it would supply its products to this main military and trade route of central East Africa and would certainly contribute in no small measure to securing an appropriate return in the first instance, if the latter is to be considered more for the construction of such a railroad than its strategic and cultural importance, or than its influence on the development of the country, the development of traffic and the suppression of the dubious slave hunts. O. K.
But transportation routes in East Africa. (With map.) Shortly after the acquisition of our East African territory, the question of the means of transportation was addressed several times in the circles involved. It is well known that to this day the only means of transportation in East Africa is man. All goods, from the coast to the interior and in the opposite direction, are transported by porters. When one considers the immense amount of labor, which could otherwise be better utilized, that is drained from the country by the fact that many thousands of regers are employed as caravan carriers year in and year out, and when one considers the extraordinarily long time that is required to transport the goods to their destination, which makes a lively turnover of goods virtually impossible, the idea of creating better transport routes was only a natural one. Two points come into consideration here: water and land transportation. As far as the first point is concerned, the waterways of a country undoubtedly provide the natural and easiest direction for the development of transportation routes. If we take a look at the numerous waterways that cut through our East African territory, we are struck by the disconcerting phenomenon that they are used little or not at all for transportation. The reasons for this are probably to be found in the fact that the current velocity of some of these rivers is very high, that rapids frequently interrupt navigation and that the water level varies greatly depending on the season. However, water traffic is also influenced by the water level, because in the flat country, where in the wet season the rivers often flood the land over a wide area and later form unhealthy riparian districts, cultivation must be restricted to the higher parts of the country, which are often miles away from the riverbanks. In this case, it is usually more advantageous to give preference to overland transportation. After all, modern culture would probably be able to overcome most of these obstacles and allow at least partial practical utilization of our East African waterways. Water transportation alone, however, will never be able to bring about the rational development of a country; land transportation routes are also absolutely necessary, all the more so because the rivers of East Africa have so far contributed so little to the development of culture there. The overland transport routes found in East Africa - the caravan routes - are nothing more than footpaths that crisscross the country in countless bends over mountains and valleys, crossing streams and rivers at random, at a width of about 1 meter. Such traffic routes, on which the traveler with his load still struggles to move forward everywhere, do not meet the needs of modern culture. First and foremost, we need to think of drivable roads and then railroads. First of all, we want to imagine roads as 5-6 meter wide paths, with a driving surface that, where the nature of the ground requires it, is laid down with stones and wood and carefully drained on the sides. Two- or four-wheeled oxcarts are used for transportation. In Southeast Africa, such a cart pulled by 15-20 oxen can carry a load of up to 50 hundredweight, i.e. about 80 loads, on level roads. If one wanted to proceed with the construction of such roads for wagon traffic in East Africa, one would naturally first have to follow the caravan routes from the coast. The work to be carried out for this would extend to: Deforestation, rock blasting, construction of small fixed bridges, construction of a fixed railroad, and preliminary channels for the drainage of surface water. Even taking into account the low wage rates in East Africa, such a reasonably usable road could not be built for less than 500 marks per kilometer. The road from Lewa to Tschogwe on the Pangan project was estimated at around 250 marks per kilometer at the time. However, this sum seems to me to be far too low and would probably have been sufficient at best to create a reasonably usable road during the dry season. The following one-off costs would also have to be added: the cost of procuring the draught oxen and the wagon material as well as the construction of stables, etc. Assuming the favorable case that the strong mountain oxen bred in Usambara also thrived in the Edene and could be used as draft animals, they would cost about 45 marks per 2 oxen, while the wagon, even if the box is made on the spot, could probably not be procured for less than 600 marks. A complete cart with 16 oxen including harness would therefore cost around 1400 marks. On top of this, there were the running costs: Wages and food for the wagoners, wear and tear on the wagons, and food for the draught oxen in areas that do not provide grass that can be used as fodder, such as the stretch between Lewa and the coast, or the plain west of the Pare Mountains. If the maintenance costs per wagon and day are estimated at 10 marks, this results in a sum of around 3700 marks per year. Added to this are the maintenance costs for the road at around 40 marks per kilometer per year. For a road of approx. 30 kilometers in length regularly used by 2 carts, i.e. from Pangani to Lewa, the following would result: Construction costs for the road and stables, as well as the procurement of operating materials would be around 19,000 marks, maintenance costs around 9,000 marks per year. However, it should be noted that such an operation with wagons would only achieve a more comfortable and somewhat cheaper, but only insignificantly faster transportation. A significantly faster turnover and actual development, also of the hinterland, can only be achieved by railroads. -This is not intended to suggest that

Page 118

 It may be emphasized, not only that the development of a country can be achieved by railroads alone, but also, in view of what has been said so far, that the sooner the better, we must proceed simultaneously with the construction and utilization of various types of land and water transport routes. If in the following I venture into the somewhat difficult field of railroad construction in East Africa and submit positive proposals to a wider circle of readers, I ask that they be regarded as a first attempt to solve this important question under the given circumstances. When the London Treaty was concluded between the participating powers in November 1886 on the basis of the acquisitions of the German East African Company, the idea of proceeding with the construction of cane railroads for the cultural development of the newly acquired territories was already emerging in enterprising minds. But as beautiful as all these plans were, they had to remain gray theory as long as we were not actually the masters of the land. The original plan was to build a railroad line from the treaty port of Dar=es=Salaam to Farbani, the junction of the caravan routes from Saadani and Bagamoyo, in the direction of Mpuapua and Tabora. The necessary technical preparations had already begun when the rebellion, which was already secretly organized at the time, put an end to them. From another side, the construction of a railroad along the Rusiji and its left tributary, the Ulanga, using the navigable routes of these rivers, and finally the construction of a railroad to Kilimadjaro were considered. The uprising that broke out in August 1883 naturally had to put all these plans on the back burner for the time being; the main priority here was to put down the uprising and restore Germany's lost reputation. Now, after a year of hard but victorious fighting, we can actually consider ourselves the masters of the country - at least in the northern part of our territory. Trade and commerce are beginning to flourish again under favorable auspices and German capital can rightly be encouraged to participate in the development of the northern provinces by creating transport routes. The often-heard assertion that a railroad line in East Africa could not yet be profitable must be countered with the fact that such an assertion is a complete misunderstanding of the purpose and value of a pioneer railroad. A railroad of this kind is intended to open up the country and make it possible to transport many products that could otherwise never reach the coast. We must also take into account that in many cases there is already more cultivation in the interior than is necessary to support the inhabitants, for how could the thousands of porters who cross the country year in, year out make a living? If, on the other hand, there are railroads, the caravan traffic naturally ceases and the foodstuffs available in the interior, such as maize, mtama, sirocco, etc., flow off to the coast. At the same time, however, the thousands of porters also lost their livelihoods. The consequence of this will be that the raider, born of necessity and not of his own instincts, will be forced to cultivate his field himself and thus become a sedentary farmer. This latter advantage seems particularly worthy of attention, as it brings us a significant step closer to the all-important solution of the labor question in East Africa. In the following considerations, the Rufiji/Ulanga line mentioned above will not be taken into account, as it has not yet been sufficiently researched and the area there is not yet sufficiently secure, although it may be of great importance later on. The situation is different and more favorable for the lines to Tabora and Kilima-Adjaro. Tabora is the center of the caravan trade between the Great Lakes and the coast and at the same time the main base of the Arabs. Major Wißmann recognized the importance of this point very well and has already advanced a fortified military station to Mpuapua, i.e. up to about 300 kilometers to the north, on the major caravan route leading there from Bagamoyo. Whether Tabora will also be militarily occupied in the foreseeable future depends on various circumstances. In any case, a forceful approach would require a not insignificant military force by African standards, quite apart from the fact that, given Tabora's distance from the coast, approx. 800 kilometers, extensive equipment and provisions would have to be provided for the station. Perhaps the occupation of Tabora will also take place peacefully on the occasion of the expedition to be led by Emin to Viktoria Nyanza and with the cooperation of Tippu Tipp, with whom, according to newspaper reports, connections are said to have been established. Without the military occupation of Tabora, the construction of a railroad line there is hardly possible. Otherwise, if the construction of a railroad is only considered as far as Mpuapua or Farhani, profitability is unlikely to be guaranteed, even after a number of years, as the vast majority of export products are either extracted in a remote area, relatively close to the coast, or, like ivory and rhinoceros horns, deep in the interior. It should also be noted that even a narrow-gauge railroad to Tabora would cost at least 24 million marks, and one to Mpuapua about 9 million marks. For this latter sum, however, it would almost be possible to build a narrow-gauge railroad from the Oft Coast through the fertile Usambara to the much-praised Kilima=Ndscharo=area. The

Given the possibility of raising the capital in question, there should not be much doubt as to which of the two lines should be preferred. I have chosen Tanga as the starting point for the Kilima-Rajaro Railway to be discussed in more detail below and have assumed that the line will run along the Sigi River to the Bondei Mountains, then east of them via Magila to Lewa, from there following the great caravan route to Masinde, from here to Mikotscheni on the Ruwu and finally along this river to Klein-Aruscha. This line has a total length of approx. 360 kilometers and could be constructed as a narrow-gauge railroad for an estimated 10 million marks, i.e. 28,000 marks per kilometer. First of all, the main requirement appears to be that the starting point of the line is a port. However, only Tanga can be considered for this, as the river barrage in front of Pangani only offers a narrow passage for medium-draught ships at high tide. Although the populated Pangani is currently much more important as a trading center than Tanga, these conditions would soon change in favour of Tanga if a railroad were available. In the period from August 18, 1888 to August 17, 1889, i.e. during the uprising, when trade was extremely depressed, exports from Tanga and Pangani amounted to 210,000 and 700,000 marks respectively, while imports to the same places amounted to 170,000 and 180,000 marks respectively. If one considers that the great bulk of the products exported from Pangani, such as ivory, rhinoceros horns, rhinoceros grains, and other products, were not exported. rhinoceros horns, cattle, sheep, goats, cattle hides, timber. Butter and feit, worth over 530,000 marks, are obtained either from Kilima=Ndjaro and west of it, or from Usambara, while of the other more important export products, such as molasses, honey, sesame, copra, sirocco (green peas), mtama, firewood and some others, with a total value of 130,000 marks, at most ¾ of this value, i.e. for 100,000 marks, is obtained from the lower Pangani valley and the coastal districts north and south of Pangani, it follows that the value of these latter products is at most ½ of that coming from the interior. It should also be noted that the products from the Pangani valley and the coastal district usually prefer the cheaper waterway or short land transportation, even if a railroad is available. As far as imports to Tanga and Pangani are concerned, as the above figures show, the ratio is already extraordinarily favorable, as Pangani had an import surplus of about 10,000 marks; and this surplus resulted from the import of powder required for the station equipment. cartridges, furniture, wooden goods and canned goods with a total value of approx. 12,000 marks. However, once there is a railroad from Tanga, even only as far as Masinde, the imports will naturally mainly be made from Tanga, which would mean that the railroad line would have to handle extensive shipments. In order to direct the trade from Pangani and the clove-rich island of Pemba, which is only 70 km from the mainland, to Tanga, it would be advisable to set up a service between Tanga and Pangani or Tanga and Pemba with small, flat-bottomed steamers of 200-250 tons, as suggested by Captain Holtz. A coastal railroad between Tanga and Pangani, as proposed by Captain von Hake at the time, would probably have to be dispensed with for the time being in view of the low traffic, and the construction of such a railroad would have to be reserved for later times. Another advantage of choosing Tanga over Pangani that should not be underestimated is that Tanga is much more accessible to Europeans than Pangani, which is surrounded by swamps. If a joint-stock railroad company were to be founded for the construction of the proposed railroad line, it would be absolutely necessary, as it would go hand in hand with trading and plantation companies in order to create a certain, albeit initially small, traffic. The East African Plantation Company, which has been in existence for several years, has already resumed its activities, but there are still no German trading companies on the mainland. If, for example, one of the German companies based in Sanstbar were to set up a factory in Tanga, this would paralyze the intermediate trade, which is so profitable for the Jndians, and make it possible to establish direct trade with the natives on the coast and in the interior. Especially in Tanga, the conditions for this are extremely favorable, since here, in contrast to Pangani, the influence of the Arab element is almost zero and the Reger represents the propertied class. Provided that Tanga, like Dar=es=Salaam, would also be considered as a landing point for the new mail steamer line, Germany could secure a considerably larger share of trade in exports and imports than here. To the extent that the establishment of such commercial establishments proves successful, they could be enlarged and pushed further inland along the railroad line, which would ultimately achieve the advantage that Sanstbar, with its open roadstead, which is unfavorably situated for unloading ship cargoes, would be almost completely excluded from German trade. In Tanga, however, a stone dam and jetty would have to be built down to the deeper water to allow goods and products to be loaded and unloaded easily. To give us an idea of how much money the Indians earn from the ivory trade alone, for example, I will quote the following: A porter receives an average monthly wage of 5 Maria=Theresienthaler at 3.20 Marks, i.e. 0.55 Marks per day; in addition, the caravan leader has to pay 0.20 Mari per day for food, which brings the costs for a porter per day to about 0.75 Marks. The ivory exports from Tanga and Pangani in the previous trading year amounted to a total of about 46,000 pounds, for which about 760 porters were needed. If one takes into account that, including the handling of the exchange transactions from Pangani to Kilima=Adjaro and back, about 55 days are required, the costs for the 760 porters mentioned are calculated at 760 X 55 X 0.75 - approx. 31,300 marks. Now the ivory is exchanged in the interior for goods at a maximum rate of 2 marks per pound. So the 46,000 pounds of ivory to the coast cost: 46,000 X 2 + 31,300 +4700 marks other expenses - total: 128,000 marks; plus a total tax of approx. 20 percent, resulting in a sum of 153,600 marks or approx. 31 marks per pound. At Sanstbar, however, a pound is sold for 7-10 marks; the farmers concerned therefore earn 110-200 percent, i.e. in this case 168,000 or 306,000 marks. In reality, however, the earnings are even higher, as the price of the ivory inside varies between 1.20-2.00 marks, depending on the quality. If there were a railroad to Kilima=Ndscharo, the caravan trade would naturally cease and why should the Germans not be able to conclude these advantageous trade transactions with the natives in the interior themselves? However, other aspects were also decisive for the route of the railroad line I proposed: In order to open up a country, the railroad line in question must be routed in such a way that it cuts through the country and touches as many points as possible that ensure a stimulation and increase in trade. Such points are the market places of the natives. Every week or every 14 days the traders bring their goods here to exchange them from the natives for local products. These markets are often visited by 1000-2000 people. Although there are no illusions about the size of the turnover for the time being, the best can be hoped for in the future, especially if factories can be brought here with the help of the railroad. Larger market places are located, for example, 1) at Amboni west of Tanga, 2) del the English mission station Umba, 3) at Mtangata south of Magila, 4) at Pangani, 7 kilometers south of Lewa, 5) at Korogwe, 12 kilometers east of the confluence of the Mkomasi with the Ruwu and 6) dei Masinde in western Usambara. The products exported from Usambara by rail would initially include: Beef skins, rubber. Copal, copra, sesame, mtama, sirocco, oreille, molasses, butter and fat, cattle, sheep, goats and timber. Tobacco and cotton from the plantations would be added in later times, quite apart from the fact that the export of other products, namely cattle and timber, would increase enormously. So mainly cattle, maize, peas and beans would be exported from here. This route would therefore promise only low profitability. The Ugueno Mountains are rich in iron; I was shown numerous tools made by the natives, such as pots, kettles, spades, rakes, etc., as well as swords and spears. The two jagga spears and a sword given to Dr. Jühlke and myself by Mandara were made by blacksmiths in the Ugueno Mountains. This branch of industry has been in decline for years, but I am convinced that all that is needed is to create the necessary connections to revive it. I can only repeat here what I said about the Kilima-Adjaro region in 1885 in "My Journey to the Kilima-Adjaro Region" - it is the paradise of East Africa. This assertion is no exaggeration; the numerous travelers who have since visited this wonderful mountain landscape, which combines a northern and tropical climate, have only confirmed the assertion anew. Here we come into contact with a strong, found and free people. Here we find a grateful field of activity for German labor and German intelligence. If in Usambara I would like to describe only a few places, such as the fertile surroundings of Fuga, as places where the Enroväer can live and work, then in the Kilima=Njaro region there is a district of certainly 50 square miles which offers this possibility. It would be possible to settle a large number of European families here and at the same time find a sanatorium that one could not wish for better. From it would be exported: splendid timber, sugar cane, tobacco. Beans, corn, millet, honey, butter, cattle, sheep, goats, will and later almost all European vegetables. Our zoological gardens, which now obtain live animals from the Sudan and Abyssinia for often enormous sums, could also cover part of their needs with the abundance of game in Kilima=Ndjaro. Finally, ivory and rhinoceros horns would be valuable export articles. - I have suggested that the railroad line be routed west of the Pare Mountains because we often cross into the English sphere of interest and, with the exception of a few small dunes, would have to pass through a stony region with little water, in which the construction of water stations would encounter difficulties It would also be desirable to secure the railway line with military stations in Arusha and near Masinde. Despite all the assurances of friendship, I consider Zimbodia and its son Kimwere in particular to be very insecure allies, despite all the assurances of friendship; they will instigate unrest and cause trouble for the Germans wherever and whenever they can.

I would like to discuss the closely related question of which crops are most suitable for New Guinea and try to answer it as far as possible. If one asks: Which crops are most suitable for New Guinea, or which promise the most success and profit, what should we cultivate? it is not possible to give a definite answer to this so easily and in a few words. Nevertheless, it is possible to set out some general points of view for deciding these questions, and we can name some crops which, according to the state of the world market and the conditions prevailing in New Guinea, deserve our attention for cultivation before others. It goes without saying that we must strive above all to always produce the best, the most excellent varieties, as these will always find buyers and fetch good prices, however crowded the market may be. This is particularly true of tobacco, a product that promises to be of great importance for New Guinea. It is essential that we produce only first quality, only the finest tobaccos in New Guinea, because only then can we successfully compete with other tadak producing countries, which usually have a much more numerous and cheaper labor force at their disposal. However, since the tobacco cultivation trials carried out so far have led to quite satisfactory results, we should not hesitate to establish a second deli in New Guinea if the verdict on the new harvest is equally favorable. The cotton grown in New Guinea has also received a very favorable assessment. It seems to me to be particularly desirable and worthwhile to succeed in producing as much of the cotton consumed by Germany's spinning mills as possible in the German colonies themselves. The cotton culture has the great advantage that a large part of the manual labor can be replaced by machine work, a circumstance that must not be ignored in view of the labor shortage in New Guinea. Further advantages are that the facilities for sowing and for housing and preparing the harvest are simple and cheap, and finally that the cotton can be harvested, prepared and sold just a few months after sowing, and that the capital, as with tobacco, flows back into the hands of the entrepreneur in a relatively short time. The tobacco and cotton plantations will generally be planted in the lowlands, and possibly, for the sake of easier cultivation, in the extended plains; at least one is not forced to go to the heights for these crops. Of the mountain crops, coffee and cocoa promise particularly good success in New Guinea; the soil and climate are favorable to them; the enormous mountains of volcanic origin allow a wide choice of location for the plantations; they undoubtedly offer the best conceivable soil for coffee and cocoa over long distances. The slopes and fertile valleys facing the rainy winds are ideal for cocoa, while the side of the mountains facing away from the humid winds is drier and therefore more suitable for cocoa. The growing area of both cocoa and cassee in other colonies is limited; in the case of cocoa, this is due to the special demands it places on climate and soil, so that it cannot be grown successfully in many tropical regions, and so there is no need to fear overwhelming competition from other colonies. The cultivation area of coffee has been greatly restricted by the spread of the coffee leaf curculio (Hemileia vastatrix), especially in two of the most important and best coffee countries, Ceylon and Java, in such a way that new coffee plantations in Ceylon no longer take place at all and in Java only cautiously and to a limited extent. It has been shown everywhere that coffee on the best and least depleted (and volcanic) soil has been able to resist the leaf disease far better than coffee on poorer (and non-volcanic) soil. This is why coffee cultivation in Ceylon has been almost completely destroyed, while in the better soil of Java, and especially in the rich volcanic soil of Central Sumatra, numerous coffee plantations have still produced satisfactory yields despite years of attacks by Hemileia and despite the devastation it has caused. A slow reduction in coffee production in the English and Dutch Indies will probably be the result of the cashew disease in the next few years, in a similar way to bioher. Furthermore, it is foreseeable that, as a result of the conditions prevailing in Brazil, coffee production in this main coffee-producing country will not make any progress for many years to come, and may even decline significantly. And yet coffee consumption has risen steadily in recent years. With this tendency towards increased demand on the one hand and reduced production on the other, good coffee prices can certainly be expected for many years to come.
Since coffee prices have always been relatively high, i.e. in comparison with production costs, so that coffee growers have always had a rich profit, good coffee plantations promise very rich yields in the coming years. For all these reasons, I strongly recommend the immediate establishment of extensive coffee plantations in New Guinea. Even if the first harvest of the cash crop does not take place until the fourth year after the sowing of the seed cash crop, the price of coffee will in all probability remain good for a much longer period, so that even plantations that are only planted now will reap the full benefit of the favorable situation of the coffee market. For tea, the outlook is less favorable, production continues to increase considerably, prices are low and are expected to fall even further. Nevertheless, a not too extensive cultivation trial with tea should be carried out, as it might be possible to obtain a fine product, and such a trial might pay off. A trial cultivation of thee involves few costs and can be completed in a relatively short time. I would even recommend a small trial planting of cinchona, although not in the opinion that we will be able to grow cinchona on a large scale in New Guinea in the near future. But it is worth the effort to know what qualities the country can produce, and then I consider it valuable to have stem plantations of all kinds in the country itself for more favorable times, which, one does not know how, can come overnight, in order to be able to procure seedlings, seeds, etc. from them easily and quickly. Of course, one would have to go to heights of about 5000 feet for the tea and cinchona trial plantings in order to achieve the best possible results. Peppercorns, nutmegs, cloves, vanilla, cardamom and the like tend to yield abundant profits. However, with the exception of peppercorns, these spices are less suitable for sole cultivation in large plantations than for smaller settlers or as a side crop with other crops. In my opinion, they will all produce satisfactory results in New Guinea in terms of the quality and quantity of the harvest; nutmegs and cloves will thrive above the others, as the climate is particularly suitable for them. I would recommend that missionaries and officials devote some of their free time to the cultivation of such spices. The planting of a few nutmeg trees in the vicinity of homes and in gardens is recommended because the nutmeg tree is one of the most beautiful and densest ornamental and shade trees in the tropics. With the steady expansion of artificial butter production in Germany, the demand for anatto, a colorant mainly used for coloring butter and cheese, will also increase considerably, and it is well worth considering whether now, when this industry is about to experience a lively upswing following the invention of a process for using coconut oil to make artificial butter, would not be a suitable time to plant a large anatto plantation in New Guinea. There is an experimental plantation of anatto in Finschhafen; cultivation trials that I carried out there in 1887 and 1888 were very satisfactory. The cultivation of anatto is easy and simple, bad harvests are practically impossible, the harvest begins just two years after sowing; the equipment for processing the harvest and preparing the color stock is not particularly expensive, and the monetary profit from growing anatto is, according to the growers whose anatto plantations I looked at, quite satisfactory. The main difficulty will be to find people who are familiar with the preparation of the fard. Perhaps the cultivation of areca nuts on a large scale, as it is often practiced by Europeans in other colonies, can also be recommended for New Guinea. This crop will certainly be worthwhile if we find a good market for areca nuts in Suradaya; however, I am not currently informed whether this will be the case. I mention this crop mainly because I have often seen it grown together with cocoa and coffee, in such a way that the very densely planted areca palms provide shade for the cocoa and coffee trees underneath them. Even if the areca palm is not a very excellent shade tree, it has the advantage over most of the other shade trees that are otherwise used that it produces a not inconsiderable yield of fruit. I therefore believe that it is well worth trying to use the areca palm extensively as a shade tree when establishing plantations in New Guinea.

We also have to pay attention to the extraction of so-called bush products. I do not believe that there will be any significant timber exports to Europe in the near future. But the demand in our own country will always be greater, and much greater than one might think at first glance. In any case, we must beware of the useless devastation of timber stocks. If I am not mistaken, however, we will be able to obtain good, valuable rottan in large quantities; the hinterland, for example, is rich in usable, pencil-thin rottan from Stephansort. But for this, as well as for the extraction of rubber, resins, bark, etc., we need the help of the natives and the mediation of colored middlemen. The extraction of bush products is not worthwhile with our own workers or if the white trader himself is to negotiate the small batches from the natives. - Coir has not yet been produced on a large scale in New Guinea; perhaps the establishment of a factory for the preparation of coir would pay off very well; first of all, a fairly large sample of prepared coconut fiber would have to be sent to Europe in order to determine its quality and usefulness. Here I would like to briefly draw attention to the value and great usefulness of large stocks of bamboo, especially in cases where new plantations, numerous new buildings, the construction of bridges, etc. are involved. Someone without tropical experience is hardly able to get an idea of the versatile use of bamboo and its usefulness for all conceivable purposes. It must therefore be the endeavor of every grower to protect and preserve the existing bamboo stocks. Where this excellent material is rare, it is advisable to take care of its propagation; of course, this must be done in a less costly way, perhaps by encouraging the natives to plant bamboo. And in this way, with the help of the natives, other useful plants, whose regular cultivation does not pay off, or only indirectly and after a long time, should also be propagated. One of the most useful plants of this kind is the Areng or Idju palm (Arenga saccharifera), which undoubtedly provides the most excellent roofing material in the tropics. This fiber lasts forever and, apart from roofing, has many uses as cordage. I lived for a long time in a house covered with idju, the roof of which had been in place for 17 years without needing any repairs. If an idju roof has to be replaced after 30 years, you can lose about 25 percent of the material, use the rest a second time and it will last a lifetime. In addition to the Idju, the Areng=palm also provides leaves that can be used for roofing, as well as palm wine, sugar, sago, etc. mn The coloured people are also encouraged to spread their coconut plantations; in general, I believe that with a skilful approach the natives can be brought to undertake many such enterprises; of course, one must take the trouble to guide their work and make it clear to them that they are not working for us, but for themselves; that as a result they do not receive any payment, but that the completed plantations of coconut palms, bamboo, etc. belong to them alone. The indirect benefit for us will not fail to materialize. In this way it may also be possible to increase the livestock breeding of the natives, e.g. to expand their chicken breeding and encourage them to keep ducks, goats and sheep, so that they will later be able to sell the products of their livestock breeding to us. As far as the cattle breeding of the Europeans in New Guinea is concerned, it is high time that it should soon emerge from the small-scale conditions in which it has hitherto operated, and that it should be given as large an extension as possible. For in a short time we shall need larger quantities of cattle for slaughter, as well as for tilling the fields, for moving loads, for riding numerous draught and pack animals. And then the value of fertilizer should not be underestimated, because even in the virgin, inexhaustible soil of the tropics, fertilization may be very appropriate and worthwhile. The help that cattle can give us in tackling new routes is also very important. Even through dense scrubland, the cattle make their way, trampling down grass and undergrowth and making room for better fodder plants; and if the cattle are then followed by sheep, both will combine to create good grazing land on the one hand by destroying the undergrowth, temporarily crushing the soil and then trampling it down, and on the other hand making the soil more suitable for subsequent cultivation. For it is a general experience of tropical planters that wild land which has been heavily grazed for some years is not only far more easily converted into cultivated land, but also that the soil has become more suitable for plant cultivation as a result of grazing.
The method of paying farm laborers in New Guinea needs a thorough change. The present system is costly, it does not train the colored people to work and to be industrious, but rather the opposite, it requires extensive, difficult, usually inadequate supervision at work, and cannot satisfy the workers themselves. All pen work should, as far as possible, be piecework. And with good will, one will rarely find piecework that could not be paid according to performance. Firstly, this makes all work cheaper, more is done, so fewer workers are needed (particularly important for New Guinea), people do not look for a reason to stop work in every slight indisposition or rain shower, and they become more clearly aware of the advantages of the work. In particular, the way in which the workers from the Bismarck Archipelago have been paid up to now is extremely impractical: the people receive almost all their wages only at the end of their service, they then return home richly laden, only to lose their treasures in a very short time to their relatives and especially to the chiefs, and so the worker who has been in the service of the New Guinca Company for two or three years has been able to enjoy the fruits of his labor only a little. It is quite different if he receives the greater part of his wages at once, i.e. monthly or weekly; he then enjoys the advantage of his labor immediately and again and again, he can use his wages for himself, adorn himself, procure all sorts of little pleasures; the comforts to which he gradually becomes accustomed become a need to him, and because he has these needs, and takes pleasant memories of his time of service with him, he will be all the more willing to return to service. A small part of the wage (perhaps a fifth) can be withheld from the worker until the end of his service, so that he is better in control. This monthly and weekly payment requires, of course, that the wages be paid in cash. I see this as a significant step forward. For this payment in goods is after all only a makeshift remedy with undeveloped tribes. By giving the hard workers cash, a lively trade in all kinds of consumer goods and foodstuffs will soon develop between white and colored traders, between workers, colored settlers and the natives, and only then will it be possible to introduce another important innovation, namely, that of letting the workers provide for their own food and subsistence. For if they receive food prepared by us, they become indifferent, indolent and dependent. But if they know that they will go hungry if they do not work, this is a tremendous incentive to activity; moreover, everyone is then free to make their meals richer or simpler as they wish. We would only have to provide the raw materials, salt, rice, hams, dried fish and salted meat. The procurement of ingredients and the preparation is a matter for the people. I am convinced that in this way the food for the people will be much cheaper than before, and on the other hand the worker will actually be able to feed himself better and certainly much more to his taste than before. However, I believe it will be advisable to introduce the halfpenny as the smallest unit of coinage in New Guinea, given the low values of the colored people. For if the long-planned introduction of a smaller unit of coinage for Germany seems necessary, our colored subjects in the colonies will be all the more in need of a low-value, smallest coin. The difficulties in employing the workers, when it is a question of obliging them not to work for a fixed wage but for piecework, will be somewhat greater at first, but they are not insurmountable, as many examples in other colonies prove. Incidentally, I know from my own experience that Malay workers with a fixed daily wage are very happy to switch to piecework once they have learned to see the advantages of it. But not only the colored workers, but also the European employees should, where possible, be paid partly according to their performance; wherever possible, the officials should be interested in their work. In many cases, however, insurmountable difficulties will be encountered. But the heads of stations, expeditions, technical installations, many assistants, etc., could very well be given a greater interest in the prosperity or success of their work, or in the generation of income, by means of some kind of special income in addition to their fixed salary; they could be granted a share of the profits or savings. In return, however, higher demands must be placed on these officials.

Page 122

Here I would like to draw attention to a class of people who can be of considerable use to us in New Guinea, I mean the half-blood Malays of Java (so-called Sinjo). They know the tropics, are excellent at dealing with colored workers, are very practical people, know how to help themselves everywhere, usually write well, calculate with astonishing certainty, and make few demands on life. Depending on their knowledge, they perform quite well as overseers on plantations, as surveyors, draughtsmen, clerks, and in all kinds of positions for moderate pay and are usually very versatile; they can be used for anything and will do anything for money. They also have some disadvantages, they are usually lazy, unreliable and cannot be trusted in money matters, but they are extremely useful if they are carefully checked. And we in New Guinea lack precisely such people with tropical experience, with knowledge of different cultures and all the aids available to the planter in the tropics. I therefore believe that I can highly recommend the employment of Sinjos for New Guinea, but I repeat once again that they must always work under suitable supervision. They all speak Dutch and Malay, but some also speak German or another European language. Unfortunately, only a very small proportion of the officials of the New Guinea Company have had tropical experience to date; although this is not necessary for many employees, in some positions this lack is very unpleasantly felt, and the officials concerned cannot, despite their best efforts, meet all the demands placed on them, precisely because they lack the necessary experience. Incidentally, this lack is not only noticeable in the service, in professional activity, but is an obstacle everywhere. The way of life of the individuals, the way they live together, the meals and their composition, the way in which everyone arranges their home, all this clearly shows their unfamiliarity with tropical life. How different life is in Dutch or English Indians! I am not thinking here of the comforts that the greater development of these colonies naturally brings with it, but of all kinds of little things, all kinds of aids that make life in the tropics more bearable, which are just as readily available to us in New Guinea as in other tropical countries, but which we have not made use of because we did not know them. In establishing our colonies, we have the advantage of being able to benefit from the experience of other colonial peoples if we wish. We do not need to try everything ourselves, but can learn from them, and we can acquire our knowledge with less effort and in a much shorter time. But we must also want to learn and not stubbornly insist on trying everything again ourselves. And it is important not only to familiarize ourselves theoretically from books with the colonial history of other countries, with the attempts, successes and failures, with the institutions and laws and the economic life of the colonies, but also to observe the country and its people, nature and human activity on the spot and to follow the course of development by living example. But those Germans who go to our colonies after such studies will be trained and suited for the tasks awaiting them quite differently from their comrades and co-workers who were sent directly from Germany and who are now expected to work and achieve something under conditions that are remote and incomprehensible to them, without experience and without knowledge of the tropics. The advice cannot therefore be given urgently enough that, as officials who are destined for leading positions, such as for planting, for the construction of new stations, for building bridges and roads, for the labor force, and generally for all practical work, only those people should be employed who have gained the necessary knowledge and experience in other, more developed colonies. They will not only achieve more in their own profession and sphere of activity, but will also be able to exert a favorable influence on the development of the colony in general and on the desirable organization of all conditions. And above all, they will not come to the colonies with exaggerated expectations and false claims; they will therefore not be so easily disappointed and dissatisfied, but on the contrary, through the weight of their experience and their knowledge of conditions in other colonies, they will help to spread correct views among the others and to reduce unjustified claims to a reasonable level. On the other hand, they will also be in a position to strongly advocate the justified wishes of the officials and, as experienced tropical people, they will easily be listened to. After all, every company itself has the greatest interest in ensuring that its officials feel comfortable in the colonies, and it must be prepared to do everything in its power to make life bearable for the officials. However, a company's care for its employees should not extend to the individual, but it will largely be up to the latter themselves to find ways and means to make their lives pleasant. The company only has to accommodate the efforts aimed at this as far as possible. In general, I think it is right to leave it more and more to the civil servants themselves to take care of their homes, their furniture, their meals and all their needs in general. Then everyone will soon learn to help himself; and he will be much more likely to furnish himself comfortably and appropriately for the climate if everything is his own property, if he knows that he is working for himself. And my suggestions will certainly be practicable; in Java, for example, every official on plantations, no matter how far away from the rest of the world he lives, has to look after himself. And how well they are usually furnished, how much better they live than we do on average in New Guinea! With such a life in New Guinea, the costs for the overall maintenance of the individual would not be much higher than they are now. The most important change is that the officials would have significantly larger, airier, cooler, more comfortable apartments. Above all, avoid the expensive, hot, impractical houses that have mostly been built in New Guinea up to now. Give a capable Malay or Chinese carpenter the task of building a house, describe to him how you want it, give him window panes if you want this luxury, the necessary floor boards, as well as nails and necessary iron parts, if possible also the necessary beams, provide him with colored helpers and let him work - and he will build as cheap, cool and practical a house as you may wish. A great grievance and a major obstacle to the rapid development of the colony has been the constant and rapid turnover of the official staff of the New Guinea Company. For the prosperity of New Guinea it is imperative that this constant turnover cease. The civil servants must remain in service for many years so that they become thoroughly acquainted with the country and its peculiarities, and so that the experience they have to gain at the beginning will later benefit the colony. People who go to the colonies for two or three years out of a desire for adventure, or because they want to see the world, cannot suffice in the long run for all the great and difficult tasks that await us in the colonies. For this we need men who are completely devoted to the colonial cause, who are prepared to stay out for 10 or 20 years with interruptions and to devote all their energies to the colonies. This requires, above all, the creation of health stations and the establishment of places that are easy to reach and allow the sick to recover quickly and regain their strength in a short time. The losses (I am not speaking here of lives lost) of the New Guinea Company through death, long illnesses, or the premature return of officers have been so considerable that I believe a health station would be, from the point of view of economy alone, the most advantageous establishment that could be made in New Guinea for the time being. And I am firmly convinced that it will not be difficult for us to reach a suitable point at an altitude of 1000 meters or more and to lay out a comfortable bridle path to it. Just give suitable people a fixed route and the necessary means of assistance, and you will be amazed at the ease and speed with which it can be carried out. This first health station, like the main station, should also be located in Astrolabe Bay, where the high mountains are so close to the coast that suitable points for health stations can be found at an altitude of about a thousand meters, which can be reached in a few hours from the coast. Since our striving for colonial possessions, and the tenacious and determined work and activity to create and actually take possession of our own German colonies, has arisen from a natural need of the German people to seek new opportunities for the successful development of their superfluous forces, and to preserve and utilize them for the Fatherland as far as possible, there must also be numerous people in Germany who are prepared to devote themselves entirely to the colonial cause. From the large number of people who turn to colonial service and want to choose it as their life's profession, we will gradually succeed in recruiting a capable tribe of suitable men who are able to develop our vast colonial possessions more and more and bring them to a prosperous development. In the few years since we have owned our own colonies, we have already learned a great deal, and after the difficult beginning has been overcome, we will succeed in carrying out the work we have begun quickly and happily and in a manner worthy of the German people.

(continued). Due to the direction and navigability of the Neme a good distance into the country, the importance of Love as a trading center is reduced to insignificance. In order to secure the same advantages that the German companies had acquired in Love and along the entire coast from Betikka=ba=Enda to Victoria, we decided to acquire possession of both banks of the river, as far up as the river would be navigable. The day after the purchase of Kumbe, the journey continued to Meme, a Balundu village on the southern bank, which was also purchased. The following morning the journey continued to the village of Bonge on the northern bank, which the village of Knuison and I had passed on our journey in 1885 without having any idea that there was a navigable river in the vicinity. The then "crown prince" had now become the first chief after the death of his father and, as then, had a lot of Calabar people with him. They still had so much influence over him that he refused to sell the village, which refusal was presented in the form of a demand for the unheard-of purchase price of Lstr. 1000 (20,000 M.). Knution therefore left the village immediately and after two hours of rowing arrived at a large village. Ekumdi=da=Liongo (Ekumba Liongo) on the southern banks of the Riveruler. On the way there he encountered several large Calabar canoes loaded with oil barrels and palm kernels. Hoping to get some information about the way to the next village, he called the crew, but since their conscience was probably not clear because of the import of the forbidden Num, the Kanns hurriedly fled. Ekumba Liongo is one of the largest villages in the country and has a significant trade. The derf was bought without difficulty and then early the following morning the return journey was started, which, favored by the fast current, went so quickly that Enda was reached before nightfall, where the guide left Lund. Here, however, he was surprised by a sad sight; the three houses belonging to him had been burnt down and the others abandoned. An old woman they met told them that a large crowd of Calabar men had come there and had brought a large quantity of rum with them; they and the villagers had then become thoroughly drunk on this rum, whereupon the houses had been set on fire, by whom, no one knew, but probably by the merchants in revenge for the fact that the chief had shown the white men the way to Meme. The old man's worry and despair at the loss of his houses and other possessions was so great that it moved even our black crew to pity. The king was taken into the boat and accompanied us to Bibundi, where he stayed for a while, consoling himself with the assurance that the governor would have the Calabar men compensate for his loss if they had caused it. Soon, however, it was claimed that the villagers had set fire to the houses themselves. Under such circumstances, of course, no action could be taken against the calabar men. These people lie more than they tell the truth, so that one never knows what to stick to. In particular, the guide had distinguished himself on the way with stories and lies to such an extent that he was given the name "King Lie" by the boat's crew, alternating with the name "King Rit Bit", which he was given on the very first day because of the mosquito nest over which he ruled. He had at first shown great reluctance to serve as our guide because of his fear of Calabar, but all his misgivings soon gave way to the promise of a good reward and the honor he would gain by leading the first white men up the river to the large and rich villages on its banks. His name would be mentioned in connection with this remarkable event and his fame would reach far away. This was something for an ambitious man like him. His face, framed by a gray woolly hair and beard, was a telling witness that he had been a diligent consumer of the Calabar men's rum for several years. His industrious tongue was constantly at work during the whole voyage, in order to obtain information about one or other of the places he had passed; but how much of all this was true it would be impossible to say. He was very worried that the Calabar people might become aware of his plan. When some Kanns appeared at a bend in the Flussel, he quickly lay down on the bottom of the Vote, shouting "Calabar, Calabar" and stretched out his umbrella over him. The most important result of this trip was the discovery of the mouth of the Memne and the proof that the river is navigable for a distance of 40 kilometers from the mouth. Moreover, as there are several large and rich villages in its vicinity, it is easy to see what immense importance the river must have for the trade of this country. However, in order to take full advantage of our discovery, we considered it necessary to take possession of the other areas along the river. The most important of these were the area at the point where the river ceases to be navigable and Bonge, the latter place being of particular importance due to its location near the great trade route from Love to Bakundu. In order to complete these land purchases, it was necessary to make another trip there, and it was decided that I should do so. A few days after Knuison's return, when I happened to be at Bibundi, four deputations of chiefs and other important men arrived there from the Balundu villages of Liongo, Balunda=ba=Boa, Vonsari and Bungo. It was a stately gathering of men, all dressed in their best costumes, i.e. new, stately hoofed garments and shirts of various colors. Some also had skirts and hats. In their hands they carried long sticks made of a kind of hard, red wood and at their sides tusks in wooden sheaths they had made themselves. Balundu=ba=Boa, the largest of the villages, was also the most numerous and had sent two outstanding chiefs, namely the small, cunning Jombi and the tall, handsome Itasakko. Several of the young men were very well grown, and some had unusually clean, handsome features; the young son of the first chief in Bungo, Mafango, was particularly distinguished in this respect. After the Dolmean Malombi had arrived, I had some of the nobles come into the house - which is considered a great honor by the blacks - to report on their assignments. Jombi, who was the eldest chief, took the floor on behalf of the others and made a speech accompanied by the most animated gestures, in which he reported in the usual roundabout way of the Negroes everything that had happened since Knutson's visit to Balunda-da-Boa, how they had chased away the Calabarvoll and sent some men to fetch us, but how, instead of coming to them, we had driven past and bought some villages up on the Meme. This would have caused the deputation to be sent, with strict orders to do all they could to induce the whites to come and trade with them, and to buy their land, which would protect them against the Calabar people. Either Knukson or I would have to come with them, they declared, "we will not go back before that." "Give us protection against Calabar, buy the whole country; it shall be yours, our houses shall be at your disposal, become our masters and do everything you want." As a sign of submission, he sank on his knees, bowed his head so that his forehead touched the ground, and, as soon as I could prevent it, placed my foot on his neck, amidst loud shouts of applause from the others. After I had promised to visit them as soon as Knutson had returned from Mokundanje, they were dismissed and Malombi was ordered to feed the whole company at our expense. However, this was not more than half successful, as there was half famine in Vomboko at the time. For this reason, the majority of the delegation returned the following day and only about half a dozen of the most distinguished chiefs remained in Bidundi in order, in keeping with their resolution, not to leave until I accompanied them. However, it took a full 10 days before I could travel, and this was a long and particularly difficult wait for them due to the state of half-starvation they were in every day. Finally, on May 27, we set off from Bibundi. Five Krumans and a Batoki man served as porters, besides whom Malombi and Ngalle accompanied me to serve as interpreters and to put their names as witnesses on the purchase contracts that I would conclude with the villages. The Balundu chiefs joined the procession, delighted to finally see their efforts crowned with success. They could now return with honor to their respective villages to introduce the white man there in triumph. The young Mafanjo carried my rifle and kept close to me all the way so that he could be at hand with his weapon if necessary. The route led north along the flat, sandy beach at Sange and Livonge (or Loungi) to the mouth of the Uonges, where a boat had been sent ahead to take us across. After a march of 19 km, we arrived at the village of Betilka=da=Mallale, which means "Betikla with the stones", the name given to the place because of its location opposite some rocks lying far out in the sea. The sea is deep as far as the mouth of the Uonges, but becomes very shallow there and towards the north, so that everywhere, even at a distance of several miles from the land, one can see the poles sticking out to which the fishermen fasten their traps. With these traps, which are unusually large, they catch crabs and a kind of small fish, which are dried over the fire. Apart from some can building, in which they are masters, fishing is the only source of income and employment for the inhabitants of Betikka, who do not farm. In exchange for crabs and fish, they trade hams, koko and plantains from the mountain people, and they receive European barter goods from merchants from Bimbia, Victoria and Calabar, who come there in large canoes to make their purchases. Over a distance of several square miles up to the great rivers Old Calabar and Bonny, the sea retains its shallow depth, and this large area forms a single great fishing ground where enormous quantities of fish are caught every year. The southern, smaller part of this area belongs to the Betikka people, while the northern, larger part belongs to the little-known Fiali people, who live on islands outside the estuaries. Betikka=ha=Mallale is the only Betikka village where a foreigner can sleep; in the other villages this is absolutely impossible due to millions of bloodthirsty mosquitoes. For this reason, I stayed there overnight in order to continue to Balundu=da=Voa the following day. As Bumboku was suffering from food shortages at the time, it was natural that

Page 124

It was therefore only with great difficulty that I managed to procure some planians for myself and my men. The next day we had a long march ahead of us, so we hurriedly cooked some rice we had brought with us and, despite it being high tide time, set off on our march in good time. The flood caused us many difficulties, however, as we had to keep very close to the edge of the forest, where the sand was deep and loose, which made walking very difficult. The main purpose of the map of the Cameroon region is to illustrate the ethnographic conditions of the country. In tepographic terms, it is based primarily on the maps of this area published in "Ymer" in 1885 and 1887. Corrections have been made to these: l. Map of the Cameroon Estuary (1: 100000), published by the Hydrographic Office of the Admiralty, Berlin, 1888, for the coastal stretch between Batoki and the mouth of the Mungo, as well as for the location of the two pots In many places we had to push our way through the thicket, where we were constantly hindered by a kind of cactus plant with long strong thorns. Sometimes the path was completely blocked by such a thicket, and we had to be careful when the receding waves left the bank dry, hurry past the thicket and land on a fallen tree trunk or another raised object Posto des Kamerunberges. 2nd map of the German protectorate of Cameroon by L. von der Becht.

to avoid being swept away by the next incoming wave. The Balundum men were very sad about the difficulties of the path and tried to clear the way for me through the bushes with their long stalks, and Jtasakko even carried me on his shoulders past a lot of places that were difficult to pass and over streams, with the water often rising up to the middle of his body. After much discomfort, we finally reached Betikka=da=Mosongo, the same fever and mosquito nest where Knutson and I reached the coast two years ago after our journey to Vakundu. With the exception of a few newly built houses, it was still the same village with its mangrove forest and its murky, stinking water. From Bibundi onwards, narrow lagoons stretch along the coast, separated from the sea only by a narrow belt of sand, most of which is covered with forest or grass. These lagoons become more numerous further north and merge into creeks that reach far into the land. The countless intersecting channels and the mangrove-covered marshland between them cover several square miles. It is completely impossible to inhabit this creakland, even for the Swords, which is why the small Betikka people have settled on the narrow strip of sand that has been thrown up here by the sea. Here and there, a small stream breaks through this solid work towards the sea, through which it is possible to reach the creeks at high tide. These streams connect the villages with the higher land behind them. At Betikla==haMosongo, the Creckland is still not very wide due to the Uongo Mountains that run out of it. Further north, however, it widens more and more until it finally unites with the delta country of the large rivers. This is a world of its own, a desert, with its impenetrable mangrove forests and its endless canals, on which one can travel for weeks and months from one large river mouth to the other along the coast without seeing a glimmer of the sea. In this way one can travel from Ndame (Rumbi) to Massake and on to Old Calabar, as well as from this river to the great Niger delta and through this to Lagos and even further. We stayed an hour in Betikka=da=Mosongo to let the water sink a little and met the old chief of the next village Betikka=la=Moso, usually called Bamoso. The chief told us that he was not allowed to live in his village for fear of Hellow Duke's men, and that instead of continuing along the shore we should take our way via Likingi, as two large Calabarzanns with 50-60 men had arrived in Pamoso that morning. I explained to him that this was another reason for me to continue on my way, as we could thereby avert violence or, if we were too late, punish the criminals. We set off immediately, and I hurried a little ahead to see that no one from the village could sneak past us and thus report our arrival prematurely. The chief and several of his men joined us, and on the way it slipped out that he did not know whether the Calabar men had already arrived, but he had heard that they would come that day. As little as I still knew the people there, I now realized that the whole story must be untrue, but I pondered in vain about the reason for it. I didn't know at the time that these people, like all the other tribes near Calabar, had no particular reason to invent lies and stories. As the tide left the beach dry, the path became harder and more passable, so that one long bend and protruding point after another was quickly passed, unhindered by the blazing midday sun, which was somewhat softened by the sea breeze. The coast here bends considerably more to the west than the maps of this area indicate; this was also the first time that a white man had made this journey on foot, a thing which, to put it in parenthesis, was very difficult for me, as I had already got a skin chafing on my foot on the previous day, which became considerably worse during the whole of that day's march. The forest, which had hitherto bordered the inner side of the sandbank and shaded the bay, gradually began to disappear and was replaced by low bushes and thick waving grass and semi-grass of various kinds, so that large stretches had the appearance of marshy and partly flooded land. Here and there you could see a pure sheet of water shimmering through the grass. After a while the sandbank ended in a point separated from the land by half a kilometer of water, which the people called Basenge and mistook for a river. It appeared to be one, as the water was half-footed. On the entire 16-kilometer stretch from Betikka=ba=Mosongo, we had only passed a few small streams near the village mentioned, and it could therefore be assumed that most of the waters from this part of the mountain flowed into the lagoon, where their water mixed with the seawater flowing in during the high tide. When we arrived, the tide was at its lowest, so it was not difficult to wade across, where I rode on Jtasakko's broad shoulders. We kept closest to the mouth, where the river was at its widest and filled with sandbars with only a foot of water between them. Two kilometers ahead, Bamoso lay in a wooded hamlet on the fairly wide sandbank. The Balundum men now informed me that one of Pellow Duke's slaves lived in one of the houses and that he had taken the belongings of several Balundum men when they came to the village to buy fish. We also met the man in question, and as he could give no valid reason for his robbery, it was made clear to him that he would have to return the things he had taken, which he did. They consisted of a sack of dried crabs worth about 11 marks, as well as some clothes and a few shirts. The chief of the village promised to take the crabs in a can to the village where the owner lived, the other things were handed over to one of the Balundu people in my entourage. The chief played a miserable role in this palaver. The poor fellow was caught between two fires, so to speak. On the one hand, he had to avoid punishment for the robberies he had committed in his village by making concessions to me and, on the other, he had to avoid making enemies with the Calabar people. This was probably the reason why he was so eager to persuade me to take a different path when we first met. However, it was interesting to observe the skill with which old Scheim was able to pull himself out of the noose. As I fully realized that he had no defence against the Calabar men, because they could take revenge on him and the whole village at any time, I was content with his promise to return the stolen goods to the owner himself and only to hand them over to the Calabar slaves, instead of punishing the latter more severely, as I had initially intended. The latter was also ordered to leave the village that same day and not to be seen there again at the risk of severe punishment. In the evening he also went over to a fishing village on the eastern bank of the Ndame (Rumbi) inhabited by the Fiali people. This village is said to be the only one that the Fiali still have on the mainland, which they used to inhabit in large numbers, but from where they were displaced by the immigrating Banin tribes, Betikka and Balunda, to some large islands outside the Massake and Cdnabar rivers. The nearest of these islands lies at the mouth of the Massake and was named after the governor of Cameroon, von Soden. It lies NNW of Bamolo, which, like the other fishing villages, is small and dirty. It was a large village 30 to 40 years ago when suddenly smallpox, brought there from Calabar, broke out and in a few months transformed this large and powerful community into the miserable remnant of 9 to 10 families that it is now. Although the day was already far advanced, I hired a large can that could accommodate us all, and, favored by the tide, drove quickly up the aforementioned great river Malande, which leads to Liongo. We soon turned left into a smaller side river, which flows in countless bends and bays, or with the main direction to the east. After a journey of about an hour, we reached the landing site of Balundn=da=Boa. The river had a width of 5 meters and was 0.3 meters deep at its lowest water level. The mangrove trees stopped here, but the ground was still swampy; it would have been completely impossible for a white man to settle here. When Kuutson arrived, there were several large barrels of oil belonging to the Calavar people under a shed. These had now disappeared and the shed had been burnt down by the Balundu people. On a partly flooded, long and slippery path, the march to the village was now begun with as much haste as the poor condition of the path allowed. A small stream flowing to the north was passed, and after a march of 8 kilometers we arrived in the village just as dusk was falling. Outside the village we met some men, to whom I heard Jtasakko say triumphantly: "O sänne" (Look now, how it didn't work out, he said). We were given a whole complex of small houses to stay in, surrounded by a courtyard separated from the street by a larger house. A veranda or portico ran around the courtyard, forming a spacious hall on one side. A table and several European steels were set up in this hall. Three palm oil lamps of local manufacture hung from the ceiling and illuminated the whole courtyard. The floor on the veranda was a foot higher than the courtyard, where water collects in rainy weather and is drained from there through a water pipe under the veranda and the houses. As we had only eaten some rice in the morning and had then made a march of 34 km and a canoe ride of about 6 km, we were both hungry and tired, which our hospitable people realized, because even before we had settled down, we were served eggs, ripe pisang figs, plantains, bananas and the like in large quantities. A few hours later we were served a hearty meal of plantans and meat. For all peoples in this part of Africa, with the exception of the mountain peoples, the main food consists of plantans, which are eaten unripe. For my part, I prefer the ripe fruits and always have them prepared when they are available, which is not the case at home. The food was served to me in a bowl with a lid and the water in a dainty jug, and a purple cloth was spread over the table as a tablecloth - all of which showed that here was a people whose education had risen considerably above that of the neighboring Bomboko and Betikka tribes as a result of their contact with the Calabar people. Early the following day I received a goat which, contrary to custom, was not given to me by the chief but by the whole village. When I expressed my astonishment at this and mentioned the difficulty of finding a suitable gift in return, they replied that they had not given the goat to be paid for it; I had come to them at their own request, and they therefore considered it their duty to provide me with food - a highly unusual reasoning for Negroes. During the journey I found that the Balunduvoik and the other tribes around the Meme are very hospitable, as they have learned from the Calabar traders. They are demanding,

Page 126

 to be catered for free by the villages with which they traded. At that time, the village had some 60 houses along the road, and behind them several courtyards, similar to the one described above. Most of the houses were rapped and the chief's house was particularly distinguished by its great ornamentation. White and black figures in the form of circles and shields were painted on the walls, which were painted in an indeterminate shade of yellow-brown. At the northern end of the village stood an idol or ekal house in the middle of the road, similar to those in Bakundu. When I arrived there on a walk through the village, I found the entire male population of the village sitting behind it in the middle of the road and engaged in a conversation, in which Jombi led the discussion, describing with his usual liveliness the journey to Bibundt and everything he had seen there. Among other buildings there (in Bibundi) we have a magazine which is large and high, built entirely of iron plates and painted white, so that it can be seen far out to sea. It is called Ndao ma=Jongo by the people, which means a trading house or house of trade, and its reputation extends far into the Bakunduland. We show Ndao=ma=Jongo's treasures to everyone from far and wide, and it is delightful to hear the expressions of astonishment and admiration they utter at the sight of the great quantity of witnesses, rum, guns, etc. that meet their eyes. The greatest delight is a pramid of several thousand bags of salt. In their opinion, this is proof of immense wealth, and our reputation and influence are correspondingly great. With our 20 nimble crumans, we rule all the villages on the coast and in their neighborhood. (To be continued.) News from the Society. - (Berlin Division.) On April 25, Lieutenant von Behr gave a lecture in the Division on the political and ethnographic conditions in East Africa. Beginning with the Wasaramo, he described the Useguba, the Wagindo near Tanga, the latter of which he described as a very capable population element, and then came to the Arab question. The power of the Kraber has been in inexorable decline since the Jnder took over the trade; their stronghold is still Pangani, which is prosperous and surrounded by many Shambas. Bushiri's fate is not without a certain tragedy; he, a former commander of Said Madjid, was an important man by his standards, as was also shown when he caused the Masiti to revolt after his first defeat instead of fleeing to Arabia. The danger posed by the Masiti had been greatly underestimated, the situation was critical for the cities at the time, whereas Bana Heri's power had been overestimated. The very interesting lecture was followed by a lively discussion, in which the relationship between the rich Indians and the Arabs in particular was examined from various angles. - On the 2nd of March, Lieutenant Sulzer gave a lecture on an expedition to the Kingan which he had taken part in the previous year in order to occupy the Mtoni ferry. In describing the soldiers' equipment, he praised the Sudanese as excellent and willing soldiers. The people have acclimatized well, are quite zealous Mohamedans and therefore hardly drink at all. Their training was excellent; after a short period of training they were at least at the level of first-class reserve soldiers. Sulzer, as leader of a Sudanese company, had to apply only a few very minor punishments in ten months. The Zulus are very different in character; leading a Zulu company is very difficult. Their domestic change of names and their war dances, which they even dance until they are commanded to stand still, are remarkable. Apart from that, the Zulus are a very warlike tribe. The third group to be considered are the Askaris, Suahelis, who are particularly well trained in shooting. Redner described the departure of the expedition, the journey through the hedgerows of Bagamoyo and the crossing of the swamps and the Kingani, whose river users were to be cleared of the enemy, and the attack on a fortified shamba. A fort was then built on the Kingan and Sulzer was fortunate enough to cross the first Kargwane from the interior, the Wanyamwesi, with their herds after a long stay. He also found out about the coins that could be used in East Africa, that Indian and Dutch rupees played a major role. Further inland, Theresienthalers are very common, and in the south the Portuguese issue stamped silver dollars. The introduction of the new coins of the German East African Company would be associated with many difficulties, as the inhabitants are very suspicious and even on the coast prefer to take goods instead of money. - London department. At the meeting held on April 18, Mr. Hermann Meyer was elected first secretary in place of Dr. J. Fick, who had returned to Germany. The newly elected Secretary paid tribute to the work of his predecessor, who had administered the Secretary's office with particular enthusiasm and outstanding efficiency since the establishment of the department and who, despite the difficult circumstances in London, had been able to record significant successes for the department. - Dr. Friedrich Quiucke then gave a lecture on "Gold". The speaker first explained the chemical properties of the element in an interesting way, then explained the various methods of extraction and processing. The speaker then gave statistics on current production, mentioning in particular the hypothesis that Africa should be regarded as the part of the world with the best prospects for further gold extraction. The lecture, which aroused particular interest through a number of experiments and an exhibition of corresponding minerals, met with the most lively applause from the audience. - Bayrenth Department. The department held its general meeting on April 20, at which a report on its activities was given. We learn from it that an averagely well-attended club evening takes place every Thursday, in which the articles of the colonial newspaper, new publications are discussed or lectures are given. During the association's year, Dr. Stein gave lectures on Wißmann's first journey through Africa on malaria and on the exploration of southern Abyssinia by Secht and Chiarini. Furthermore, Mr. Amtsrichter Lunz spoke about Togoland and about the acquisition of the colonies in East Africa, Mr. Wholesaler Bruno Müller about Stanley's Emin=Pascha expedition. Dr. Bruno on the exploration of southern Batangaland. The department is endeavoring to expand its library, which is diligently used by its members, and is stimulating and promoting wherever colonial interest requires it. - In Ruhrort on April 24, Dr. Hindorf, who has become better known to our readers through his works published in the "Kol.=Zig", gave a very well attended lecture on the German possessions in the South Seas, in which he particularly discussed the cultivation conditions there. We are pleased to announce that the foundation of a Ruhrort section is in the near future. Greiz Branch. The general meeting of the department was opened by the director, Dr. Zippel, with an overview of the development and status of our colonial policy and the activities of the Colonial Society, after which Mr. P. Reichard gave a lecture on German East Africa. The board of the department was re-elected with the exception of the secretary, who was replaced by Dr. G. Heuning. Department Frankfurt a. M. On May 1, Lieutenant Maerker gave a lecture on East Africa and the Schutztuppe at a meeting chaired by Oberpostdirektor Heindorf, which was met with general applause. Short notes. - (German East Africa.) On April 29, Major Wißmann left Bagamoyo with all the steamers in order to subdue Kilwa. On the seaward side, as a reconnaissance by the Reichskommissar revealed some time ago, Kilwa is fortified with a strong entrenchment, which, however, is hardly able to offer considerable resistance to the naval guns, so that we can hope that the Aravian slave-trading element will soon be defeated in the same way as it has been in the north. As Fr. Schynse recently wrote to the Köln. Vollszeitung recently, "Wißmann has done a good job here; the country is quiet, the caravan routes are safe, the Arabs have submitted; the severity with which the ringleaders were dealt with did not upset the people, but calmed them down. If they were strict, they were also just, and their firm stance made it clear to the people that they were dealing with the creation of new and lasting conditions." - Small forts, closed on all sides, were erected at all important points in order to permanently assert German rule on the East African coast with as little force as possible. The following aspects were taken into consideration for the construction of the stations: storm-free, facilities for gun and rifle defense with a small garrison, use of existing stone houses as accommodation for the troops. As wooden buildings do not promise to last, the local coral stone is used everywhere. The coast is considered to be permanently secured by these facilities, even if the forts are only manned by a small number of troops. The system will have to prove itself right now, as the Reichskommissar is forced to minimize the manning of the northern stations during his action against the south. According to the Colonial Gazette, however, no one is worried about any danger, as the coast up to Ruficschi is completely calm and the population is subdued. So far, major stations have been completed: Tanga, Pangani, Mkwadja, Saadani, Bagamoyo and Dar=es-Salaam on the coast, as well as Mpuapua in the interior. In addition, there are small intermediate posts and stations at Tanata, Ras Muhesa near Pangani, Lewa, Mioni=Fahre, Mandera, Mrogro, Bueni and the guardhouse at the harbor entrance of Dar=es-Salaam. - The most important news from East Africa is that Emin left Bagamoyo for the interior on the 25th with five German officers, a strong detachment of Nubian soldiers and about 600 porters. We have previously given several hints about the presumed aims of his expedition. May he achieve his goal of promoting and increasing German interests in East Africa! - Premierleutnant Freiherr v. Gravenreuth has been granted a three-month leave of absence from May 1. - Major Liebert arrived back in Berlin on May 2. (Cameroon.) As a result of the advance of Lieutenant Morgen (Expedition Kund) in Batangaland, the advantages for trade associated with this are already making themselves felt, particularly in that it has become possible for the C. Woermann company to advance a line of new factories on the Malimba River into the interior and to conclude contracts with the natives of the hinterland, which guarantee a renewed upswing in West African trade. The Woermann Line, which currently operates 10 large ocean-going steamers on the West African trade, will soon hire a new steamer and has commissioned two new steamers from a Newcastle shipyard, so that 13 large steamers will soon be operating regular services between Hamburg and the African west coast. - Captain Zeuner, who was sent out with Dr. Zintgraff from the Foreign Office to explore Cameroon in late autumn 1887, has died in Cameroon. He was, at the end of December

Page 127

He had then taken the overland route to Kumba, where Dr. Zintgraff, who had chosen a different route to get there, had already arrived. From there, Zintgraff and old Zeuner had set off on reconnaissance journeys northwards into the open grasslands and reached Bakom, but were prevented from proceeding further by hostilities from the natives. After Dr. Zintgraf set off on his journey to Adamana on 17 December, Zeuner had visited the Bafarami Mountains in 1888 and at the beginning of 1889 undertook a journey northwest to Bieko, which was of great importance for clarifying the population and trade conditions in this region. The tireless traveler set off again in April in search of a connection to the Wurifluss in Cameroon via Nyanfosso. Due to malaria, he had to avoid a stay in Germany, but traveled back to Cameroon on the mail steamer that departed from Hamburg on October 31. Since that time, no further details of his activities have been published. African research loses one of its most enthusiastic disciples in him. - The traveler Dr. Zintgraf gave a lecture at the Society for Geography on the 3rd of this month about his journey to Ndamaua, which we have already reported on in more detail in its external manifestations. As far as the nature of the areas he travelled through is concerned, the land rises by about 320 meters from Cameroon to Barombi. Then the grassland begins, which rises further up to the mountain ranges of Bakom. In the Biala valley there are jungles; the grassland itself has no tree growth because of the fires that consume the grass from time to time; only occasionally are there groups of puny trees 20-25 feet tall. The soil consists mostly of crystalline slate, which outcrops like a house; in Baliland the mountains form more rounded knolls, in Adamana more sharply prosiled rock formations; jagged, sugar loaf-like formations up to 200 feet occur there. Laterite can only be seen on the Gaschka-Jola section. Game is not very numerous; the elephant is still to be found in the grasslands, the hippopotamus in the Wuri, the antelope in the grasslands of Adamaua in herds of 40-50 animals, and a small species of buffalo is also encountered. The land around Takum is rich in game; leopard and hväne live there, as well as the lion, which the expedition did not see. There are many monkeys, including the chimpanzee and a large night monkey, and civets have been caught and successfully tamed. Snakes are rare, birds are domesticated, especially parrots, guinea fowl and a large wood pigeon. Numerous fish populate the waters and are caught in nets and traps. Hunting usually takes the form of driven hunts, with whole tribes taking part; the hunting area is surrounded by large nets and then everything that gets into the net is shot down. In Adamana, trapping pits are also set up, the bottom of which is reinforced with poisoned spearheads. Such pits, which are usually close to the path, can easily become dangerous for humans. One day, three porters fell into such a pit, intended for elephants, while trying to secretly escape from the caravan. Fortunately, they escaped unharmed. There are also potholes to which hedgerow paths lead. As far as domestic animals are concerned, there is good livestock in the interior; the coastal Negroes buy their supplies from the bush Negroes. Adamana in particular is famous for its fat humpback oxen, maned sheep and goats. A full-grown, fat humpback ox costs 6 marks in Jola. The chicken, which is usually lean in Africa, is also round and fat in the hinterland of Cameroon; the Bali people are also very good at producing capons. As long as the traveler gets used to the local diet, the food in the interior of Cameroon must be called excellent. The indigenous population also stands out favorably against the inhabitants of the coast, even if not to the same extent as the domestic animals; their physical existence is freer, more independent and more developed than that of the coastal Negroes; one often finds people with an athletic appearance and the people are also aware of their strength. Tattooing with blue dye is common here as well as there; in Barombi, value is placed on elaborate hairstyles for both sexes, while in Adamaua the men enter with a bald skull, but the women wear a towering chignon. The Bali's koysput is reminiscent of that of the Hamburg maids. Great importance is attached to the elongated shape of the skull and the skulls of the newborns are pressed accordingly; this procedure does not seem to have any influence on their mental abilities; on the contrary, the Bali are the smartest Negroes Zintgraff met there apart from the Haussa. Their sense of color, however, is only weakly developed, despite their keen senses. In the rainbow, they distinguish only three colors and believe it is a lie if a rainbow wants to recognize the four; only whites can do that. Redner gave strange examples of the insensitivity and resistance of the rainbow. A man whose stomach was so pierced that his gastric juice oozed out of the wound when he moved, argued with others about the spoils of war; people with a bruised dermis or shot through buttocks took part in the most strenuous marches. In the treatment of the regent, who like a child is the most easily dissatisfied, but also the easiest to satisfy, one must beware of the mistake of wanting to implement firm principles, lavishly is the only right thing to do, since with the suspicious nature of the people one can often get much further by taking a detour. Greedy, envious and mendacious, the black man is nevertheless capable of culture if he is taken correctly, and the profitability of Africa is also not in doubt. (Togogediet.) The German consul Randad died of climate fever in Weydah. According to the "Hamb Korresp.", Mr. Randad had taken a trip to Cameroon on the occasion of the conflict between the Dabomeyers and the French, where he succumbed to Blackwater fever. - (Francis de Winion) has accepted the post of Governor of the British East African Company's possessions and will soon be leaving for Mombas. In English circles, there is a mood in favor of entrusting Stanley with the leadership of the South African Company, which is to penetrate from the south to the north in order to forestall Emin Pasha's expedition. The Belgians hope to win Stanley for the post of Governor-General of the Congo (Sir Perey Anderson). The head of the African Department of the British Foreign Office has arrived here, and negotiations on the regulation of the frontier will now soon begin. (The news that King Mwanga of Uganda) has placed his territory under the protection of the British East African Company has been reported by the Reuters Bureau. If confirmed, it would explain the mysterious hints Mackinnon made at the time. When Emin Pasha entered German service, the Scotsman said that if the Germans came to the Victoria-Ryanza they would see that they had been beaten to it. Strangely enough, the news of this English acquisition coincides with a literary manifestation by the same English circles. In the recently published May issue of the "Nineteenth Century", Sir Francis de Winton published an essay on "England and Germany in East Africa", which vividly advocates joint action by both states in those territories. He varies the phrase "union in strength" in many different ways. A small map, which is enclosed, shows Uganda already included in the English area of influence. While many German maps allocate half of Vickoria=Nvanza to German territory and have the borderline run parallel to the aquator to Muta Nzige, Sir Francis draws the dividing line from the northern end of Lake Tanganpika south of Lake Akenparusee to the southern edge of VictoriaNranza, so that only a third of the lake would remain for the Germans. It is to be hoped that this question will be settled at the negotiations now beginning in Berlin (The British Parliament has also recently discussed the suppression of the slave trade in East Africa). In the debate, the conviction was increasingly expressed that the slave trade and slave legends could not be suppressed by combating the transportation of slaves by sea alone, but that they should be countered in the interior of the African continent. In addition to the construction of stations to monitor the slave caravans, the establishment of railroad connections between the coast and the Great Lakes region was particularly recommended. The wish was expressed that the government should support such undertakings with subsidies or interest guarantees, because the creation of new means of transportation in place of the slaves previously used to carry loads would automatically eliminate the need for the latter. Protectorate of the New Guinea Company). The Imperial Commissariat for the territory of the New Guinea Company is now fully organized. The Reichskommissar Regierungsrat Rose has been joined by the Assessor Schmiele as Chancellor and the office of Secretary has been temporarily transferred to the Referendar a. D. Hildebrandt. - (From Samoa.) According to reports from Samoa, the Samoa Treaty has been signed by King Malietoa in the presence of the consuls and numerous natives. The Tamasese party has reported that it is submitting (Shipping on the Zambezi.) The Harrow Company in England has undertaken the construction of two steel flat-bottomed steamers for the Admiralty, which are to serve as gunboats for shipping on the Zambezi and the Sbire. These boats are of the Sternradtopus type. 90 fni long, 16 feet wide and have a draft of 18 inches to 2 feet. They are shipped in parts and assembled at their destination. The most peculiar feature of the contract with the Harrow Company is that they have undertaken to assemble the boats at the mouth of the river and have them ready for steaming within 24 hours, without entering the shore or any bank of the river. At the same works, side by side with the English boats, six boats are being built for the Porkugese government, which are also destined for service in the same district. These were ordered immediately after Major Serpa Pinto's expedition up the Zambezi with three gunboats. The Portuguese will therefore have a small fleet of nine gunboats on the Zambezi in the not too distant future. From the German Emin Pasha expedition. Kapté in Kamasia, January 16, 1890, Baringo=Nyanza. To the honorable committee of the German Emin Pasha Committee: I have the honour of making the following brief report on the course of the expedition from the son of Jumbe Kimameta, whom I am meeting today. I may note that during the expedition I kept up a detailed report. However, I do not dare to entrust these reports, some of which deal with detailed geographical discoveries, to the present opportunity on the coast, as I would not be able to replace their loss afterwards. I will only ever hand them over to safe mediation. I marched with the German Emin Pasha expedition all the way up the Tana to its source area - through Murdoi, Thakaland, Ukamba, Mumoni, Kitui and Kikuju. The Tana from Hargatzo onwards is bounded in the north by a mountain range, which - compare my report from Hargatzo') - extends into Thakaland. It runs southwest with the river and ends at *) This report was not included in Verlin.

Beginning of the Thaka Mountains proper, about 5 miles above the Kiloluma Falls in a corner peak visible from afar. Diagonally opposite this, on the right bank of the Tanaufer, the Mumoni mountains rise at the same altitude up to 6-7000 feet. I camped in this mountainous region from November 16 to 26, engaged in a futile attempt to build a bridge over the raging Tana. When this had failed twice, I moved along the right bank to Kikuju and marched through Leikipia to Baringo. The Tana from Hargatzo upwards is a series of huge falls and incessant rapids. It rises from 100 to 750 meters in Mumoni and about 1400 meters in Kikuju. The first significant fall is the Kiloluma Falls on the road from Mbe to Mombas. A series of falls and rapids in Mumoni with a magnificent rock section that drops 150 meters vertically to the river bottom. In Europe they would be considered a first-rate scenic sight. The transition from Ukamba Mumoni to Ukamba Kitui is the most magnificent part of the whole river. A series of successive falls, which look like a huge drop, plunges about 100 meters into the depths. 2-3 miles upstream is another very remarkable fall, where the water plunges in a circle about 12 meters deep. Apart from these falls, which must be defined for the cartography of the Tana, hundreds of smaller and smallest ones could be listed. More details can be found in my reports. Two miles above the fall I camped at a place where I think Krapf may have seen the river. On the opposite side you may find the Albert mountain in the heights. It is also placed about 30 miles too far below on the maps. Most of the maps show this area incorrectly. The Tana flows southwest as far as the great falls, southwest, finally almost south, from here it gradually turns west and from the influence of the Dika back to the northwest. Its source area is the Kikuju Plain, between Thomson's Aberdare Nange and Kenya. The actual "D'aana" or D'ögana, however, comes from Kenya. So much briefly about the Tana. More details in my reports. The external course of my expedition was stormy. Fight and war was the watchword! One after the other I had to defeat the Wandorobo in Murdui, Wadsácka, Wakikuju and above all the Maasai in order to get here. I burned Elbeje't and another kraal with the Maasai. I was challenged throughout. The exertions and battles cost me 15 porters and another askari, Alo Agal, who fell next to me in the fierce battle with the Maasai on Sunday, December 22. After this battle at Elbejeto on the Ngare Gobiot, I marched north along the Guaso Nyiro far beyond the Kenya and Eudika Mountains and discovered that the Guaso Nyiro does not flow eastwards between Kenya and Eudika, but continues to flow NNW. Perhaps it runs into the Weiewei. I then marched along the Guaso Narok. On Christmas night we had to withstand an attack by the Maasai. I arrived in Niemps on the Baringo on January 7 of this year with about 400 good sheep. On January 13 we set off from Njemps for the Ryanza. I did not see any English expeditions anywhere. Only the traces of failed Emin Pasha expeditions from time to time. I think I will be in Kabára's Kavirondo in 9 days from here, where, as I hear today, there is supposed to be a white man who has beaten the Wakavirondo. I wish to pass through Uganda, but in Massala I may be forced to turn right through Usoga. I cannot make use of Teleck's suggestion to go through Turkän, particularly because I have no news of Emin, who may already be in Europe, and would not like to run blindly into the arms of the Mahdi with my loyal column. I will find out something at the Victoria Ryanza. Today I still have 48 porters, 10 soldiers, 3 camel men (one of whom is probably hopelessly ill with pleurisy), 2 kitchen boys, 2 private servants, Mr. v. Tiedemann's servant and two porters=uppers. In addition, 2 camels, which I brought over the mountain ridges, gorges and raging rivers with extraordinary effort, 6 donkeys (5 of which were Masai prey) and 315 sheep. Since Odo boro Ruva, I have used four loads of exchange items for guides, gifts, food rc. rc. - four loads of stuff. Bass! So we have not lived expensively. I gave 2 loads of stuff to the people as a reward. One has only to compare the statistics of other expeditions to realize that we were really thrifty. Yet hardly any expedition has ever been as well fed as mine. In general, I would be pleased if the honorable committee were convinced that I have made every effort to carry out the mission I was given. This has repeatedly put all our lives at risk and will probably continue to do so. Leikivia will always remain a very serious memory for Mr. von Tiedemann and me. Mr. von Tiedemann has also been ill with dyssentria. Thank God my health is excellent. I am as well as I was in Europe. I do not yet know whether and where I will meet Emin Pasha, although I am only 75 miles away from Wadelai. In any case, I am not willing, like Dr. Fischer, to turn back in Massala without having achieved anything. Today I am about 175 German miles from the coast and who knows whether I will see the coast again! There is a certain excitement everywhere here. The Arabs coming from Engaboto today tell me that the people there used to be very good but have now become bad, which should interest Count Telecki. I also heard about the fighting in Kawirondo from these people, and I know how bitterly my way here is being fought over. Only today I had to have three Wakamasia shot because one of my men, Chamsini, was murdered yesterday. There is hardly any time to daydream at the sight of magnificent landscapes here. Fighting and conflict are the watchwords here, and it really is time for peace to come to this dark part of the world. I have only been able to contribute to this indirectly! The defeat of the Maasais will be of use to all distant expeditions, and these blacks have also had to realize that caravans are not there to be exploited and plundered by them. They may have learned, darkly, that in this world stealing and lying are not what there should be; but rather that other standards of human behavior are in place. I hope this report is not the last. The fate of my expedition must now be decided soon. God grant that it may turn out in accordance with our wishes, in accordance with the basic civilizing idea of our enterprise and national interests! With unwavering respect, I remain the ever devoted Carl Peters of the honorable committee. We once again draw our readers' attention to the very interesting exhibition of ethnographic objects from our colonies organized by the German Women's Association for Nursing in the Colonies in the Royal War Academy, Dorotheenstraße 58. 59, as it is worth a visit in every respect.

If these contributions have not yet been collected by then, the departments concerned are required to inform the office by July 1 of those department members who have not paid their contributions despite being requested to do so. The Committee is entitled to suspend delivery of the "Kolonial=Zeitung" for these defaulting members until the subscription has been paid. For those members who only joined a section after April 1, July 31 shall take the place of July 1. Furthermore, in Section III, in the second paragraph after the word "free of charge", the following should be added: "with the exception of the case in Section 1, Item 3°. b) a proposal by the Committee to amend Section IV, Item 6 of the Articles of Association to read as follows: "The Divisions and Gauverdände are obliged to obtain the Committee's approval for every public announcement or other measure which may affect the general interests of the Society to be safeguarded by the Board and Committee. In particular, this must be done if departments intend to initiate or promote overseas undertakings from the Association's funds or publicly under the name of the Association. If the committee does not give its approval to such a request within 14 days, the department is entitled, but also obliged before taking further steps, to appeal to the decision of the board. In such a case, a meeting of the Board must be convened within 14 days at the latest. e) a motion by the Committee to add the following to Section IV, paragraph 7: "7.

Prince zu Hohenlohe=Langenburg. The colonial policy negotiations in the Reichstag. After a change had taken place in the person of the Imperial Chancellor and the Reichstag had emerged from the new elections with a substantially changed composition, friends of German colonial policy had to await the first colonial policy debate in the Reichstag with unusual excitement. Majesty the Emperor opened the Reichstag on May ti. May, the area of colonial policy was only touched on in the following words: "The action initiated in East Africa to suppress the slave trade and to protect German interests has, thanks to the self-sacrificing activity of the officers and officials sent there, made progress during the last few months. The complete restoration of peace in those territories can be expected in the near future. The resulting costs will have to be covered by a supplementary appropriation The supplementary budget announced here was immediately submitted to the Reichstag in the amount of 4500,000 marks. The following was noted as justification: "For measures to suppress the slave trade and to protect German interests in East Africa, funds have not yet been approved by the Bundesrat and Reichstag for the budget year 1890/91, as the proposals of the Reichskommissar Major Wißmann had not yet been received in full at the time the Reichstag was assembled and it therefore did not appear possible to introduce a bill to cover the costs incurred. Now that the missing figures have been completed, Major Liedert of the Grand General Staff was sent to East Africa to examine the proposals and monetary claims submitted. On the basis of the detailed reports now available in conjunction with the experience gained to date, the Reichskommissar's requirements for the military and political tasks incumbent upon him in East Africa in the 1890/91 budget year are estimated at 4,500,000 marks, the approval of which is requested by way of the supplementary budget. In assessing this request, it was taken into consideration that, even though the uprising in the northern part of the German sphere of interest in East Africa is to be regarded as having ended, the need has nevertheless arisen to maintain a number of military stations in this area, particularly on the coast, in order to continue the measures taken against the slave trade, to secure the Karawauen roads and to maintain order and peace in general. In addition, the Reichskommissar has the more distant task of suppressing the uprising in the southern part of the German sphere of interest, against which no measures have yet been taken, and of taking the necessary measures to combat the slave trade and the elements that promote it. In order to prepare and carry out these tasks, it has become necessary to increase the number of black men in the Schutztruppe from 1100 to around 1700, which at the same time requires a corresponding increase in the number of German officers and non-commissioned officers. According to the detailed estimates of the Reichskommissar and Major Liebert, 3,088,580 M. are required in current expenditure for the budget year 1890/91, of which the following are accounted for: Maintenance of the European personnel 750,000 M., maintenance of the colored troops 1,358,580 M. 85,000 M., costs for ship operations (4 steamers and 1 launch) including the crew's salaries 385,000 M., various material expenses 510,000 M. In addition to these current expenses totaling 3,088,580 M., there were one-time expenses for the purchase of a steam launch and surf boats, for chartering transport ships, for supplementing war material, house and barracks facilities, etc. for the stations, equipment and travel allowances of 845,000 M. Finally, the need has arisen to set aside a reserve fund of 566,420 M. for unforeseen expenses. The expenditure incurred in the current financial year up to the constitutional provision of the 4,500,000 M, which for the time being is to be calculated outside the budget, would be offset against this credit. Finally, it is noted that the credits of 1,200,000 M. and 1,950,000 M. made available for the budget year 1889/90 by the law of March 27, 1889 and the law of February 1, 1890, respectively, have not only been exhausted, but that an overrun of 365,000 M. to 400,000 M. will probably result by the final closing of the Legation Treasury for 1889. This overrun, which finds its main explanation in the increase in the number of men for military operations in the south of the German sphere of interest already initiated during the months of February and March of this year, will be accounted for in the budget and submitted to the subsequent approval of the legislative bodies by means of the budget overview for 1889 90. The negotiations on this supplementary budget, which were rightly eagerly awaited on all sides, began on May 12 and were introduced by a speech by the State Secretary, Baron v. Marschal, in which the most important things that had happened in East Africa were presented in broad outline: the capture of Buschiri, the pacification of the north, the subjugation of Bana Heri and the dispatch of Emin Pasha's expedition. Emin Pasha's tasks were, in line with our earlier remarks, defined as establishing friendly relations with the natives within the sphere of interest that undoubtedly belonged to us, protecting the interests of the missionaries there and considering the question of where stations could be set up to suppress the slave trade and secure the caravan routes. We are still determined to go hand in hand with England in our colonial policy, especially in East Africa. to go hand in hand with England. As far as the delimitation of our sphere of interest was concerned, it could not be our task to strive for as much territory as possible on the map; rather, serious attention would have to be paid to ensuring that what belonged together in terms of geography, sea and land routes, transport and trade relations, remained together, so that the present territory could be led independently and without danger to a prosperous development. The first speaker from the opposition, Dr. Bamberger, made fundamental statements on behalf of the Free Democratic Party about its position on colonial policy in view of the new situation. The party was not opposed to all colonial policies, but to those that were developing in Germany

had. He tried to prove that the possible results would be colossally disproportionate to the present sacrifices and that the advantages of the colonies would be negligible compared to the fact that we were increasing Germany's line of offense across the ocean to colossal proportions We were facing an East African war whose end we could not foresee. The Reich had entered into this undertaking like a gambler who embarks on daring ventures without thinking. Emin Pasha's involvement was also questionable. The new Imperial Chancellor could certainly not abandon the East African undertakings, although our military honor in Africa was sufficiently preserved, as we had burned and scorched enough. If the government wanted to place the allocation of funds for East Africa in the hands of the East African Society, the party would support it, but it would have to reject the current proposal. Obviously, the meandering epilogue of the pro-German speaker was intended to create the impression in various quarters that the party, although it had to oppose the new Chancellor on the first important matter, stood quite differently to him than to his predecessor. Chancellor v Caprivi denied that his entry into the administration had brought about a change in the views of the government. He had previously regarded the introduction of colonial policy at that time as questionable, and not only for departmental reasons, but he was now convinced that, as things stood today, we could not go back without losing honor or money, and that we could not remain in this position either, so that we had no choice but to move forward. He was not in a position to give a definite program, as this was purely impossible in things that so defy insight into their inner nature, such as the establishment of colonies. He still had a very cold view of the matter today and, with his advice, colonial policy would only go as far as Germany's honor and interests required Mr. v. Caprivi then objected to the conclusion of Mr. Bamberger's remarks that colonial policy as an economic policy was not successful, pointing to the protectorates of Togo and Cameroon and expressing the hope and belief that we would also be able to balance our expenditure and income in East Africa. Particularly effective were the speaker's remarks in which, in contrast to the purely economic standpoint of Mr. Bamberger, he emphasized the ideal moments that have been and must be active in our colonial policy: "Finally, I believe that Mr. Bamberger has not sufficiently appreciated one motive, or at least that he is putting it aside, that is national sentiment. In my opinion - and I did have an insight into some of the things that led to colonial policy at the time - consideration for the preservation of a national current among the people was not decisive. After the war of 1870, a period occurred in which the national spirit, I don't want to say regressed, but seemed to flag. It lacked objects to which it could direct itself. The idealism which the German needs for his existence had become accustomed to being active in intellectual fields. The wars had given it practical goals, and there was still a surplus of it that did not know where to go: colonial policy presented itself, and what warm feelings for national honor and greatness were there were directed, I admit, partly blindly and without consulting the mind, towards this idea. (Very true!) Gentlemen, it is actually also in the nature of the German, who on the one hand tends so strongly towards particularism, that he needs idealism if he is to remain effective. This idealism, if it is to concentrate - and only through concentration will feelings remain warm and strong in the masses in the long run - needs a certain focal point, and such a focal point was given to it in Kelowna politics; it was gratefully received by the nation, as far as I have been able to judge. Mr. Vamberger calls it a romantic sense and ascribes little importance to it. However, I would like to ask myself whether the German Reichstag would be sitting where it is today without this romantic sense, without the instinct of feeling among the people. (Bravo right) I believe the other way around. I recognize a certain power in a supposedly rational instinct, the unconscious in the people's soul, and if I were in my own position I would consider myself obliged to pursue it and try to harness it and direct it in useful ways. (Bravo on the right.) Now the Member of Parliament is quite right in saying that there is not much to be done with this enthusiasm insofar as it is very difficult to translate into sounding coin (laughter), and with the German colonial enthusiasm, of which it is rightly said that it usually stops at the purse. As far as East Africa is concerned, I have the firm belief that if what is now in progress is carried out, if pacification is completed, if orderly conditions are established there, East Africa in particular will be a place that will be more attractive to private capital than one place or another, and I hope that whatever colonial enthusiasm still exists in the nation will overcome the barrier and also find resounding expression in the East African enterprise. For many, the national question was linked to a kind of question of power, and I have to admit that this question of power, which lay in colonial policy, was treated with a great lack of expertise (listen, listen! left), I want to say: in the crowd. For it was believed that if we had colonies and bought an atlas and colored Africa blue, we would have become great people. (Laughter.) Yes, there was no question of that. The beginning of a colonial policy undoubtedly has negative connotations in terms of power relations. People and money are spent in a place where they are not profitable for the time being. If colonial policy is a policy of faith and hope, both financially and in terms of ethical aspects, it is also so in terms of power, and perhaps the demands on people's faith are the strongest here. I believe I am unsuspicious here too. There may come times in Germany when every man in the ranks and every mark in the coffers will be welcome to us, and I can assure Mr. Bamberger that, as far as I am concerned, no man will be deployed in East Africa and no mark will be spent more than to maintain and train what is now there in the paths that have once been mapped out. Mr. v. Caprivi countered the fear of difficulties caused by the colonies in the event of war with the militarily recognized principle that the decision on the main theater of war always determines the secondary theaters of war. The pheasant existence of a small European state had come to an end; the time might come when we would have to be able to develop a certain strength at sea. For a future war, the existence of coal stations was the condition of any naval effectiveness. He concluded with the assurance that the government would proceed step by step and endeavor to bring the companies back to where they originally stood. He believed that the allied governments would be able to conduct colonial policy in such a way that Germany's general policy would not suffer any damage and that the justified upsurge of German rationality would not be violated. After Count Udo Stolberg, a member of parliament, had spoken in favor of the bill, von Vollmar, a member of parliament, defined the Social Democratic Party's principled stand against colonial policy to the effect that more important cultural tasks had to be solved and that every step forward in such a colonial policy meant an unpredictable shift in the balance of power. Mr. von Kardorff defended the bill and expressed the wish that the Deutsch=Ostafrikanische Gesellschaft would one day reimburse the Reich for the money it had spent. Dr. Windthorst, a member of parliament, took a very cautious, but not unfriendly position on the bill, taking his well-known standpoint that the main issue was the abolition of slavery, which could only be achieved by promoting the missions. He agreed with the Chancellor that it was undesirable for missionaries of other nationalities to enter our colonies. But if the Imperial Government made such demands on them, then it should not prevent them from training young Germans as missionaries. The continuation of the debate on May 13 was under a very favorable star from the outset in that it could be announced that on May 10, after effective shelling by "Carola" and "Schwalbe", Lindi, the most important slave trading place after Kilwa, had been taken and occupied by the German Schutztruppe. The Commissioner of the Federal Council, Major Liebert, who has just returned from East Africa, then gave a speech full of lively patriotic sentiment, the stenographic text of which is reproduced elsewhere. Mr. von Bennigsen particularly opposed the view expressed by yesterday's speakers against the bill that the colonies should be abandoned because they might cause foreign entanglements. Recalling the services that German explorers had rendered in opening up the African continent, Mr. Redner said that Europe had a great task to perform in a humanitarian and economic sense. It would truly have been a bad sign for the resurrected Germany if it had not participated in this task. The attacks against the German-East African society had now gradually died down and its treaty with the Sultan would have beneficial consequences in the future. Yesterday the Chancellor had spoken of the fact that a force such as the one Wissmann had now privately recruited would probably not be sustainable in the long run, but that a kind of imperial force would have to take its place. However, he had to say here that of course no part of our German Imperial Army would ever be used for service in Africa, but that this force would always have to be supplemented by recruits. Dr. Barth, who was on

Page 132

Bennigsen's speech, made the incredible remark that this speech reminded him of Jules Ferry's Tongking policy'). He did not demand that the enterprise be broken off, but that the entire colonial work should be put back on the shoulders of the private participants and slowly liquidated. Although he emphasized that the German Empire was obliged to contribute to the elimination of the slave trade and the spread of Christianity, he was very sceptical as to whether the resources expended were in proportion to the goals to be achieved. In East Africa, the Bible could not withstand competition with the Koran, and slavery, which was interwoven with the entire culture, would not end until the traffic conditions there had changed. Prince Radziwill spoke in favour of the bill, Dr. Windthorst defended the blessed work of the missionaries, while von Vollmar once again emphasized the necessity of leaving the work in the colonies to private companies. The supplementary budget was then referred to the Budget Commission for preliminary discussion. If we look at the entire course of the two-day debate, the result can only be described as a pleasing one from the pro-colonial point of view. Only the Social Democrats are principled opponents of any colonial policy, while the Free Finns took a more moderate stand than before, although what they gave with one hand they took away with the other. Most important, however, was Mr. v. Caprivi's speech, in which he showed that he combined prudence and determination to a high degree in dealing with this question. The thought that pleased us most was the statement that the colonial urge is a product of national idealism which is one of the decisive symptoms of the viability of nations. If we were to stay at home because the loss and profit account cannot be balanced immediately when other peoples divide themselves into the world, this would mean nothing other than voluntarily joining the ossifying and finally dying peoples or perhaps, as Mr. v. Bennigsen said, opening the door to other more dangerous and costly tendencies and aspirations. The debate has established once again that the great majority of the people, as embodied in the Reichötage, approve of the government's colonial policy, and that the colonial policy itself rests on a secure, popular foundation. This feeling of security will be very valuable to the government for its further measures, and it will hopefully not fail to exert its influence on capitalist circles. It is not the liquidation of the East African possessions, but the full preservation and development of German world power on the Pacific Ocean that is at stake today, and anyone who would oppose such an endeavor for petty reasons would be committing an outrage against the future of his people. Speech by Major Liebert at the session of the Reichstag on May 13. As the House knows, I returned from East Africa only a few days ago, and I am here to report. Although I was granted the opportunity to spend five weeks in the magnificent Trepenland, I have used my time honestly to keep myself informed as far as possible about everything relating to our military and other situation. Apart from what I was able to see in person, I had contact with the Reichskommissar, with the General Censul, with the officials of the East African Society, with all the officers and officials outside who have been in the area for 3, 4, 5 years or more, and I believe that I have thus gained a certain amount of information. I have endeavored to see things as soberly as possible and have always kept in mind the objections that could be made against colonial policy and its development. I hope that I have thereby formed an objective judgment. Before I go into the factual report that I have to give, I would like to ask for permission to make a solemn and public protest here before the House and the whole of Europe against the unqualified words of the late Dr. Fischer, which are so often used against colonial policy in Africa: "Where there is water in Africa, the land is unhealthy, and where there is no water, it is barren." We have no large rivers in our German East Africa, we lag behind the Congo State with its rich irrigation; but where there is water in East Africa, the land is not at all so unhealthy, but on the other hand, an overwhelming abundance of tropical vegetation is growing JI would also like to point out that our coastline is a distance of over 100 miles, a distance like from Memel to Hamburg, and that *) Tengking has cost the French 334 million francs and 9010 (according to other sources even 36,000) men, the expenses of the German Empire for colonial policy amount to 5½ million marks and the loss of a few Eurepians and blacks, according to the estimate of General von Caprivi. (D. R.)
the distance from the coast to Lake Tanganvika, the border of our hinterland, is over 1000 kilometers. I am addressing all farmers in particular; we cannot say that the soil is fertile or infertile; we have to individualize. If I may very briefly comment on the landscapes that I personally got to know there - these are only the coastal landscapes - I can first of all say that the northern province of Ujambara from Umba to the Pangani River can simply be described as paradise. (Listen! Listen!) I have seen the hinterland of Tanga, also the soil of Tangata, I have seen the rich sugar plantations on the Pangani River and the wonderful Usambara Mountains with their wonderful vegetation and dense population. I became acquainted with the adjoining landscape, namely Useguba, during the two battles with Bana Herl in which I took part. The landscape made a less favorable impression on me; it is dominated by dump palms and acacia trees and one can immediately deduce from this that the soil is dry and new. Cultivation will only have to begin here when the other areas are settled and when it is worth making future wells. Further south follows the Usaramo landscape with Vagamoyo and Dar=es-Salaam as the main towns. The soil there is varied, but I had the pleasure of seeing that an enterprise is being undertaken near Bagamovo which aims to cultivate cotton and which Emin Pasha will spearhead. The soil there is extraordinarily favorable for cotton cultivation. At Dar=es=Salaam, the most splendid soil reaches as far as the coast; the planter only needs to set to work with a spade to obtain the best fruits. Finally, I was only able to see the south, which is occupied by Major Wißmann, from the water during a reconnaissance trip that I made with Major Wißmann towards Kilwa, and there, behind Kilwa, a hilly country with dark vegetation was visible. The officials who were there earlier in Kilwa and Lindi confirm that this is the most fertile part of our possessions. I believe that, after these results, we can consider this objection to have been dismissed once and for all, and this statement would have been quite unacceptable from an explorer, from a scholar, if it had not been explained to me outside that the writer of it, Dr. Fischer, then suffering from liver disease, was disgruntled, angry and, above all, at enmity with Dr. Peters, whose young creation. I will come to the point and, apart from the successes in arms, which are clearly visible to all, I have to specify the deeds of Major Wißmann, our Reichskommissar, in three directions. He has earned great merit by, firstly, creating a model force for us outside, secondly, by making the coast absolutely secure by establishing fixed stations, and thirdly, by ensuring that our troops were in an extraordinarily good state of health by issuing the right orders. Gentlemen, the Reichskommissar has made a masterly move by getting the soldiers in the Sudanese from Egypt. I have seen out there what I cannot describe in any other way - a true model force by African standards. The soldiers represent a warrior caste, a class of soldiers such as we do not know in Europe; they are professional soldiers who knew nothing but the craft of warfare from the age of 16 to 60 and who were used to no other opponents in Sudan than the Mahdists, the Sanatian dervishes, i.e. other opponents such as we find on our East African coasts in the much softer Suabelis and Arabs. I have seen the troops in the stations, in the bivouac, in battle, on the march, and can only be full of praise; they obey the German command, follow the German regulations and conduct the battles, as far as this is possible under the conditions there, according to our war experience. As far as their bravery is concerned, I would just like to cite a piece of what our opponents, the Arabs, say about the German soldiers. I heard captured Arabs say: the German soldiers first make a terrible fire, then they put horns on their heads - by which they mean they plant their side arms - put their heads between their legs like buffaloes, roar like buffaloes and then rush at us, and nobody can withstand this onslaught. (Great hilarity. As far as the discipline of these soldiers is concerned, it is also exemplary. Punishments almost never occur, as the troops do not drink alcohol and excesses and the like are unknown. The discipline in the troops has even been transferred to the population in the most gratifying way. You will be amazed when you see our German stations in East Africa, just as I was amazed when I first set foot on the land. In contrast to the unbelievable conditions in the Arab city of Zanzibar, the dirt and disorder in all directions, you will find the most excellent order on the coast. The new towns that are being rebuilt there - Bagameyo already has 12,000 inhabitants, Tanga 4,000, Dares=Salaam a little more - are built in dead-straight streets according to prescribed building regulations. The house owners have to keep the streets clean. At 6 o'clock, when the sun goes down, the lanterns are lit. That's enough, it's an orderly system, even without the kind of guards we're used to at home. If these troops provide us with absolute security for the conditions outside and make the conditions there all the more secure, then so are the fortified stations that have been built there. So far, 6 stations have been completed in the north: Tanga, Pangani, Mkwadja, Saadani, N gamoyo and Dar=es=Salaam, and the southern stations are currently under construction, as Kilwa will also be developed into a station as soon as it is occupied, and Lindi and Milindani will be added in the south. These stations are set up using the existing buildings: the houses are surrounded by walls 2 meters high. These walls, equipped for gun and rifle defense, provide an absolute tower of defense.

freedom and security, so that it is impregnable by African standards The third thing I would like to emphasize is the excellent state of the troops outside. This is to the particular credit of Major Wissmann, who, from the first moment he entered the country, gave the order that the Europeans were to live only in stone houses and that, where such houses were not available, they were to be built. I have kept the statistics of the troops from the beginning of their appearance, and can give the simple figure: of 218 Euroyaeans who have been sent out in the course of this year, 3 have died of climatic fever. I point out what other nations, English, Dutch, have lost; there whole generations in Jamaica, Batavia, etc. were carried off by the fever in the early days. Now that the coast is actually under German rule and permanently occupied militarily, the interior will be attacked. However, this must not be taken to mean that a policy of conquest is now being pursued. It cannot be of importance to us whether we hold so many square miles more or less; but it is important that we secure the hinterland, naturally as far as possible, in order to bring the important products of the Jnner, the Eifenbein, copal, rubber and what comes from there, to our coastal areas. This is the purpose of the expeditions now being sent out. Their main purpose is to secure the caravan routes and the missionary establishments located in Jnnern. One of these expeditions is the much-discussed expedition of Emin Pasha. When I mention the name, I must defend him in one respect, I would like to say. He was portrayed here yesterday as a military man; I have been on intimate terms with Emin Pasha and I count those hours among the most interesting I have enjoyed outside. If Emin Pasha should read these Reichstag proceedings in the interior of Africa, he will forgive me if I defend him here against the accusation that he is a military man. (Laughter. Emin Pasha is an excellent character, a thoroughly national-minded German; but he is also thoroughly learned, and above all an outstanding scholar, for whom his scientific and geographical research is paramount. For this very reason, because of his many years of activity in the interior of Africa, the Reichskommissar sought to win him over and won him over because in Emin he found a completely peace-minded man to lead the expedition. Under the name and with the skill of Emin we want to pursue peaceful politics in the interior. Through his 15 years of activity in the interior, Emin has gained the fabulous patience to carry out a show with regers; where it is often a matter of trifles, he knows how to negotiate for 1, 2, 3 days, while another Eurovaean's patience breaks down. It is precisely because of these aborted shauris, because of the impatience of the European, that so many difficulties have arisen and so many wars and bloody deeds have been caused in Africa. We hope to have gained a peaceful guide through the interior of Africa in Emin Pasha, and it is in this spirit that I ask you to take his expedition. As far as other conditions in East Africa are concerned, I can only point out that trade and commerce are already reviving in an almost remarkable way. I found a stock of ivory worth 200,000 marks in the customs warehouse at Vagamoyo; at the same time, a Mr. Stokes, a former English missionary who married a chief's daughter and for this reason plays a major role in the interior, reported to Wißmann that he will soon arrive in Saadani with ivory worth 100,000 marks. It has since been reported that he has already arrived there. The ivory yields 15% duty, so it is quite a clean business what is being done with it by passing it through our customs. In addition to these customs revenues and the trade that has now developed after the troubled times, the plantation work is progressing. I have seen the Lewa plantation on the Usambara Mountains, where cheerful work is being done and complete peace has been achieved with the natives. Behind Tanga on the Sigi River, the German planters are working with obvious success. Finally, Bagamovo, which I took the liberty of mentioning earlier as a cotton plantation, should be mentioned. Finally, I have to mention one more cultural factor that I would like to emphasize, and that is the mission. The Protestant mission has not yet been able to secure any successes in German East Africa, as it has only been active for a very short time. It is active in several places, but cannot yet look back on any successes. The Catdolian mission has been active in the country for 25 years, namely the Frèros Algériens, who work in the interior, and the brothers of the Congrégation du Saint-Esprit, who work on the coast. The individual friars are for the most part Germans from the Rhine. Alsace-Lorraine, etc., and have always maintained excellent relations with our German officers and officials during the uprising and now. I have traveled a lot with the missions and the individual brothers, and have received the very best impression of their activities; the missionary institution in Bagamoyo in particular is a model institution. There I saw more than 100 Negro boys and 100 Negro girls who are being taught Ardeit and Christian doctrine. The missionaries have a particularly skillful hand in not elevating the Negro above his cultural mare, but only educating him to work hard under the most modest conditions, in accordance with his way of life and the general benefit. This mission station has also planted an orchard which grows all the tropical products, tobacco, cotton, calao, coffee, banilla, indigo, and gives proof of what can be made of the country if these small experimental plantations are continued on a large scale. Gentlemen, it is not fitting for a soldier to be renowned, and it is a bad point of view to prophesy the future; nevertheless, I am not about to declare here before the House that, firstly, military rule on the coast of East Africa is absolutely secure and well-founded for the long term, and secondly, that one can already express the certain hope that any German capital invested there will work undisturbed and yield abundant interest. (Lively bravo on the right.) The Great South. IV. The Rovuma-Nyassa borderline. By the treaty with Portugal of February 1887, the southern border of the German East African territory is determined by the course of the Rovuma up to its confluence with the Msinje, from where it runs along the latitude to the Nyassa. Thirty years ago, this border area was the subject of general interest in geographical circles, and when Livingstone traveled up the Rovuma in 1861, it was hoped that he would reach the Nyassa. Even when he had to turn back shortly before the confluence of the Rovuma and Lujenda, it was still believed that the Rovuma could be a tributary of the Nyassa because the natives' reports to that effect were believed.1) However, the discovery of the Zambezi=Shire=Nyassa waterway soon caused the Rovuma to be forgotten, and although Livingstone later walked along the Rovuma again on his last journey and reached Mtarika (see the map in No. 8), he reported almost nothing at all about the river and the area through which it flowed. The river had changed completely in the five years that had elapsed since his first voyage, it had become impossible to enter it, and where there used to be three fathoms of water and calm water there was a surf that made any entry into the river impossible. Since then, the route through the Rovuma area from Mikindani has only been used regularly by the missionaries of the University Mission, whose outermost station, Masasi, lies about two hundred kilometers inland. For them, who had their administrative center in Zanzibar, the already difficult, often interrupted waterway Zambezi=Shire=Nyassa was a huge detour, and the hope for a comfortable, direct overland route from Zanzibar to the Nyassa was not given up. Especially after Sir John Kirk's unfavorable report to his government in 1881 about the prospects of the Buxton and Mae Kinnon road, which had been completed to a length of one hundred kilometers, the route between Mtarika and the Nyassa was again considered by the missionaries and walked by the missionary Johnson and the missionary Bishop Smythies. We owe everything we know today about this region to their reports in the Proceedings and the organs of the missionary societies*). According to these sources, the Rovuma rises about a hundred kilometers from the Nyassa, where it originates as a tiny stream at the outlet of a swamp. At one point it approaches the Nyassa for fifty kilometers and flows there a hundred feet wide at a height that is certainly below the level of the Nyassa. The question of whether it has ever been connected with the waters of the Nyassa is still undecided, as the Livingstone Mountains, which appear as an unbroken chain from the lake shore, have not yet been explored by anyone. Rapids and long stretches with almost no current alternate, but the steepest gradient of the river is on the stretch from Mtarika to Makochiro. The river is nowhere navigable, although Johnson remarks that in the rainy season a boat could easily pass all the rapids from the source to Makochiro. The lower course is known to be navigable two hundred kilometers upstream from the mouth, according to Livingstone's opinion for eight months of the year If we now turn to the Nyassa, it should first be noted that it is still completely undecided where the boundary line meets the lake, as no European has yet seen, let alone fixed, the Msinje River, whose confluence with the Rovuma determines the location of the border. However, it is very likely that the Mbampa harbor, the only one on the northeast coast of the lake, belongs to us, but it is not absolutely certain. The route from Mbampa to the northern tip of the lake has only once been traveled by Europeans, but was thus *) See "The Zambesl Expedition" 1862 and Kirk, two expeditions up the River Rovuma. Journal Royal Geogr. Soc. Vol. XXXV 1865, Biue Book 1881. "Unable to compete with the Zambesi route." (Unable to compete with the Zambezi route.)

that it was declared absolutely useless. Only two inhabited points were found along the entire two hundred kilometer route. For long stretches it was necessary to wade through the lake, and in some places, where the shore was very steep, the natives' boats had to be used to make progress. Every year, the proceedings of the Geographical Society report that the university mission will settle on the north-eastern shore of the lake, and it is hoped that this interesting area will be explored geographically, but no matter how often the two Nyassa steamers "Janson" and "Ilala" leave the port of Mbampa, no matter how much effort and money the English sacrificed, no European ever settled even temporarily on the north-east coast, while on the west coast English merchants and missionaries worked undisturbed year in, year out. This difference is explained by the political and ethnological conditions of the countries that form the southern half of our East African protectorate, and it will be all the more important that we become aware of them as we will have to reckon with them immediately after the occupation of the coastal towns of Lindi, Mikindani and Kilwa. According to Livingstone, who traveled through these countries at the beginning of the sixties, a branch of the Zulu people, which had already threatened the Portuguese on the Zambezi years before, reached Lake Nyassa. The Wanyassa, who at that time occupied the entire eastern shore of the lake and had been decimated by Arab slave traders for some time, were easily overwhelmed and almost wiped out by the Zulu bands, and the conquerors flooded the entire country as far as Unyamwesi. There they divided into two armies: one, the Wangoni or Watuta, became cattle raiders and fought the Waniamwesi until Mirambo wiped them out in the seventies; the other, the Maviti, remained more docile and destroyed the Wayao people, the Makua and other smaller tribes through incessant raids and slave hunts. When Livingstone sailed up the Rovuma, he was still shot at and threatened by numerous inhabitants of the shore; *) today one could make the journey without meeting a single person, unless one searches the thicket of islands on which a few meagre remnants of the Wayao can still be found. Gradually the Maviti penetrated eastwards as far as Lindi and sold their slaves to the Arabs there; in 1882 they attacked the English mission station Masasi, murdered and plundered and carried away the blacks of the mission as prisoners, but spared the lives of the Europeans?) The latter learned that the tribe that had plundered them was the Magwangwara and that their most powerful chiefs, Songea and Mhahuli, lived at the source of the Rovuma, where they would negotiate with them about ransoming the prisoners, establishing mission stations, etc. The missionaries Johnson and Porter had the courage to visit Songea from Mbampa, but in vain, the only reply they received was: "Tell me a country where I can still plunder and I will go there with you immediately. The missionaries of the university mission visited the powerful chief three more times, each time with rich gifts, but all they obtained was the assurance that Masasi and Rewala would not be attacked, no promises were made to them about a station to be founded on the Nyassa, and the missionaries were too clever to found a station in Mdampa without further ado, which, as soon as a sufficient number of Wayao or Wanyassa had gathered there, would have become the prey of the Magwangwara. The captain sheriff of the mission steamer describes very vividly how the situation developed in such an uncertain situation. 3) "Mbampa is the most peculiar harbor place I have ever seen. All the people there live scattered on the many rocks lying in the lake, like birds. You see them constantly swimming back and forth, holding their loincloths high above the water in one hand, sometimes towards the mainland, sometimes towards their huts on the islets. They have their crops, maize, batatas and tobacco, on the mainland, as well as their cattle, which are brought onto the rocks every afternoon. Pile dwellings have been erected on other parts of the shore, but these offer little security, as the Magwangwara know how to force these frightened inhabitants to return to the mainland by setting fire to the reeds, which extend for miles in shallow parts of the lake. The ethnological and linguistic conditions of the Maviti are the same everywhere from Rovuma to Rufidji. The Zulu language is only spoken by a few (mostly the chiefs), 1) Siebe "Tbe Zambesi Expedition" first volume Siede "Zentral=Afrika", report by the missionary Maples. 1883. *) See "Zentral-Afnika" 1886.
There are probably no more pure Zulus among the Mahenge and Wahehe, but three years ago Vishop Smythies still had a small but very influential group among the Magwangwara. The women, even those of the chief Songea, were Wayao, and Kiyao was the common vernacular, so that recently in Lindi and Mikindani the Magwangwara are often called Wayao. The part they played there two years ago in the expulsion of the officials of the East African Company is probably still fresh in everyone's memory, 1) just as the Maviti of Mahenge and Uhehe, summoned by Buschin, almost reached the coast and were only just repulsed there by Gravenreuth The terrible consequences which this system of robbery and murder by the Maviti has had for the southern part of our protectorate have recently been described to us by two eyewitnesses. The first was Count Pfeil, who, on his journey to Ulanga, traveled along the northern border of the area that is still called "Unexplored" today. found the remains of the original owners of the land living in the swamps of the Ulanga on pile dwellings, where they were safe from the Wahehe, but seemed to have succumbed to the fever3) The southern border of the unexplored land was seen last summer by Bishop Smythies, when he was on his journey to Nyassa. With an escort of fifteen men, he had great difficulty making his way, as the Maviti had devastated all the villages he knew from previous journeys. For sixteen days of travel, no one was seen, and only unexpected hunting luck saved the travelers from starvation. *) The Nyassa was reached without touching Maviti, but the impressions the Bishop received on this tour were such that he used the ZambesiShire=Route") on the way home and instructed his missionaries not to use the direct route any more. Today, now that we have the news that Wissmann has occupied all the towns on the south coast, the question of how we will deal with the Maviti, if we do not want to limit ourselves to occupying the coast alone, has become a burning one. The attempts of the English to tame these savages with rich gifts have had only moderate success, and it is doubtful whether the lessons*) received from Gravenreuth in Usaramo will suffice. Let us hope that here too the Reichskommissar will succeed in finding the right path to a lasting friendly relationship with the natives! A. W. Schleicher. But traffic routes in East Africa. (Conclusion.) (Cf. the sketch in No. 10 of the Deutsche Kolonial-Zeitung.) The Tanga=Kilima-Adjara railroad line, which has generally been discussed so far, represents a total length of 360 kilometers, approximately 3 of the distance of Lake Victoria Nyanza from the coast. Although one must be careful when drawing up such plans as the present one not to stray into the realm of unfruitful hypotheses, it would also be a mistake to completely disregard other aspects whose realization belongs to the realm of possibility. The continuation of the Kilima Roscharo Railway to the Victoria Nyanza must undoubtedly be counted among these. If we do not want to abandon this idea, it would be necessary for us to secure a corresponding influence on the banks of the Victoria Nyanza and its western hinterland in order to guarantee the profitability of this line at a later date. Let us hope that the courageous founder of our East African colony, Dr. Karl Pelers, who is now in those areas, will also succeed in serving the cause of the fatherland there. The continuation of the line proposed by me would then be appropriate from KleinAruscha at the southern foot of Kilima=Adscharo, in a westerly direction south of the Meruberges, to the northern shore of Lake Manjara (3½ Gr. füdl Br. 36½ gr. east l.), from here along the caravan route to Kawirondo Bay as far as the Ruwana River (2 gr. east l.), then along this river to Spele=Gulf and from there to Kagehi on the south-eastern bank of the Victoria Ryanza. This line would be about the same length as the one from Dar=esSalaam to Tabora, namely 600 kilometers. To return to the Tanga=KilimaNdjaro line, which is to be considered first, it is necessary to give a description of the terrain under consideration. Along the banks of the Sigi and on the eastern edge of the Bondei Mountains as far as the English mission station Magila, we initially find densely wooded fertile lowlands, later insignificant gradients. On the Magila-Lewa road the number and strength of the *) See "Kolonialzeitung" 1888 page 360 Petermanns Mitteilungen 1886 page 360 and 361. Lauk reported to me orally in Kinngani. According to the latest news, the mouth of the Zambezi, which was 18 feet deep a year ago, is now only 7 feet deep and will probably disappear again in the near future, as quickly as it was created. *) See "Kolonialzeitung" 1889 page 333.

There are also many small watercourses and sometimes dense woodland to overcome. In some places, bare rock consisting of gneiss with hornfels or granite with crystalline slate and sandstone comes to light. From Lewa to Sangarawe, the trail first leads through sparse forests over numerous small hills and streams to Niusi, then through a plain covered with 2-3 meters of tall grass. From Sangarawe via Maurui, where the Mkomasi flows into the Ruwu, to the caravan camp of Mombo near the river of the same name, there are mostly tall galleria forests on both banks of the Mkomasi, while the tall grass gives way to a shorter species. The plain retains this latter character as far as Masinde, but the forests become increasingly sparse and finally cease altogether - one enters the sterile, treeless hilly country between the Pare= and Usambara Mountains, the monotony of which is interrupted only by the Mkomasi with its narrow galleria forests until Mikotscheni on the Ruwu. From Mikotscheni to Klein=Aruscha, along the slopes of the Pare Mountains, one first encounters thorny scrub, sparse tall forest, creepers and short grass, then from the Wudeere river to stony, barren ground and further on to a large grassy plain, in which groups of giant euphorbias are scattered here and there. The banks of the Ruwu are partly covered with tamarinds, dense shrubs and dump palms, partly with acacias, which reach a considerable height, especially in the course of the river and on the banks of the small Ronga. The most important work to be carried out during the construction of the railroad would therefore consist of: 1. extensive logging on the Langa=Masinde section; 2. rock blasting when climbing and crossing the Bondel plateau and at Maurui; J. pushing over the 50-metre wide Ruwu and its numerous tributaries, the most important of which are the 15-metre wide Urengere, the 20-metre wide Mkomasi and the 15-metre wide Ronga; 4. major embankments: on the banks of the Sigi; on the Magila=Lewa stretch and west of the latter town; at the confluence of the Urengere with the Ruwu at Maurui; 4-6 kilometers north of Tarabande and at Mombo near Masinde; 5. careful measures to drain the surface water by constructing numerous culverts, side ditches and drainage channels. 1. track gauge. The first principle in the construction of pioneer railroads is to build cheaply. A narrow-gauge line was therefore preferred. When choosing the track gauge, one could vary between 0.75 and 1 meter; however, the former dimension is only suitable for shorter branch lines with gentle curves and gradients, as otherwise the wagons would shudder too much. In the East Indies, where the narrow-gauge railways were originally laid out with 0.60 and 0.70 gauge, bad experiences have been made and all narrow-gauge railways are now gradually being converted to 1 meter gauge. However, the Kilima=Adscharo=Railway discussed here cannot be described as a branch line despite its narrow tracks, nor will it be possible to avoid sharp curves and gradients, so it seemed appropriate to choose the wider 1 meter track. Substructure. In order to provide the track with a firm support and to protect the embankment from being washed out by the sometimes extremely heavy downpours in those regions, an embankment fill of at least 3 meters crown width with 15 centimeters thick gravel bedding and protection of the side embankments against washing away by means of debris barriers is required. Almost all bridges can be built mainly of wood impregnated against ants with carbolineum or another substance. Under certain circumstances, however, especially on the larger bridges, it will be necessary to use masonry abutments with an iron superstructure; however, all iron parts exposed to precipitation must then be particularly well protected against rust. Gradients and curves. In order not to impair the machine performance and travel speed too much, the gradients should generally not exceed 1:40, sometimes only 1:25, while the curves should usually not be less than 100 meters and only very rarely with a radius of 75 meters. 4. superstructure. The material for the wooden cross sleepers can be obtained almost everywhere on site. It would appear to be completely adequate to use only two sides of the sleepers, which are about 2 meters long, 0.15 meters thick and 0.20 to 0.23 meters wide. A somewhat heavy biguol rail made of mild steel weighing 25 kilograms per running meter (11 centimeters height, 5 centimeters head thickness, 10 centimeters flange width, 11 millimeters web thickness) and 5 to 6 meters long is envisaged as the rail material. The rails are fastened to each other and to the sleepers, which are laid 60 centimetres apart, using standard fishplates and screw nails. In order to reduce the mass of the small ironwork, shims are only provided at the joints in curves; on the other hand, it is considered necessary to insert a cross bolt at each end of the sleeper to prevent the sleepers from cracking, which is particularly to be feared in the tropics. The rail joint rests rigidly on a sleeper. 5. operating material. a) Machines. In order to prevent, as far as possible, the machine from being dropped on the numerous curves that are expected, two-axle tender locomotives with a service weight of 20 tons and a power of 40 tons gross weight are proposed. The speed that can be achieved with such machines is 18 to 20 kilometers per hour with a track gauge of 1 meter, while only about 15 kilometers could be achieved with a track gauge of 0.75 meters. With regard to the hauling material, I fully agree with Captain von Hake's suggestion (see Kolonial-Zeitung 1889 No. 34 and 37) to haul wood, but the tender must then be equipped to carry a relatively considerable volume. b) Passenger carriages. The four-axle, so-called saloon carriages with turntable according to the American system, which hold 36 people at a length of 9 meters, seem quite suitable for this purpose. Such carriages were procured in Oldenburg, for example, for the Ocholt-Westerstede line. In order to make the carriage lighter and to adapt it to the tropics, one could use canvas curtains that can be pulled up like blinds instead of wooden walls. In order to achieve greater stability, the height of the carriage floor above the top of the rails is reduced from 1.12 to 0.75-0.80 meters by having the wheels pass through the floor into covered spaces below the benches, similar to horse-drawn carriages. The weight of such a wagon would then be about 5½ tons. c) Goods wagons. Some open or covered wagons, some wooden wagons with a turntable for transporting long timber, and some platform wagons with foldable iron stanchions are intended for freight transport. These wagons could be manufactured with a weight of 3¼ to 3½ tons and a load capacity of 120 quintals. A wagon train could, for example, consist of 1 passenger wagon and 2-3 goods wagons or only 3-4 goods wagons based on the previous assumptions, except for the locomotive. 6. station and special facilities. The station facilities are to be kept as simple as possible in view of the type of construction and the operation to be expected in the initial period. The construction of 5 stations, in Tanga, Lewa, Korogwe, Masinde and Aruscha, and the establishment of 8-10 stops is assumed. The station length is 100 meters. The main track is connected to a blind track by 2 trailing points. The buildings include: the station building with telegraph station and in connection with it a goods shed with loading ramp and crane; furthermore an official's residence, a locomotive shed, a wagon shed and a timber and coal shed, as well as a well-equipped repair workshop in which major repairs can also be carried out. In addition, there are signaling facilities and an electric telegraph connection. Instead of the expensive turntables, special triangular track connections are proposed, as used by the Russians on the Translaspian Railway. The American-style water stations consist of a wooden or iron frame with a tank into which the water is pumped by hand. Keepers' houses are built from 8 to 8 kilometers along the route and are staffed by 1 European and 2 natives, two of whom patrol once a day to the next keepers' house, while the third stays behind. The less important buildings could all be made of wood with double plank walls and wooden or light iron roof construction, while for the station buildings, locomotive and repair workshops, solid framing and iron roof construction, and for the station buildings perhaps also magnesite or xpolite, are suggested as building materials. Houses made of the latter two materials with an iron frame are only slightly more expensive than half-timbered buildings and can be shipped from Europe ready for erection. Such houses made of magnesite slabs have been built, for example, in Walvis Bay, Togo and Bagamojo, if I am correct in my reporting; some houses made of xyolite slabs are also to be erected on the Benus in the near future. The great advantage of these buildings is that the material keeps out moisture, is fireproof and a poor conductor of heat, so that the houses are cool inside, which is of great importance in the tropics. 7. procurement of materials. With the exception of a few stretches west of the Pare Mountains, the timber can be obtained locally, as can the wood for the smaller bridges. In order to obtain the planks more cheaply, which are currently still quite expensive, it would be desirable to install a steam- or water-powered wood-cutting mill near Tanga, which would undoubtedly be very profitable. The impregnation of the wood could be done in the simplest way at the place of use. Masonry material, both building stones and mortar, can be found in the form of coral rock and shell limestone on the coast and in the Usambara and Pare Mountains. Burning the shell or primary limestone would not cause any difficulties. However, due to its low strength, coral rock cannot be considered for the construction of any majestic abutments for bridges; instead, Usambara or Pare rock would have to be used, or where this would not be possible, brickworks would have to be set up. Almost all other materials would have to be obtained from Germany. In order to facilitate the loading and unloading of heavy passenger and goods wagons, it would be desirable to design them so that they could be dismantled as far as possible. Of course, the locomotives would also have to be assembled in Tanga. 8. carriage construction and personnel. The staking out activity begins with the determination of the main direction, followed by the leveling of this route and finally the exact

Page 136

Survey of the terrain on both sides of the railroad line with measuring table, tilt rule and Orientirdoussole. The general local investigations to determine the most favorable main direction would have to be carried out by at least two engineering columns working parallel to each other, since in such difficult terrain as that under consideration here, one column would hardly be able to reach its goal. Each of the two leading engineers would have to be accompanied by two German assistants and a troop of 15-20 Indian coolies or regers, who would have to carry out the necessary deforestation or remove other obstacles. Once the main direction has been determined for a reasonable distance - perhaps 20-30 kilometers - the 1st construction crew begins its work under the direction of engineers. The forests are cleared to a width of about 20 meters and the roughest obstacles are removed. The exact direction of the track is then determined and the section in question is leveled so that the second crew can begin its work on the substructure. The latter produces the subgrade, embankments or cuttings, many of which will require rock blasting. Wherever culverts or bridges are required, work will soon begin on bringing in the materials - drains, clay pipes, masonry, wood or iron materials - and on the construction of the bridges, and iron materials - and the construction of the necessary abutments and piers. 2 kilometers long with tipper and brake wagons; in addition, smaller materials can later be transported on the already stretched track by trolleys. As construction progresses, the locomotive would then of course take its place and bring special material trains to form temporary depots; from these latter, the correspondingly advanced field track would then come into operation again. In addition, a smaller 3rd construction crew would be occupied with the construction of special water drainage trenches in the lateral terrain. Natives are envisaged for the bulk of the earthworkers, who will be reinforced by a tribe of 100-150 Indian coolies. In view of the unreliability and easily aroused dissatisfaction of the Chinese coolies, I felt I should not recommend their recruitment. The bricklayers will also be largely made up of natives and Aulis, although some Eurepian bricklayers do not appear to be dispensable. The 4th construction crew would be the head builders, who would have to be made up of a larger number of Europeans and coolies as laborers. 9. measures for catering and subcontracting. Initially, the personnel will be supplied from a depot in Langa, later from special forward depots in the interior. Provisions are acquired on the coast by purchase and inland by barter. For the latter purpose, it is advantageous to encourage the villages near the railroad line to cultivate more than disber at an early stage, and also to set up a grinding mill for maize, rice, millet, etc. The depots or individual goods wagons are to be equipped with field kitchens to cater for the Europeans; furthermore, a military hospital is to be set up and an ice machine, which is particularly important for the tropics, is to be procured. The engineers will be accommodated partly in comfortably furnished goods wagons and partly in tents carried on the wagons. The workers are accommodated either in neighboring villages or under light temporary roofs, for which the material must be brought to the depots and from there to the place of use in good time. 10. Wages. The workers will be paid in specially minted German money, the form and value of which should be as close as possible to the Indian money in circulation there. Initially, these will be silver coins worth about 2.00, 1.00 and 0.50 marks, then copper coins worth about 3 and 1 pfennig. I understand that the East African company is currently busy minting such coins. In order to facilitate the transition to the acceptance of Danzig money, it might be advisable to pay in goods and money at first. Mr. Schröder and Mr. Koch only paid in money in Lewa shortly before the uprising, namely 1 rupee for 3 days, i.e. 50 pfennigs per tazirka according to the value of silver at the time. According to Schröder's reports, the Negroes had gradually taken a liking to the work and, in particular, to the good wages paid for it and had become quite adept at handling axes, spades and hoes. spade and hoe. The highest wages paid at the stations of the East African Company at that time amounted to 0.62 marks. In Zanzibar in the years 1885-88 a considerably higher wage was paid; there the Negro received 0.80-0.85 marks per day including food. Even if these wages were seemingly low by European standards, it should not be forgotten that the work performance of the regent can only be estimated at one half to two thirds of that of a European worker. Nowadays, when the rupee in East Africa has risen from 1.50 to 2.00 marks, i.e. by about a third of its former value, a native laborer in the interior and on the coast would receive about 0.80 marks in Sanstbar about 1.10 marks. Indian coolies would probably not be available for less than 1.30 marks per day. 11 Construction costs. On the basis of the information given above, I have tried to draw up a cost estimate which takes into account the transportation of materials from Germany. The costs per kilometer are approximately as follows:
Preparatory work, preparation of plans rc. 300 marks. n L. Substructure (without engineering structures) (deforestation of the railroad line to a width of about 20 meters, rock blasting. Earthworks, drainage, culverts, drainage ditches, bridges up to 10 meters span); 3. superstructure )à kilometer 50 tons of Vignol = river steel rails 890 (25 kilograms per running meter) b) à kilometer 10 tons of small ironware (including 1850 reserve) e) wooden, double-sided processed sleepers, 2 meters long. 0.15 thick, 0.20-0.22 wide, including machining per piece 0.65 marks 4. secondary tracks, switches, crossings, replacement for turntables, etc. approx. 5 percent of the main track, 5. stations. Buildings, water stations, other station 30 facilities. Signaling equipment. . * . . . 7. operating equipment (4 locomotives - 136,000 marks, 6 passenger coaches - 30,000 marks, 20 goods wagons with a load capacity of 120 tons each - 52,000 marks) 8. inventory, furniture, tools . . . . 30 9. wages for laying the superstructure . . Together: 24 950 NVarf. Plus: 10. unforeseen expenses, construction management, supervision, administration costs during construction, approx. 10 % 27,445 Marl. In total: This results for 360 kilometers: 360 x 27445 - approx. 9,880 0 marks, . . . . Add to this: I1. 2 kilometers of field track with 8 tipp. and 4 brake wagons, as well as 2 sluice points, plus 2 dralsines 12 00 12. The costs for bridges with partly brick abutments and partly iron superstructure over the Urengere, Mkomasi, Ruwu and Ronga in a total length of approx. 150 meters, per running12000 of the meters 800 marks, total costs thus:. 10 012 G Matf. The running maintenance costs per year would be as follows: 1. track maintenance 200 Marks 2. operating and bathing staff. Salaries (directors, train foremen, freight foremen, telegraphists. Clerks, engine drivers, stokers, conductors. Railroad attendants, workers); I. Heating material (wood) . . . . * * . 4. repairs * . * * * * * * * * 5. other expenses . . . . . . . . 100 . . * nn Together Therefore for 300 kilometers: 300 5c 880 = about 317 000 Marks In addition: 6. interest: 4 % of about 10 000 000 Marks 400 000 7. 2 % amortization 200 000 8. 2 % reserve and renewal fund 200 000 Total costs 117 000 Marks. The maintenance costs therefore amount to approximately 11% of the construction costs. 12. profitability. Unfortunately, I have to rely heavily on hypotheses to answer this important question, as the official figures available to us so far are not sufficient to provide more precise evidence. In this respect, much would be gained if the officials of the East African Company could provide a precise compilation of the exports and imports of our coastal ports for the period from April 1 to September 30 of this year. In the "Ubersichten der Weltwirtschaft" by Dr. von Neumann=Spallart, Zanzibar's exports for the years 1883, 1884 and 1885 are estimated at 16½ million marks each. If we deduct from this the value of the cloves exported from the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba and the other products from the smaller coastal towns at around 5½ million marks, this leaves exports from the main ports: Tanga, Pangani, Bagamovo, Dar=esSalaam, Kiloa=Kiwindje. Lindi and Mikindani, about 11 million marks remain. Now, in the year of the uprising, August 1888 to August 1889, exports from Tanga=Pangani together amounted to about 880000 marks, while the other 5 ports together exported 3000 000 marks. The ratio of exports from Tanga=Pangani to the other 5 ports was therefore approximately 1:3½. If we take this ratio as a basis for our calculation, Tanga=Pangani accounts for about 2.4 million of the 11 million marks mentioned in normal peacetime. It must also be taken into account that, as I mentioned earlier, even if there were a Tanza-Kilima=Adjaro railroad, about three quarters of the value of the products thriving in the lower Pangani valley would still come from the thin water or short lank.

Page 137

transport will be preferred to transportation by the Eisenbabn. If we calculate this figure at a higher value, about one fifth of the total exports from Tanga=Pangani, then after deducting this fraction from the 2.4 million mentioned above, there would still be 1.9 million marks of exports from Tanga=Pangani in normal peacetime. If one assumes that trade during the insurrection experienced an equal decline in all ports, then conversely a revival of the same in the same proportion should also be evaluated, i.e. in comparison to the export of 880,000 marks in the insurrection year 1888,89 more than twice as large in normal years. According to the above-mentioned "Overviews of the World Economy", imports to Zanzibar amounted to a total of 25.5 million marks for each of the years 1883, 1884 and 1885. If imports to the islands of Sanstbar and Pemba and the smaller coastal ports are deducted from this figure at 85 million marks, this leaves 17 million marks for exports from the 7 larger ports. In the period from August 1888 to August 1889, imports to Tanga=Pangani amounted to 350,000, to the five other ports approx. 2 million, resulting in a ratio of 1:6; however, if we assume even the considerably less favorable ratio of 1:8, then in normal times Tanga=Pangani still accounts for 1.90 million of the 17 million mentioned. If we also take into account that a quarter of this sum is also imported directly to Pangani and the lower Pangani valley in the presence of a railroad line, this leaves an import of 1.43 million marks for Tanga. In 1888/89, however, the import to Tanga=Pangani amounted to only 350000 marks, so a fourfold increase in imports is to be expected in normal peacetime. As far as the tariff to be applied is concerned, it goes without saying that the iron donor has to pay the highest transportation costs. After deducting the purchase price and the tax, the Jndier incurs a total of about 0.80 marks in transport costs per pound of ivory from the Kilimanjaro region. If one calculates 40 marks per hundredweight of ivory, and only 15-20 marks per hundredweight of exchange, the Jndian would still have slightly less expenses than this, quite apart from the fact that he would achieve a much greater turnover of his capital per year by using the railroad. With this in mind, I have endeavored to determine corresponding values for the other export and import articles on the basis of the statistical data published so far and taking into account the above calculation, and have arrived at the following results: Transvorte 40000 Mr. 1000 Ctr. Kilima=Rrschoro=Eifenbein à 40 Mk. Copra, sesame. Mtama, Schirekko, maize 135000 beans, peanuts à 1.50 Mk. 8000 800 head of cattle from Usambara à 10 Mk. 3 000 sheep and goats à 2 Mk. 1500 6 000 30 marls of timber and firewood à 2 Mk. 6750 450 Ctr. undyed cotton staples à 15 Mk. 10500 dyed cotton staples à 15 Mk. 6000 60 iron and copper wire à 10 Mk. 7500 500 Molasses and honey at 1.50 Mk. 1200 Mineral fats and oils at 3 Mk. 300 Sugar, spices, butter and edible oils at 2.50 Mk. Grain and mill products at 3 Mk. 6000 2000 Miscellaneous: Kaufschuk, Kopal, Orseille, Ahinozorosbörner, Rindehänie, woolen and daumwollene clothes, silk products, powder, cartridges, lead, Wassen. Sese, porcelain beads, wooden wadding, kafsee, tea. Fish, tinned food, 9000 arzucien rc.. . . 249 700 Mt. together. 240000 round. These transports, all of which are very low, would be carried by the railroad under normal conditions with the current level of traffic. If, on the other hand, a railroad were to connect Kilima=Njaro with the coast, one could probably expect a threefold increase in transports after a few years. The income of the railroad would then amount to around 700,000 ml. per year. In particular, an extraordinarily strong export of cattle, sheep and goats would be created from the Kilima Nrscharo and Pare Mountains. Sheep and goats would also be exported from Kilima Nosharo, as well as timber, maize, beans, millet, pams, potatoes, pananas, sugar cane and figs. pananas, sugar cane, hides, ostrich feathers, butter and game. A further increase in transport up to the full reinforcement of the railroad would guarantee the advancing civilization. This would later include, in particular, large shipments of cotton and tobacco from the plantations, the transportation of timber, bark and whole logs from the snow mills and, finally, the transportation of passengers, which would undoubtedly be quite profitable after a short time, that these communications may be regarded merely as an attempt to contribute to the clarification of views on the extremely important question of railroads and, in particular, railroad construction in our colonies, and thereby also to arouse interest in wider circles for one of the most important tasks of a colonizing nation. But once there is interest and conviction in the necessity of such transportation routes, the procurement of investment capital of 10 million marks can certainly not be considered an impossibility for a country like Germany. In any case, it would be regrettable if we had to resort to foreign capital. First lieutenant à la auito of the II Jngenieur=Jnspektion.
A few things about leisure hours and secondary occupations in our colonies. By Dr. Richard Hindorf. Anyone who knows our colonies from personal experience, who has had the opportunity to observe the life and activities of the Europeans there more closely, or who has experienced it himself, knows how difficult it is for most of them to make really good use of their leisure time. But in very many cases, where time is wasted uselessly or perhaps even used detrimentally, the fault lies mainly in the unfamiliarity with any suitable and expedient vine occupations for free hours, and those concerned would perhaps be able and willing to fill their free time in a very useful way if they had suitable stimulation. And a better use of the free hours outside in our colonies is really necessary; out of sheer boredom and in the absence of anything better, as is well known, more is drunk than is conducive to one's own health and ability to work, and especially so much is talked about and criticized and scolded in the German way against the superiors and the administration and everything that happens in and for the colony, that in the end the whole suffers. I would like to warn those of our countrymen who go out into the colonies not to allow themselves to be drawn over to the side of the discontented by minor trifles, as so often happens. They will not always find everything as they had expected, and experience has shown that our officials in the colonies are then all too easily dissatisfied. In order to counteract this, I would like to draw attention to this mistake and urge my compatriots not only to go out with the firm intention of working faithfully and constantly promoting the interests of the colonies, but also to stick to these good intentions despite all adversities and despite all temptations through willpower and with the help of never-tiring self-education. I am so warmly in favor of this cause because I have seen from numerous examples of such advice not only the damage one does to the colony but even more to oneself by following the rules. Good use of leisure time is now undoubtedly an effective means of getting over all kinds of such temptations more easily, and everyone should therefore be careful how he makes the best use of his free time. For in addition to stimulating socializing, hunting, riding, swimming and other physical exercises, which are highly recommended for recreation and to maintain health and mental freshness, professional activity will leave enough time for many other things. A good collection of books, newspapers and magazines will provide a suitable occupation for many an otherwise lost hour. In this we can take the Dutch as an example; in their colonies, even in far-flung places, they are usually very richly provided with stimulating and enlivening literature; everywhere in Dutch possessions there are reading societies which not only keep numerous Dutch, French, English and especially German periodicals, but also acquire all important novelties in the field of fine literature, as well as other outstanding works, and circulate them among their members. For us out in the German colonies, reading newspapers and especially trade journals from the overseas possessions of other colonial peoples is particularly recommended, as it familiarizes us with the conditions there and informs us about all important events and measures in such colonies. And an in-depth study of foreign colonies must be one of the most important tasks of all those who devote themselves to colonial service with seriousness and zeal; for the best-managed colonies of other peoples must for a long time to come be the place where we go to school to learn about all branches of colonization activity. The more we immerse ourselves in the study of other colonies, the more thoroughly we seek to understand their history and prehistory, their development and their present economic and governmental conditions, the more our eyes will be sharpened for what is needed in our own colonies. All Germans out there in the colonies are therefore strongly recommended to carefully study the immensely rich foreign colonial literature, especially Dutch and English literature, in addition to German literature. After all, anyone who enters the colonial service must take it as an honor to be as well versed as possible in all colonial questions and affairs. But many out there in the colonies will also be occupied with all kinds of research on the spot, with collecting for scientific purposes, or with other studies of various kinds.

Page 138

and such use of free time must also be highly desirable, because it not only gives the person concerned pleasure and relaxation from his professional activity, but he can also become useful to science and the general public and perhaps make a significant contribution to them. However, in order to achieve such success all the more reliably, it is important to choose the right paths from the outset. In my experience, most of our compatriots bring with them to the colonies the desire to set up collections of some kind or to be active in some other way in the service of science. But unfortunately, and anyone who knows the circumstances will admit this, the value of such work is usually not very great and falls far short of what could be achieved. All too often one can observe how, as a result of lack of planning, or because they are suddenly left lying around, hard-working and promising works in and of themselves lose all their value, or that collections put together with great zeal have become almost worthless as a result of incorrect handling and storage. One of the most important rules is to confine one's studies and work to a relatively narrow field, for only in this way can one achieve exhaustive results, and the more valuable successes one achieves will also increase one's own interest and satisfaction. With such a limitation, it will also be easier for the layman to familiarize himself with the subject, he will then not merely become a mechanical collector, but will be able to acquire specialist knowledge, work with greater understanding and perhaps achieve scientific success himself. It is advisable to follow some favorite inclination that you may already have had here at home and to develop it further. Even before you go out into the colonies, you should prepare yourself for such special work; you must obtain the best of the relevant literature, provide yourself with all the necessary aids and, if possible, familiarize yourself with your chosen field here under suitable guidance. And outside, once you have entered a field of work, you should not leave it again until you have really achieved significant success in it. I will try to illustrate what I mean with a brief example. We still know very little about the snakes of New Guinea. If one or two people out there have perhaps collected a few butterflies and beetles, a number of beautiful orchids and perhaps various bird skins - all together probably not of great value to them or to science. - If he had devoted himself from the beginning to the study of snakes, observed them in nature and in captivity, and kept records of them; if, moreover, he had collected all the snakes he could get hold of, and sent the skins, skeletons, eggs, and whole animals in spirit, as well as living animals, to Europe, and had continued this with perseverance for a long time, our knowledge of the snakes of New Guinea would certainly no longer be so incomplete, and the man concerned would have rendered valuable services to science, and would probably himself have derived great satisfaction from his work. This is just one example in one field; but in a similar way, rewarding tasks could also be found in many other directions. I believe that many a person who does not quite know how to use his free time in the colonies would be able to do something good for himself and others if, depending on his inclination, he spent some time working only with the domestic animals of the natives or only with birds of prey, for example, or if he collected only mushrooms or mosses, studied only languages, or otherwise chose a suitable field of work that was not too extensive. I have made this suggestion in the hope that some people who go to the colonies may try to be active in the manner suggested. Our vast overseas territories cannot be explored by specialists alone; the layman can also render important services to science through systematic collections and correct observations out there, and everyone who is capable of doing so should contribute their share to the all-round exploration of our colonies.

Perhaps you will allow me to suggest a matter in the "Deutsche Kolonialzeilung" which, especially for the future, has a certain significance; it is the question: which language should be introduced as the lingua sensu - if this expression is permitted - for Kaiser Wilhelesland and neighboring possessions? In the "Deuische Kolonialzeitung" 1889 p. 75, Dr. Schelleng expresses the view that Pigeon English should be given preference for the time being, "since a uniform language idiom is an indispensable requirement in the interests of the workers". The reasons he gives for this are obvious and weigh heavily; nevertheless, the question seems to me permissible whether, in view of the peculiar circumstances, it would not be desirable to close off the German possessions linguistically from the English-Australian sphere of interest, i.e. to endeavor, as far as human will can contribute to it, to introduce a different language than is spoken in the latter. In addition, as circumstances stand at present, Kaiser Wilhelmsland, etc., are pointed to the traffic with the Dutch Jndia; one will often have to look for workers there, and all this leads us to the lingua franca generally spoken there, the so-called Low Malavian, which certainly carries local colorations, but which do not affect understanding too much. Malapi proper (also known as High Malapi, but wrongly so) is a highly developed language, also spoken by natives, which has the advantage that it can be taught and learned systematically and not, like Pigeon English, by usage alone. Thus, if men who have studied it go out again and again, the language of daily life will be preserved from too great a corruption; incidentally, however, the development of a lingua franca can only be guided within certain limits, otherwise it will naturally emerge from the circumstances themselves. For the individual who goes abroad, however, learning proper Malay is not an absolute requirement; in case of need, he will learn the lingua franca of Indonesia in a very short time. The example of Dutch India shows that the latter, if one seriously wants to, can very soon become a common language in the Denian possessions, where the natives, who speak different languages, generally use it as a lingua franca. A course in the Malay language at the Oriental seminary for those who have time to prepare and learn the real language, a practical language guide for those who can only devote the time of their journey to the study of the lingua franca, would be all that would be necessary for the time being. It is only a suggestion that I would like to make, which is why I refrain from going into the subject matter further Stuttgart, May 7, 1890 E. Meyger. The annual report of the German East African Society for the year 1889, which was presented to the Annual General Meeting on May 19, gives a more favorable picture of the company's status and prospects than the one published in September 1889. Beginning with a historical overview, the development of traffic in the last few months shows that the economic undertakings of the future are starting under favorable conditions. While the total value of imports into the contract territory of the German East African Company amounted to 659,66 rupees in the period from August 18, 1888 to February 28, 1839, it rose to 1,996,221 rupees in the period from August 18, 1889 to February 28, 1890. This enormous increase is due in particular to the import of dyed and undyed cotton fabrics, which rose from 392,683 rupees to 1,356,316 rupees in the same period. Exports did not increase in the same proportion, as they rose from 1,568,863 rupees in the first half of the year to 2,050,552 rupees, with the largest increases coming from ivory and reger grain, while sesame recorded a decline. The contractual relationship with the Sultan, as set out in the agreement of 13th January 1890, takes account of the Sultan's wishes insofar as the average result of the customs revenue of the first three accounting years is to be decisive for the calculation of the annuity to be paid to the Sultan in later periods, as well as providing considerable advantages for the company. In return for his renunciation of his share of the benefits from the customs administration in the years 1890 and 1891, the Sultan gave the company houses in Dar es Salaam valued at 100,000 rupees. The actions of the present Sultan Seyid Ali during his short reign have given no reason to fear that the good relations established with his predecessor will be weakened. In Bagamoyo, the purchase of products and the sale of goods will already begin this year in a factory completed on the market play, while in Dar=es=Salaam, Tanga and Pangani the trade is to begin with the start of 1891. Factories will also be established in the more rural plazas of Mikindani and Lindi. Both places have good ports and it is to be expected that with the increase in production and the increase in business volume on the part of the main line of the subsidized steamship company, the three port places Dar=es=Salaam, Tanga and Lindi will be called at very soon. Account will also have to be taken of the need for one of the ports on the coast to be developed into a naval port and coal depot for the imperial navy. The centralization of the two-steamer line to a port on the mainland is aimed at, where the central and main factories and the headquarters of the general agent are to be relocated. To support the new trading factories, economic agents will be sent to the hinterland of the coast to join the expeditions of the Schutztruppen and bring about an exchange between the producing natives and the factories. Dr. Baumann is already working along these lines in Usambara. Mr. von St. Paul=Zllaire has been given the task of developing the area behind Bagameyo and Dar=es=Salaam, and Mr. Winter has been given the prospect of developing their hinterland after the southern coast has been reclaimed. The cotton plantation Kikoqwe dei Pangani, which was abandoned as a result of the uprising, is to be restarted as soon as the labor situation permits. The actual loss of business

Page 139

in 1889 amounted to 92,686 marks. As before, the loss balance is transferred to the land ownership account, which now stands at 2,404,289 marks as of December 31, 1889. The main accounts show a debit and credit balance of 3,782,367 marks. Announcements from the company. - The Committee held a meeting on May 6 under the chairmanship of Dr. Hammacher, Member of the Reichstag, at which the time and agenda of the Board meeting and Annual General Meeting were discussed and a number of business matters were dealt with. Berlin Division. On the 9th of March, Dr. Kirstein gave a lecture on Chile and the Chileans, in which he made very disparaging remarks about the "model state" of South America. It remains to be seen whether the thesis that Chile, due to its geographical and climatic conditions and the weakness of the central government, must one day break up into several parts is correct, and whether the impossibility of building a railroad from south to north is really such a great obstacle to the development of the country, But if only part of what the speaker has said about the government and the population of the former "model state" of Chile is justified, it cannot be warned seriously enough against emigrating there under the present conditions. On the one hand, the small population increase of ½ million within the last 10 years with a total population of just over 2 million in an area larger than Germany is quite alarming. Even if the mestizos in South America are not multiplying very much, the population increase is much greater in countries with more favorable living conditions. If the character of the Chileans is ascribed all kinds of bad qualities, if they develop all the bad tendencies of the mestizos in a potentiated form, then they no longer differ in any way from the other badly administered states of South America, in which the semi-Indian characterless element predominates. The situation of the country is hardly improving at all, only the wholesale trade is still doing business; the national budget is so skillfully put together with a view to preserving the good reputation of the Chileans abroad, on which they put so much effort, that an intrusion into it is almost impossible. As far as the emigration of Germans to Chile is concerned, it is well known that the colonies of Baldivia and Puerto Montt were founded by Germans after 1848 and have developed well. The Germans do less farming than cattle breeding and industry. In Valdivia the German element is so predominant that the Chileans there even learn German occasionally. In the other towns there are only a few Germans, who provide lively competition for the English and French. But the position of the Germans in the districts where they live sporadically is a very difficult one, so that when they have earned enough money, they gladly turn their backs on the country. In the end, the foreigners only take the place of tolerated people in Chile, since the noble Chileans despise them, even though they have almost no pure Spanish blood left in them. As far as the new colonization of the Germans in the southern part is concerned, the speaker found the conditions very unfavourable on a longer visit there. The conditions of settlement are, superficially speaking, not unfavorable, but the land is exhausted, the yields in wheat cultivation are insignificant, so that it can be assumed that the immigrants would have gotten further if they had stayed in Germany. Moreover, these German colonies of the south were left without schools, and the government had not kept its promises to them, so that the suffering of the settlers there was very great. Since the German colonist is regarded by the Chileans as a Jndian, he is exposed to all kinds of insults and it is extremely difficult for the colonist to obtain justice. to obtain justice. The speaker strongly advised against the immigration of Germans to this mestizo country. We do not yet consider the questions under consideration to be sufficiently clarified to give a final judgment. We expect a description of the situation in Chile in the near future and will then not fail to comment on the question of emigration to Chile. - Cologne Department. On May 12, the Cologne department held a general meeting in the Römer, at which the general meeting of the entire society on June 16 and 17 was discussed and the department board was given directives for the same as well as for the preceding meeting of the entire board. The secretary, Referendar Clemens, then gave a presentation on the determination of the final borders of German East Africa, which was essentially based on a memorandum sent by the Cologne Department to the Reich Chancellor on April 23. The principles expressed therein are similar to those set out by the Reich Chancellor in his Reichstag speech of May 12; the details are less suitable for publication, but the Department makes copies of the memorandum and map available to those members of the Society who are interested. From the speaker's presentation, which dealt in particular with the situation in Uganda and the relationship between the Sultan of Saufidar and Germany, we would like to highlight a piece of information that may be of interest. According to this, Professor Dr. Fabri, who in his book "Fünf Jahre deutscher Kolonialpolitik" (Five Years of German Colonial Policy) first mooted the idea of an annexation of the Sultanate of Zanzibar by Germany and England and justified it in detail, abandoned this plan in view of Wissmann's successes. He rightly believes that the formal possession of the Sultan's coast should fall into our laps in a few years as ripe fruit, and that the suggestion for a kind of retirement of the Sultan should then be brought to us by England. Until then, Germany should endure the inconveniences of the current situation. In a letter dated 23 September 1889, the Executive Committee of the Section for Medical Geography, Climatology and Tropical Hygiene of the (previous year's) 62nd Assembly of German Natural Scientists and Physicians in Heidelberg asked the German Colonial Society to send questionnaires to physicians living in the tropics about the acclimatization of Europeans in the tropical regions there, as they had already been distributed in a similar manner by the German Colonial Society in 1886. Accordingly, at its meeting on October 1, 1889, the committee of the German Colonial Society, after a thorough discussion of the subject, entrusted a committee consisting of the committee member Pros. Dr. mod. et chir. Schüller, Secretary General Dr. Bokemeyer and Dr. Below, formerly a physician in Mexico, with the task of determining a questionnaire that would be particularly useful for colonial purposes. The questionnaire drafted by the commission includes individual sections on the topographical, geological and climatological conditions of the observation site, then reports on the normal physiological processes in healthy people under the influence of the tropical climate (in different seasons, as well as tabular compilations on the incidence and prevalence of the various organ and general diseases and their mortality according to age and sex of the natives, Europeans and other foreigners, and in particular on infectious diseases; These are followed by questions on the course and treatment results of the infectious diseases most prevalent in the area under observation, and finally questions relating to population figures and the ability of Europeans to acclimatize to individual hygienic and sanitary issues of particular practical importance. The questions are basically posed in such a way that answers can be given that are as short and specific as possible, possibly expressed numerically. The questionnaire was first submitted to Professors Virchow. Hirsch and Koch for review and was completed in German, English and French using the corrections and additions that these gentlemen gratefully provided. It was then sent, with the kind support of the Reich authorities, to nearly 2000 doctors living in the tropics and to such persons as could be expected to reply appropriately. The responses received were then to be processed by a commission with the help of doctors and other experts according to a common point of view and the results published by the Colonial Society. Responses have already been received from Grenada, Grevtown. Natal and Java have already been received and it is to be hoped that sufficient material will be collected to serve as a basis for the deliberations at the next naturalists' meeting. Small reports. (East Africa.) The good news from East Africa continues. On May 10, after effective shelling by "Carola" and "Schwalbe", Lindi, the most important slave trading center in the south after Kilwa, was occupied and captured by the German Schutztruppe. - On May 14, Mikindani was occupied by the Reichskommissar without a fight. Small victorious battles had taken place in the area around Lindi against the Arab chiefs, who have since announced their submission. - There is still a report in the "Times" about the conquest of Kilwa, according to which on April 3 the "Carola" and the "Schwalbe" opened fire on Kilwa, which was covered by strong entrenchments towards the sea. During the night a great conflagration broke out in the village, and when Major Wißmann approached from the south on Sunday morning with his 1200 Sudanese to attack, he found Kilwa cleared. The rebels had retreated after looting some of the Indian merchants' stores. The Jndians had been held back by force and had spent a terrible night in the midst of the plating shells, the brewing houses, threatened by the fierce Sanatian garrison. After the departure of the rebels, the Jndians fled the town and hid in the tall grass. 160 of them, mostly women and children, were later taken to Zanzibar by the British warship "Turquoise". The rest remained under German protection in Kilwa, which was fortified by Major Wißmann. - A total of 248 Europeans, including Major Wißmann, have joined the East African force since it was established, 65 of whom have since left, leaving 183; of the 65, 36 have left due to illness, 19 due to contract expiry and other obligations, and 11 have died. Four Europeans died of fever, namely paymaster Merkel, carrier pigeon master Gaßmann and sergeant Schulz at Sanstbar, and finally lieutenant v. Medem at Mywapwa, three died of heat stroke, all in battle or while returning from battle, namely Feldwedel Peter, as well as Unterofsiziere Gombert and Wilzick; Sergeant Ludwig and Unteroffizier Janner died of wounds, Leutnant Theremin of peritonitis and Stadsarzt Dr. Schmelzkopf, drowned while attempting to render assistance. The "Times" reports from Zanzibar on May 9 that according to the latest news from Uganda, the Arabs are approaching from the south to support Kalema, who has driven Mwanga from the capital to an unassailable position on the island of Sesse. The same paper also reports that Modamed Ben Kassim was captured by the Germans in Saadani and would probably be hanged. He is the murderer of the German Giesecke, who was shot near Tabora. - The "German East Africa Line" is now entered in the commercial register. The chairman is the former Reichstag deputy Adolph Woermann. 3 directors are Mr. Ed. Bohlen and Ednard Woermann are elected directors. The

Deutsche Ostafrika=Linie has recently purchased the two latest steamers built by the Afrikanische Dampfschiffs=Aktiengesellschaft and ordered two further steamers of 2600 tons from the Hamburg shipyards of Blohm und Voß and the Reiderstiegswerft, which, according to the decision of the Supervisory Board, will bear the names "Kaiser" and "Kanzler"; the two purchased ships will be named "Bundesrat" and "Reichstag" The voyages will begin with the two completed steamships in the second half of July, initially with eight-weekly expeditions. After completion of the new steamers and the coastal steamers ordered from the Blohm & Voss shipyard, regular voyages will begin, as provided for in the contract with the Reich. It seems to have already been decided that Rotterdam. Lisbon and Naples will be called at regularly on the outward and homeward voyages. The provisional voyages will then continue via Vort Said, Aden, Sanstbar, German East Africa and Mozambique to Delagoa Bay. After the coastal steamers have stopped, the smaller ports of Portuguese East Africa in between will be called at on the first coastline, and the German East African territory from Mombassa to Lamu on the second coastline. - Consul General Michahelles with a large entourage, including Mr. v. St. Paul-Jllaire as representative of the German East African Society and accompanied by 40 Sudanese soldiers of the German protection force, arrived at the court camp of the Sultan of Witu at noon on the first day of Easter. On the afternoon of the same day, the Consul General visited the Sultan and discussed the details of a new treaty to be concluded between Germany and the Witu Sultanate. On the morning of the following day, April 7, this treaty was signed by Sultan Fumo Bakari and Consul General Michadelles. Afterwards, the latter presented the German Emperor with gifts, a magnificent gold watch, a large picture of the Emperor and a number of beautiful rifles. The picture of Emperor Wilheim II now hangs above the Sultan's throne. Under the new treaty, the Sultan of Witu has undertaken to negotiate with foreign powers only through the German Consulate General in Zanzibar or the Berlin Foreign Office. Consul General Michahelles and all his companions were delighted with the good reception they received from the Sultan. - English newspapers were very concerned about the course of the negotiations concerning the demarcation of the inter-travel spheres between England and Germany, as they feared that England would make important concessions to Germany. England would make important concessions to Germany regarding the extension of the demarcation line across the Victoria Panza. Stanley, who, by the way, has recently praised the Germans in order to encourage the English, had claimed that he had concluded important treaties with native chiefs on his march from Albert Nyanza to the coast, and the English press is basing its assertion that Germany does not even have rights as far as Tanganvika on this. Fergusson, however, took the opportunity to declare in the House of Commons that Stanley had not concluded these treaties with the authorization of the imperial government. From this statement by Stanley, however, it is once again irrefutably clear that the English Emin Pasha expedition was primarily pursuing commercial and political purposes. According to English newspaper reports, the English negotiator seems to have made the statement - which is strangely interpreted as a concession - that the demarcation line could be extended to the Congo State on the 1st degree of latitude. Uganda and Unsoro then fell to the British. We refrain from making any comments for the time being until we have authenticated news of the negotiations, which are currently interrupted by Sir Percy Anderson's temporary return to London. - The German Witngesellschaft merged with the Deutsch=Ostafrikanische Gesellschaft at the general meeting on May 19. - (Togo area.) A new society for the colonization of the German Togo area is in the process of being formed. The initiative was taken by the traveler Dr. mod. W. Wolff, who was a member of the last expedition to West Africa sent out by the African Society. A company with a nominal capital of one million marks is to be formed, of which, however, only 40 percent or 400,000 marks are to be paid in initially. Further payments would only be made when the facilities were enlarged. According to Dr. Wolff's detailed explanations, maize, rice, peanuts, cotton, oil palms, coconut palms and cocoa are to be planted and built there. - The Imperial Commissioner von Puttkamer has issued a decree concerning the trade in palm kernels. Trade in palm kernels containing more than 10 percent shells is prohibited. - Mr. Goldberg, the former administrator of the German Trading and Plantation Company of the South Seas, has gone to the Togo region to carry out experiments there with cotton cultivation. Premier Lieutenant Kling has arrived in Berlin. - (Cameroon.) On February 1, 1890, the Imperial Gonverneur i. V. issued a decree concerning the establishment of a cemetery in Cameroon. - Baron von Soden, the Governor of Cameroon, has arrived in Berlin. It is said that he will not go back to Africa because of his failing health (Schupgebiet der Neu=Guinea=Kompanie.) In place of the deceased Mr. Arnold, the merchant Eduard Wißmann of Soerabaya has been appointed Director General for the protectorate. He had been active in Dutch Guinea for 13 years and administered the German consulate there for six years on a deputy basis. - The Mission of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in Salzburg has sent four missionaries to the Wlawollo station in New Pomerania. They left for Finschhafen on April 25. (Schupgediet der Marschallinseln.) The Imperial Commissioner Vice-Consul Biermann issued a decree on January 30 concerning the concessioning of show posts. Other ordinances published in the Colonial Gazette concern foreigners without means of subsistence and contracts with natives for objects of higher value. (Deutsch=Ostafrikanische Gesellschaft.) We announced in No. 10 of the Kolonialzeitung that a general meeting of the company convened for June 4 would have to discuss the issue of preferential shares. This intended measure does not appear to have met with the approval of all holders of shares, as can be seen from a submission published in the advertising section. On the treatment of dysentery (dysentery). A well-known doctor belonging to our society has sent the following communication to the editors with a request for inclusion: "The fact that repeated cases of dysentery have occurred in our tropical colonies, forcing some of the Germans there to return home as quickly as possible, prompts me to recommend to doctors and patients in the tropics for review a method of treatment that has not yet been published, which I used years ago during a small dysentery epidemic and have continued to use occasionally with excellent success. The treatment of dysentery in fresh cases should be initiated with a fast-acting laxative in order to free the intestines of any remaining fecal masses which, if left lying around, only increase the disease process in the intestines. If vomiting prevents the use of a laxative, the large intestine can be cleansed by carefully flushing out the bowel from the anus (preferably using a juggler or funnel with a long tube through which up to 1 liter of boiled lukewarm water - possibly with the addition of 50 grams of 1 to 2 percent salicylic acid = boric acid). Salicylic acid=Borax solution - into the bowel of the patient lying in a horizontal position). The patient then takes a knife point full or ½ teaspoonful of iron powder once or twice an hour, preferably the Porrum hydrogonio roduetum either in wafers or mixed with a little boiled water to form a paste. When the stools turn black (so colored by the undigested iron), they usually also become less voluminous. The bleeding decreases; finally the bloody admixtures stop completely. Then the iron powder can be taken a little less frequently, but the doses must be immediately increased again as soon as bloody discharges occur again. According to my observations, the dysentery process seemed to be considerably shortened as a result, which was also supported by the microscopic examinations of the stools that I carried out on an ongoing basis. Of course, the dietary behavior of the patient must be adapted accordingly to the disease, which will not be discussed further here. Iron powder, especially the Perrum bydrogenio reductum, can easily be carried in a well-sealed glass jar. 2 % salicyl = borax solution is prepared by dissolving 2 grams of borax in 100 grams of hot water and then adding 2 grams of salicylic acid. This can also be used for occasional careful bowel irrigation during the course of the disease. (A Somali caravan) has arrived here under the leadership of Mr. Menges and is giving its performances in the New Arena at Bellevne station. We draw our readers' attention to this interesting show, as the men are splendid types with well-formed facial features and beautiful physiques, skilled in the handling of javelins and practiced in the close combat that travelers have so often described. The troop has brought nimble riding camels, horses and ostriches and the picture that unfolds on the camp site is a very attractive one. Literature. The German Emin Pasha expedition. By Rust, Captain=Lieutenant D. With 1 map. Berlin. Published by Friedrich Luckbardt. The title is misleading if one expects a complete history of the Emin Pasha expedition, which, as is well known, has not yet been completed. The book comprises only the personal experiences of Mr. Rust, which do not extend beyond November and were reported in the expedition reports of his time published in the "Kolonialzeitung". The description of the character of the Somali and the landscape along the banks of the Tana is quite nice. Atlas de Géographie Modorne, édité par F. Schrader, F. Prudent et G. Anthoine. Librairie Hachette et Cio, Paris 1890. 12° livraison. This atlas is a meticulously produced map series. The atlas contains a total of 64 colored maps, which appear in deliveries of 3 maps each. The current 12th delivery contains "France" in 4 maps. The text on the back of the maps contains numerous special maps in black print and a great wealth of geographical, physical, political and statistical material, so that the price of 16 marks for the complete atlas appears to be a very moderate one. Canalization. Gerlin Department. During the summer months the lectures are canceled, but, as in the past, visitors meet informally every Friday evening either on the terrace or in the department room (Architektenhaus, Wilhelmstraße), weather permitting. Guests are always welcome. The board of directors. Speaking hours of the Redallion from 11-1 Ahr.

Announcement. In view of the imminent return of Major Wißmann, the Cologne Division has requested that the Annual General Meeting scheduled for June 16 and 17 be postponed to a later date. This request has been granted by the President and the Annual General Meeting will take place on June 30 and July 1. The members are invited to attend, noting that there will be no change to the agenda already announced. German Colonial Society. Germany's pioneers in East Africa. After the exciting events of the last few weeks, there has been a pause in the development of East African affairs, which, however, invites us all the more to look back and look ahead, as new important events are preparing to take place during the period of relative calm. Major Wißmann has brilliantly accomplished the task he set himself, the north has finally been subdued and the expansion of the forts completed, the administration organized and the Schutztruppe so well developed in military terms that it would be able to stand up to the strict eyes of an officer even in Germany; the rebellious cities of the south have been conquered, the rebels driven out and the forts are being built to prevent the wild tribes of the hinterland from harassing the cities and the Arab slave traders from opening up their ancient routes here again. Wißmann returned as a glorious victor, decorated and probably showered with honors, after he had devoted himself to his great task of suppressing the slave trade and protecting German interests for over a year under the most grueling conditions. We German colonial friends in particular must be grateful to him, because most of it depended on his personal activity. We do not yet have a sufficient number of militarily and scientifically educated Africans at our disposal to be able to satisfy any need that may arise for our colonists. It has been said several times by people who have closely observed Wissmann's activities in Africa that no one else would have been able to carry out the work he had begun in this way. One only has to realize what enormous damage could have been done not only to the German colonial movement, but perhaps to the overall policy of the German fatherland, if Wißmann and his officers had not had the success that was expected of them. The internal opponents of German colonial policy would have taken advantage of any failure, while they are now more and more willing not to deny recognition to the courageous champions of Germany's honor. If the expedition had failed, foreign countries would certainly have approached it with certain demands, whereas now they have to accept the idea, for better or worse, that German prowess is not only capable of winning major European wars, but also an African expedition that is extremely difficult in some respects. But if Wißmann has proved himself worthy of the trust placed in him, Dr. Peters has also achieved significant things and, as leader of the German Emin Pasha expedition, has increased the fame that is due to him as the founder of the East African colony. As is well known, this expedition had to contend with the most difficult obstacles from the outset. It not only met with lively opposition in official German circles, but was fought by the English in East Africa in such a way that the indignation in German national circles became general. After a successful landing in Witu, the expedition was held up by a lack of porters, had to split up into several parts, which were prevented from joining up by various misfortunes, and could only penetrate into the completely unknown interior beyond Massa with infinite difficulty. As the illness of Mr. Borchert, who has now returned home in a seriously ill state, made it impossible to inform the bold, forward-moving leader of Emin Pasha's return, the expedition was without any contact with the coast for many months. There was a lack of suitable articles of exchange for the Masai country, and there was general concern that the passage could only be accomplished with the greatest difficulty. At last the good news arrived that Dr. Peters was at Lake Baringo, and soon afterwards the German Emin Pasha Committee was informed of a letter from the leader of the expedition which had arrived in Sanstbar and was written in Rubaga, the capital of Uganda, in which Dr. Peters informed them that he was starting his return journey to Bagamoyo via Usukuma and Ugogo. Rubaga is the residence of King Mtesa, who died in 1884, and was already visited several times in the 1970s. Stanley gives a very vivid description of the place in his book "Through the Dark Part of the World". He had sailed across the lake, was welcomed there by a Ugandan fleet and led to the port of Usawara, where he was met by Miesa. They then moved to the Rubaga residence, which, contrary to other African customs, was situated on a mountain peak and was accessible from all sides by unusually wide and beautiful roads. However, Rubaga lost its character as the main city during Mtesa's lifetime, as the king preferred to stay at another nearby palace, Rabulagala, in the last years of his life. His successor, King Mwanga, also built his residence on the Rabulagala hill, but later settled close to it in a place called

Page 142

with the name Mengo'). All these places, where the political life of Uganda is centralized, are not far from each other, close to a bay of the Nyanza, which makes a comfortable landing possible. To our knowledge, apart from Dr. Peters, only Jackson's caravan has so far succeeded in reaching the Kingdom of Uganda from the east through Usoga, as the legend was very widespread among the population that the men who came from the northeast would "eat" the country, i.e. gain control. Bishop Hannington, who wanted to penetrate through Kavirondo to Rubaga, seems to have fallen victim to this superstition; for there is hardly any other reason for his murder, which was carried out with the knowledge of King Mwanga, as the king spared the other English and French missionaries living in his country Here in Rubaga, which Emin Pasha also visited. and which maintained more or less close relations with Wadelai, Peters probably first received the certain news of Emin Pasha's return to the coast and had to decide with a heavy heart to return. He and his companion, Lieutenant v. Tiedemann, set off on this return journey and, according to the latest news from Zanzibar, arrived in Ukumi (Usukuma) on April 13th, as the only route that could be considered for the return journey was the most comfortable and easiest to pass via the Victoria=Nyanza. On the way from Ukumi to the coast, Dr. Peters will no doubt meet or have already met Emin Pasha. Dr. Peters also carried out his task with unusual energy and perseverance and would certainly have reached his destination of Wadelai in Uganda, had it still been necessary. For us, however, who have so often stood up for the much attacked German Emin Pasha expedition and its leader, it is a great satisfaction that, even if the actual purpose of supporting Emin was unsuccessful due to a peculiar chain of circumstances, the expedition as such achieved outstanding things and did honour to the German name in every respect. It is also known that Stauley and Emin Pasha marched through Usukuma to the coast at the time. Father Schynse has given a very vivid and lively description of this route in a very clearly and freshly written booklet, *) which is of particular interest in that the aforementioned man is now known to be accompanying Emin Pasha on his journey into the interior. Father Schynse's descriptions, which are unpretentious and simple and therefore all the more give the impression of simple truthfulness, cover an area that is already largely known, but Stanley, who was otherwise not sparing with his reports, did not consider it necessary to publish anything about the part of his return journey that falls within the German protectorate, so that this description fills a gap that is felt quite strongly. *) The various contributions to the characterization of Emin Paschad are particularly gracefully narrated. He praises his unflagging diligence, his philanthropy and care for the welfare of others, which made him renounce even long-cherished pleasures in order to give them to those in need, and his tireless perseverance. From all these small traits one gains a complete picture of Emin's deep inner disposition, which, however, could not harmonize with Stanley's nature. The conclusion of the new protection contract with Witu. On the visit paid by the Consul General Dr. Michahelles for the conclusion of the protection and trade treaty at the beginning *) Siebe Two Kings of Uganda: or Life by the sbores of Victoria-Nyansa. By Robert P. Ashe. *) With Stanley and Emin Pasha through German East Africa. Travel diary by P. Aug. Schonse. Edited by Karl Hespers. Cologne with J. P. Bachem. The Freisinnige Zeitung says in a review of the book: "Father Schonse is of course very enthusiastic about Wißmann's military expedition. But if you want to get an idea of the inhospitality and worthlessness of the German firing range, especially in the inner parts of it, you may get an idea from Father Schynse's descriptions of the desolate landscapes, the lack of water, the impassability, and so on." Such a criticism has about the same weight as if one wanted to measure the economic value of Germany by the Lüneburger Haide. Anyone who has only superficially studied the geography of German East Africa knows that the land of Mowapwa is not worth much after the Vickoria Nyanza, but what does such a part mean in relation to the whole! The area to the east of Mowaywa, especially the Usagara landscape, is also described by Father Schonie as healthily fertile, as a wild paradise.
A member of the expedition wrote to us about the visit he made to the Sultan of Witu on April 3: On April 3, 6 a.m., the consul general embarked for Witu on the corvette "Karola" with the interpreter Dr. Reinhardt, the general representative of the East African Society, Mr. v. Saint=Paul, and 50 Sudanese under the leadership of Lieutenant Theremin. On April 4 at 11 a.m., the "Karola" anchored on the rhede of Lamu and here Mr. Töppen, the representative of the German Witu Society, was taken on board the Karola. At 8 a.m. the next morning, the Consul General then set off for Lamu with Töppen and Dr. Reinhardt in the pinnace under the command of Lieutenant Scheibel, which had the launch manned by the Sudanese in tow, and received the visit of the Vali of Lamu in the large and very comfortably furnished HauTöppens. (Lamu is known to have been assigned to the British sphere of interest as belonging to the Sultan of Zanzibar). At 1 o'clock in the afternoon, the pinnace, again carrying the launch in tow, steamed with the Consul General and his companions through the Lamu Channel to Monumbi, where it landed at about 5½ o'clock in the afternoon. Monumbi lies at the end of a creek running into the country to the south of Lamu, which first runs northwest and finally southwest to south. The village contains about 250 mud huts; the population is quite different from that of Zanzibar, the language of the country Suabeli. Here the Europeans were given apartments in the veranda of the customs house under the Witu flag. (The latter is divided vertically into two fields; the field on the flagstaff is white, the outer field red; in the latter there is a white star. On the 6th at half past three in the morning we set off on the march to Witu. The route first led through a primeval forest, after which we reached a German plantation, Utwaju, belonging to Mr. Dorfer and Mr. Benndorf. Utwain was reached at about 9 o'clock in the morning, and as the march had been very strenuous and the hike extremely long, a rest stop was made at 10 o'clock. The character of the country is savannah-like. Numerous dump palms rise from the savannah. The plantation itself is still in its infancy, the log cabin is under construction. From 10 o'clock in the morning we marched on to a village about ¾ hours before Witu, where we took another short break. At 12½ o'clock the column finally arrived in Witu. Even before reaching the town, three troops arrived with the first of the town, who had set out to meet them for the ceremonial catch-up. At the entrance to Witu itself stood a fourth group and a large troop of Gauls armed with spear and shield, who marched or formed a trellis as the column entered the village, chanting their war song. The village of Witu is nestled in the high jungle. In the village, the sultan's soldiers formed a trellis to the right and left up to the sultan's house, a beautiful, massive stone building. The consul-general and his entourage were led by the town's grandees into a stone house diagonally across from the sultan's house, where everything was prepared for their reception and where a number of the sultan's slaves were assigned to serve them. After a long rest and a meal at about 5 o'clock, Consul General Dr. Michahelles went with Töppen and Dr. Reinhardt for a brief preliminary visit to the Sultan. Then, after a rather meagre dinner, the whole expedition sought early rest. A large veranda-like room served as sleeping quarters, behind which a smaller, unlockable room was reserved for the consul general. The next morning, April 7, 10 a.m., the Sultan's grand reception took place. A number of Sudanese were posted on the left between the house granted to the German legation and the Sultan's palace diagonally opposite, and soldiers and people from Witn lined up opposite them in a large semicircle around the open space in front of the guests' house, on which the flagpole had been erected. At 10 o'clock sharp, the Consul General, followed by Töppen, Vr. Reinhardt and Mr. von Saint=Paul came out of their house at the same time and, on the other hand, the Sultan FumoBakari, followed by his brother, the heir to the throne Fumo=Omari, his uncle Bwana=Mku, his minister Sherif Abdallah and other great men came out of his palace. Both parts walked slowly towards each other alongside the Sudanese troops and the Sultan's troops. The Sultan is of a rather dark complexion, over 40 years old and makes a very intelligent impression, so that he can be considered to be at least on a par with the Sultan of Zanzibar. He wears Arab clothes and was armed with a splendid golden Swahili sword of magnificent workmanship. The successor to the throne looks a little out of sorts, whereas his uncle Bwana=Mku presented himself as a fat, very comfortable-looking gentleman. One of the greats. Mohamed Kanga, the leader of the Sultan's followers, spoke

some German, which he learned from Töppen. (The sultans of Witu belong to the Rebahani family and immigrated 7 to 800 years ago to the island of Patta, which is now in dispute with them See number 2 of this year's German Colonial Newspaper). After greeting each other, the Germans were led into the baraza, the reception room. On the right-hand narrow side of the baraza was the raised throne chair, a magnificent Swahili work of ebony and ivory. On entering the baraza, the Sudanese fired three volleys. The Sultan took his seat on his throne, to his right the Consul General, Töppen, Dr. Reinhardt, Herr von Samt=Paul, to his left the heir to the throne and the grandees, in the background and on both sides all kinds of people from Witu were positioned. After the usual lengthy exchange of courtesies, the main business was the conclusion of the treaty of protection. This treaty fixed the situation that already existed in practice by declaring formal patronage in 6 paragraphs. The interpreter, Dr. Reinhardt, read out the Arabic text of the treaty, then first the Sultan signed it, followed by the Consul General and Töppen, then the Sultan's seal and, through Dr. Reinhardt, the consulate seal were pressed under the treaty. The Sultan kept one copy and the Consul General took one. Once the treaty had been signed and the formalities completed, it was time to present the Emperor with his gifts, which were ceremoniously carried in by five Sudanese non-commissioned officers. The gifts consisted of 1. a picture of the Emperor in Garde du Korpöuniform, 2. a gold watch with chain, 3. a very beautiful hunting rifle. The heir to the throne, Fumo=Omari, and the old Bwana=Mku each received a hunting rifle. After the presentation of the gifts, which were greatly admired and accepted with great thanks, the consul general took his leave and the legation returned to its home in the same manner as at the procession. In the afternoon of the same day, several more conversations took place between the Consul General, Mr. Töppen and the Sultan. At around five o'clock, when the entire German party was enjoying a well-earned siesta, the Sultan suddenly appeared with a great deal of fanfare to pay his unexpected return visit. Later that afternoon, the consul general's companions went to a neighboring Galladors. In order to protect themselves from the Somali invasions and slave raiding, many Gallas had invoked the protection of the Witusultan and settled in a number of small villages in Wituland. In the village, a fellow named Amiri was discovered by chance, who had betrayed and stolen from Peters and Borchert at Kenya. He was captured and put in irons by the Sultan. The Gallas mostly keep cattle in their villages and also do some farming. The women are beautifully built and have pleasant facial features, but their arms and legs are adorned with heavy spiral rings made of brass or copper, which, weighing many pounds, almost cover their limbs. Rings of this kind are highly prized and it was not possible to buy one. In the evening, the Gallas performed one of their great weapon dances, in which Witu people also took part, who had already demonstrated their great archery skills on the way here. (The arrows are poisoned; the poison is prepared by Wasanja people.) On the way back from Witu, the islands of Manda and Patta were visited. On arrival in Lamu, it turned out that the British consul general had also arrived in Lamu on a warship in the meantime - probably for fear that the Germans might create a fait accompli by hoisting the flag on Manda and Patta. It also became apparent that the German company, especially on Lamu, was being watched at every turn. The "Karola" arrived back in Zanzibar on the morning of the 13th. The fighting with Bana Heri. We are able to provide the following account of the battles against Bana Heri on December 27 and January 4 near Mlembule, which is suitable to shed light on the difficulties of both battles and the unexpected tenacity of the resistance: On December 25, Chief Schmidt II was dispatched from Mkwadja against Mlemdule with 250 men of the expeditionary corps and the officers Herr von Bülow and Leutnant Johannes. Mlemdule lies about 10 to 12 kilometers inland from Saadani. The terrain is extremely complex and densely overgrown with bush. On the 26th and 27th of December, there were various isolated small bush battles against Wasegubas; on the 27th in the afternoon, the expeditionary corps arrived on the heights in front of Mlemdule and, when the tip arrived, received heavy fire from all sides from the forest lizards that were occupied everywhere. Chief Schmidt immediately opened fire on the Lisiere with the Teienabteilung and the Maxiimgeschütz and succeeded in clearing the western and southern Lisiere, whereupon Herr von Bülow was dispatched with 50 men to the south in pursuit and Leutnant Johannes to the west. Chief Schmidt continued the fire with a detachment and the Maxim gun against the öftlich and füddöstliche Lisiere in the extraordinarily confusing terrain. In pursuit towards the south, Herr von Bülow found himself suddenly in front of a very strongly fortified boma, one of whose entrances was open to him. Under very heavy fire from the boma, Herr von Bülow attempted the assault, with Sergeant Ludwig and four Zulus playing. The unexpected intensity of the fire and the casualties caused panic among the other Zulus and they ran back, leaving Mr. von Bülow alone with 8 men in front of the bomb. On hearing the news of the unfavorable state of the battle from the Zulus who had run away, Chief Schmidt immediately advanced with about 50 Zulus and the available part of his detachment. (Half of the Sudanese taking part in the expedition were under the command of Lieutenant Johannes, who was in pursuit to the west, while the other half had been left behind with the baggage and Lieutenant Fischer, who had fallen ill). In the meantime, the enemy had closed the boma and it turned out that it was very cleverly equipped with trenches and had an earth covering on the outside, against which the fire did little damage. In the meantime, Herr von Bülow had retreated to within 50 paces of the boma and carried Sergeant Ludwig back with him under enemy fire. From the boma, a continuous heavy fire was maintained, killing four other Zulus and wounding six in addition to the four Zulus who had fallen earlier. The impression of these losses on the Zulus was very depressing. As Chief Schmidt had only Zulus at his disposal, and as Lieutenant Johannes had found resistance in front of a large village while pursuing westwards, and as darkness was finally falling and it was necessary to move the division into brighter terrain in order to set up camp for the night, Chief Schmidt decided to return northwards. The way back was covered by Lieutenant Johannes and his Sudanese, who behaved impeccably and disproportionately better than the Zulus. The retreat was initially obstructed by enemy fire, but the camp was not fired upon. The expedition returned to Mkwadja the next day. According to later statements by Bana Heri himself, the enemy's loss was around 40 dead and many wounded, most of whom had fallen in the lizards. According to Bana Heri, this was the first battle in which he suffered really heavy losses, which made his men very bitter. The losses on the German side were one non-commissioned officer and nine blacks killed, six wounded. When Major Wißmann was informed that reinforcements of troops and artillery were needed for a renewed attack, Wißmann gathered over 500 men and a large number of Europeans, as well as guns of various calibers (6 and 4.2 centimeter guns). After Chief Schmidt von Saadani had sent out a reconnaissance against the other side of the Voma, which had not been fired on in the first battle, and had established the approximate position and strength of the Boma, Wißmann advanced on January 4 with all his troops, divided into two battalions and the artillery. The first battalion, consisting of one Sudanese and three Zulu companies, was led by Mr. von Zelewski, the second battalion, two Sudanese companies and the Askaris, was led by Edef Schmidt, the artillery by Chief Krenzler. The second battalion formed the vanguard on the march, followed by the artillery and then the first battalion. The battle was opened by a 3½-hour firefight (volleys and gunfire), during which 170 grenades and shrapnel were thrown into the boma at a distance of 400 m with good hits. The resistance from the boma was unexpectedly stubborn and was never overcome. After the enemy's fire had weakened somewhat due to the sustained volleys, Major Wißmann ordered Chief Schmidt with three Sudanese companies and the Askaris to attack, not from the north as on December 27, but from the southeast. Up to 25 paces from the boma, the storming detachment was fired upon by volleys, which resulted in a number of wounds; nevertheless, the Sudanese charged forward with a hurrah and succeeded in entering the boma. When the first of them climbed over the boma, the defenders abandoned it on the opposite side. According to later reports by Banaberi, all his sons and Jehasi (Bushiri's former aide-de-camp) were in the boma until the end. Dutch East Indies 1890. by Emil Meyger. (Conclusion. III Atjeh. In its eighteenth year the terrible war is now going on, which is doing so much damage to the cause of the Dutch in India. Their power has lost prestige among Europeans and natives, as they have not been able to force a seemingly insignificant enemy into submission in such a long time. The latter are already sympathetic to their co-religionists, and the good fortune that stands by them strengthens their trust in Allah and reinforces their religious fanaticism; moreover, their eyes have been opened to the true power of the Dutch in Europe, and their opinion of it cannot exactly have been heightened by individual events, such as the violent action of the English in the Nisero affair.

Page 144

Furthermore, the war in Atjeh costs a very considerable sum of money, the amount of which cannot even be approximately determined; perhaps deliberately, the expenses for the war have been mixed up with other expenses in such a way that it is impossible to obtain an approximately exact overview; a few years ago, the author of these lines already estimated it at about 300 million, an amount that has now probably already been considerably exceeded. In any case, a significant part of the current income has been used for this purpose, which has naturally caused the financial economy to suffer. The most serious consequence of the war, and the one that is being felt most keenly at the moment, is the fact that the efficiency of the Indian army has been greatly reduced by the exertions of the various campaigns, by the illnesses that have arisen during, if not as a result of, them, and that the actual number of troops fit for service in the field is considerably smaller than the actual strength. In round numbers, the army consists of 30,000 men, half of whom are Europeans and half natives of various islands. The detachments formed by the latter consist exclusively of European officers; some of the non-commissioned officers and corporals assigned to them are also Europeans. To convince oneself of this, it suffices to compare the mortality rates of earlier years with those recorded now. Despite all the worries, however, the army is suffering greatly under the influence of Beri Beri, that sinister disease whose nature is still a mystery to science and which in recent years has afflicted even the European part of the armed forces in a way that is completely unknown to science. So far, change of location is the only remedy that has brought effective relief in the majority of cases, and change of location, especially residence in a cooler climate, also has such a beneficial effect in many other diseases that it is used in numerous cases. But these numerous transfers deprive the service of thousands of men, some for weeks, others for months, while they travel from one unit to another. The number of people treated in 1885 was 69,358; in 1886: 74,905; in 1887: 78,849; in 1888: 600,533, of which 9.56, 12.55, 8.62 and 11.80% were beri, 27-28% (in 1888 only 20%; not counting the territorial sick, which was the case in earlier years) malaria. The number of Europeans treated amounted to slightly more than 50% of the sick, but is in fairly correct proportion to their total number We have nothing new to add to our earlier judgment on the war (1884 in the Münchener Allgemeine Zeitung No. 193 Beilage and No. 194); the history since then is a series of variations on the earlier theme. Since the beginning of the war, the plan has been repeatedly changed and the execution of the measures decided upon has not always been prepared patiently enough. Thus we see here, too, the vacillation so pernicious to India, manifesting itself at a point where the greatest firmness and even tenacious perseverance in the procedure once decided upon is so necessary. This is the only explanation, even taking into account all the difficulties presented by the theater of war, for the fact that thousands of good men did not succeed in subduing the enemy. The territory taken possession of at the time of the greatest expansion amounted to barely 20 geographical square miles, a considerable part of which has long since been abandoned. Almost no Dutch magazine, no Dutch newspaper can be picked up without the affairs of Atjeh being discussed and the means for its pacification being mentioned. The errors committed in the opinion of the authors of such articles are measured in detail. We do not want to imitate this example here, because basically it is the capital mistakes emphasized above which, taken as a whole, have influenced the course of events, apart of course from the influences from above, which have repeatedly played a major role in this war, in that the troops have been afflicted by cholera and Beri Beri and death has twice chosen its victim among the leaders at the moment of decision. Opinions are sharply divided as to whether the enemy should be tired out by passive perseverance or brought to submission by active action; at the same time, diplomacy is secretly trying to achieve success, whereby it is probably sensible not to save money. Whether the result will be satisfactory, however, remains highly doubtful at the moment. There will be no lasting peace until the last of the Aelyrians has fallen or the people have been completely defeated, for the resistance has been provoked to the utmost by the prolonged conflict. The damaging influence of the long struggle, which we have indicated above, makes it an urgent duty to put an end to the war, even at the greatest sacrifice of men and money. However, even if the most favorable reports are taken as authoritative, the available forces do not seem to be sufficient; apart from the fact that it is claimed by others that there are no more troops capable of fighting at all, one must not send the last troops into such a desperate fight and strip all other possessions of them. A conflict that could bring about a decision would have to be prepared long and carefully; the army would have to be strengthened little by little in order to be able to take up a prolonged battle with the certainty of a good success, and only if one is able to do so is it advisable to attack. For this purpose, it is not enough to beat the recruiting drum a little louder for a few weeks and gather a few hundred or a thousand people to be sent to India untrained, as was done in 1873 and 1874, for example, but to collect them bit by bit, have them trained in Europe by Indian officers, accustom them to strict but humane discipline, in a word, first turn them into soldiers. Only then, when they have become accustomed to the way of life and the food in a good climate in India, send them against the enemy. The recipe is so simple that one must actually be surprised that it has not yet been applied, but it costs a lot of time and a lot of money. The latter was too dear, but the former is not available at all, for who would be able to carry out such a plan with the rapid change of persons and opinions that is usual in Holland? A plan that requires a whole man and an iron will, but also years of effort and perseverance. IV. The opium. There is probably no question concerning the Dutch Indies which occupies the minds of the Dutch more than the opium question. We cannot, of course, attempt to discuss it here in its development; we must content ourselves with emphasizing the most important facts connected with the present state of the question. Opium is smoked almost without exception in the Malay archipelago; those who wish to do so buy their requirements from a tenant and either consume it on the spot in a designated place or take it home with them. The tenant, who is invariably Chinese, has to pay the government a usually very high rent for permission to sell the narcotic and also has to purchase his requirements from it at exorbitant prices, the profit being around 150 percent or more. Thus this vice of their subjects brings quite considerable sums into the coffers of the government, the amount of which has always increased until quite recently; in 1822 it amounted to 1.5 million guilders, in 1855 to 6½, in 1870 to 10½, in 1877 to 13, in 1888 (the maximum) to 20 million guilders, most of which came from Java itself. The government turned the tenants into a power in the state, from which it was able to extract ever higher rents, but of course at the expense of the natives, who the sellers were able to induce to use the opium more extensively by all possible means. In the minds of the officials, however, it was not the desire to collect such large sums in indirect taxes that prompted the method described, but rather the desire to "make opium as expensive as possible for the natives in order to wean them off the vice through the high prices". The fact that the tenants abused their influence could not remain hidden in the long run, in addition to other abuses, among which the government was probably most sensitive to the fact that the smugglers competed with it and sold opium at very cheap prices, indeed that the tenants themselves partially covered their needs in this way and only took as much at a higher price from the government as they had to do decently in order to save appearances. In the last few years, the government has sold less opium than usual and has therefore lost part of the hoped-for profit. It is impossible to say in a few words what a cancer this lease has become for the country and how thoroughly corrupt some conditions have become. Everywhere one finds the spies of the tenant, who lie in wait for the transgressors of the law, and also for the innocent *) As an exception, the government does not exercise a monopoly in individual possessions. Cf. Meyger. Opium in Indonesia. Revuo Colon. Interont., also reprinted in Oester. Monatsschr. s. d. Orient 1887. X-XII.

cause harm. Anyone who is found to be in possession of opium must provide proof that he has come into possession of it by legal means, otherwise he will be punished; in this way many a disagreeable person has certainly been removed and many a person has been forced to do the will of the tenant or his henchmen. Corruption is also active in other ways; with marvelous skill, the tenants know how to make the most diverse people who can be useful to them and their interests agreeable through gifts. False accusations have repeatedly been established by judicial findings; with regard to bribery this has only rarely been successful, although the fact of it is probably never denied. The law has so far been powerless against smuggling; it has been pursued on land and water, but in vain. At first this fact was not admitted, but at last it had to be conceded; we shall presently learn the consequences of this realization. The simplest remedy against smuggling, the sale of opium to the tenants at cost price and in unlimited quantities, was not even attempted. The reason is obvious: the officially known consumption would have experienced a significant increase (in fact, however, no more would have been consumed than before, because the contraband would have disappeared), and so it would have had to be openly advocated that "restriction" of opium use was not the real purpose. I pick up the thread of the story again. The storm against the opium policy roared violently when a new minister came to power, who was expected to take decisive measures against the vice because of his religious views. For the time being, and in anticipation of a new organization, the lease was only granted for one year, a few more were added to the districts where the use had previously been completely prohibited, and it was also stipulated, under severe penalty, that the sale could only take place in the places designated for this purpose. As a result of these measures, the budget shows a shortfall in rents (in 1890 they amounted to only 14,706,000, and the gross revenue from opium sold was 3,395,000 fl.) Of course, the views on the position that the government should take with regard to opium are very different; we can only go into the prevailing direction of these views here One takes the view that suppressing the use of opium is impossible, ergo the interests of the state demand that advantage be taken of this evil as far as the dignity of the government allows, and the "Antiopiumbund", which has of course also been formed, seems to see the ideal in an organization in which no one has a direct interest in the use of the narcotic. Such an organization is believed to have been found in the government (which has also existed in Cochinchina since 1883), in which the government retains the monopoly but manages the sale itself through its employees. The license system is no longer under consideration. The dispute between the supporters of the leasehold and those of the Regie is raging fiercely; since the latter seems to be the winner, we will take a closer look at their plans, although of course we will skip the technical side altogether. They believe they have found in this organization an excellent means of "gradually suppressing use by first ruining smuggling through cheap prices and then raising prices; they foresee that this will not succeed all at once and reckon on about 30 years. If consumption has decreased to such an extent that the government is making a loss, one may well assume that prosperity has also increased to such an extent that other honest taxes and duties will compensate the state for what it sacrifices for the welfare of the population." Mau calculates the costs of the government (in any case far too low) at 9¼ million, the net revenue at almost 14½ million. To carry out this measure, an army of opium sellers is to be taken into the service of the government. It would appear that, to use a crude expression, the devil is to be driven out by Beelzebub. The fact that the writer of these lines is certainly no friend of the leasehold system has been sufficiently demonstrated by his above-mentioned essay, which is frequently quoted, but the government also seems to him to be bringing about very serious evils. First of all, from a moral point of view, it is a great grievance that the state itself should set up an organized service to serve the spread of this evil to the remote villages; it has even been suggested that the local chiefs should be entrusted with the sale. Then the army of public servants employed in the same (who are surrounded with a certain nimbus in the eyes of the natives), the procurement of which, moreover, will not be easy, is by no means favorable, and finally it is at least doubtful whether it will be pressed The main disadvantage, however, lies in the fact that the fir will probably be much less favorable than one assumes; Experience will have to teach us how much of this will remain in the execution. In the case of the Chinese leasehold system, it has already been sadly experienced that the development of conditions can be quite different from what was expected. The fact that the Chinese tenants have gained too much influence in the latter is due to the government itself, which has not opposed this and has not applied the laws as it should have done. In view of the present financial situation, however, it seems irresponsible for us to venture such an experiment as the one indicated, the results of which are at least doubtful. If the state is compelled to encourage the use of opium, then at least we should not be caught off guard and try to extract as much money as possible from this monopoly. If one does not want to soil one's hands with it, then it is easy to let the poor, industrious Javanese farmers, who are oppressed by taxes, benefit from it, and it is in any case more correct to take the money voluntarily sacrificed by the population through indirect taxation, i.e. through the monopoly of a stimulant, than to do this in the form of other taxes that weigh heavily on the whole. V. The inhabitants and the financial economy. Among the inhabitants of the Indian possessions, those of the island of Java contribute a very considerable part to the expenses of the state administration of the whole archipelago; out of 94.8 millions to be received in India according to the estimate for 1890*), 75.2 millions are received in Java; moreover, the Javanese have the largest share in the production of the treasury sold in the Netherlands, the yield of which is estimated at more than 29 million guilders. In the following we will only deal with Java, as the conditions in the other possessions are too different and have too little influence on the whole for us to go into them in detail here. In addition to their labor, the amount of which cannot be roughly estimated in figures, the natives make a considerable contribution in cash to the sums mentioned. For example, the Javanese farmers, barely 3 million in number, pay 16 million guilders in land tax, and it must be mentioned with praise that a reduction of about 20 percent has occurred here in recent years. Furthermore, the non-farming Javanese, together with the Chinese and other Orientals, contribute about 2.5 million in occupational tax, and the Javanese alone contribute 2.7 million for exemption from certain voluntary services. The government derives more than 13 million from the rents; the above has already been said about the opium rents and the profit resulting from the sale of the article connected with the monopoly. Among the other rents, those for the slaughter of animals (12 million) and those of the pawnshops (1.1 million) yield the greatest revenue. Of the 50 million import duties, a considerable part is borne by the natives, whose consumption of salt (government monopoly) amounts to 6.5 million. This is a heavy burden for the population, which is made even heavier by the way in which it has to be borne. Apart from having to provide monetary services, the indigenous population also has to perform work in the interests of the state and the community (this should be distinguished from the cultural services in the coffee plantations, which are paid for; on how? see 1I above). The hardship connected with the services, if their duration is not extended beyond the legal time, lies less in the effort they require than in the fact that the native is never master of his own time, for he never knows if and when he will be called away from his own, perhaps quite urgent, work, from the cultivation of his fields, from any profit-promising business he has undertaken, in order to work without pay for the government or for his community.

closely supervised labor services until the natives have the opportunity to earn money in order to finally contribute to the costs of the state. As far as earning money is concerned, things look pretty bad at the moment; the vast majority of the population earns what they need to live on through their own economy; only work in the government plantations and the free planters, individual services of various kinds, some small-scale industry and finally the sale of the generally insignificant surpluses from their own business provide them with cash. In recent years, most of the plantations have had lower yields and have generally been operating under unfavorable conditions for a number of years; as a result, little is fixed for the former, albeit only on paper, so the latter are left to the arbitrariness of the local chiefs and are therefore even more oppressive. The state's demands in terms of cash payments have increased. These must be met at all costs; the land tax is collected by the village heads, who receive 8 percent as compensation, but are responsible for collecting the amounts. It is obvious that under these circumstances the defaulters do not have a pleasant life, and it is not surprising that in recent years a lot of silver money, which may have been buried in the ground for decades and inherited jewelry, has passed into the hands of the collectors. In addition to paying taxes, the natives must have some hard cash to purchase items that they need to live, but which they cannot obtain through their own economy. These include salt, a government monopoly that yields a handsome profit. In reality, however, it is much more expensive for the natives than the official figures suggest, as these articles are only sold in large quantities from the warehouses and only come into their hands from the third or fourth hand, usually made more expensive by three- and four-fold usury. The rents, one of which we have already become acquainted with, have a very detrimental effect on the condition of the people for various reasons, because they are in the hands of the Chinese, and the government has actually allowed them too much leeway, especially in recent years, when all revenues have been increased as much as possible. It is not possible here to even briefly outline the role played by the Chinese in the Dutch Indian possessions; we must confine ourselves to a few words about them as tenants. Like all his compatriots, the tenant farmer has one unchanging goal in mind, namely to acquire as much money as possible. However, he is not a miser in the spirit of Harpagon, but also puts considerable sums at risk if he can hope to make a corresponding profit from this sacrifice. This is why he is very generous to those who can be useful to him if he can hope to win them over - as already mentioned above with regard to the opium tenants. In his eyes, these also include the government, and he gladly shows his willingness to do so by paying a higher rent if he is told by the right authority that he can make himself agreeable in this way, and this often happens, Since the government began to levy taxes on Europeans, Chinese, natives and foreign Orientals in a really petty manner, it has also understood how to drive up rents. We have already seen one example above (opium rent); a second, which concerns the pawnshops, may be mentioned here. In 1880 this rent brought in 110,000 fl., in 1883 already 600,000 fl., now 1070,000 fl. It is easy to see that the tenants would not have been inclined to pay such a much higher rent if the government had not granted them advantages that more than compensated for the sacrifice. The same government that abolished the system of privileged pawnbrokers in 1869, because its pernicious effect on the natives had been recognized, reintroduced it in 1880; some measures had indeed been taken to protect the pawnbrokers, but when, as a result of this circumstance, the rent bids fell short of expectations, they were withdrawn again. Incidentally, the Chinese who are in the interior, including the tenants, are strongly suspected of being the best supporters of the opium smugglers. It is an old, convenient practice for the government to use the tenants to collect certain taxes; if it only receives its share, it cares little whether they make a huge profit, in other words, suck the natives dry at will. Incidentally, the tenants do not always show good will towards the government, as they often form congies (rings) that know how to set the prices of the rents according to their own will. The situation of the Europeans has also not been very favorable in recent years, although their justified complaints were met to some extent not so long ago. The recently departed colonial minister seems to have intended to take further measures to encourage European planters; we will perhaps return to this point later Outside Java, the European agriculture industry is not yet of great importance, with the exception of the Deli landscape in NE Sumatra. Sumatra, whose name is often used as an umbrella term for the various districts in which the plantations are located, although this is actually incorrect, and which is well-known enough throughout the world because of the excellent tobacco and the golden rain which the latter has brought to the planters. Descriptions from Cameroon. By Georg Baldan. The Nio des Rey and its river basin. - Fahrl still Balunde and Nem. (continued). Due to their good discipline and diligence, the mountain tribes initially regarded our Krubops as our slaves, and more than once demanded to be able to buy some of them. They did not want to believe that our people were free men, for how would it be possible for a free man to adopt such strict discipline? They themselves would not do it, no matter how much they were paid. Even their slaves do not do half as much work as our criminals. Now, however, there has been a significant change in opinion, for we have succeeded in recruiting Bakwiri men and, more recently, some Bomboko men for our service for longer or shorter periods. Although they are not yet skilled workers, we cannot expect so much from people who are unaccustomed to work. However, the experiment with some of them has been quite satisfactory, and we are using more and more native workers every year. In the morning, all the chiefs and noble men of the village came to have a "palaver" about the sale of the village. The chiefs sat on chairs and stools, and the others gathered close together as far as the space of the courtyard allowed. I opened the negotiations by explaining that I had come here at their request, and now that I had seen the village, I was inclined to buy them and, in that case, to trade with them. The noblest chief then reported on everything that had happened since Kautson's visit and concluded by thanking me for coming, which everyone was very pleased about. This was followed by a discussion of the purchase price, and after we had agreed on a price acceptable to both parties, the contract was written and signed. The chief and the sub-chiefs each received their gift, and the noblest of them also received a written agreement for payment, which the village was to collect 16 days later against payment of the aforementioned debt in Bibundi. After this was done, we prepared to continue our march to the next village, despite all the efforts of the people to make us stay until the next day. When they saw that all their efforts were in vain, they took what they considered to be an infallible remedy. They offered me the biggest and fattest cow in the village as a present if I would delay my departure. However, as I knew from experience that my sore foot would not allow me to walk after a few days, I wanted to make the best use of this time and therefore, to my great astonishment, refused their generous offer. It should be noted here that, next to the slaves, the horn cattle are the most important possession of the Balundu people. They have a large number of slaves, most of whom come from Basom and other areas north-east of Mbu. Among the surrounding peoples, pasture is the man's most important possession, but here she is free, i.e. she can choose her husband herself and he can take her as his wife without having to pay a large sum for it. One must not, however, believe that this is why marriages are made out of love, for the simple reason that this expression of feeling is unknown to the rulers. Here, too, it is common for them to prefer a certain person to others, but this feeling never rises to the level of love. Here in the crude and primitive Balundu, the motives of the Eben are on the whole the same as those which are not uncommon in educated and refined Europe, namely, chiefly reckoning. Among the poor, the mutual demands are not so great, and as the needs are very small in this country, poverty is seldom an obstacle to marriage. A rich man looks for a wife from a rich and powerful family in order to strengthen his status and position. A girl preferably seeks a rich man *) What we have said above with regard to the opium tenants applies to all tenants; they have become a power in the state, which some would like to see completely removed from the interior. We can only repeat that it is the government's own fault if the tenants, or the Chinese in general, grow over its head
