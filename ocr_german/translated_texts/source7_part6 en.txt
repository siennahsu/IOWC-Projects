and then traveled to Frankfurt. In the former city he was celebrated by the municipal authorities, in the latter by the department of the German Colonial Society and the Geographical Society. - (The board of the Lübeck section) has finally been constituted and consists of the following gentlemen: Chairman Director Bruhn, Deputy Chairman A. Bredmer, Secretary Major (ret.) v. Koschitzky, Deputy Secretary Oberledrer Dr. Hausberg, Treasurer Kaufmann C. Reuter, Consul Grupe and Major v. Schirach. Small announcements. - (His Majesty the Emperor) has provided the sum of 3000 marks for the construction of a steamer on the Viktoria Nyanza. (Major von Wißmann) traveled from Bremen to Hamburg, where a festival was held in his honor. There, too, Wißmann called on the assembly to support the efforts for East Africa by donating a steamer on the Victoria Nyanza. Wißmann, Captain von Gravenreuth and Dr. Bumiller returned from there to Berlin, where he again made himself available to the Foreign Office. - (German East Africa). The tug of the German-East African line "Reichstag", which ran aground in the harbor of Dar es Salaam in the inner harbor, where the fairway is very narrow, has left again undamaged and will continue its journey to Mozambique. - As opinions differ on the quality of the harbor of Dar es Salaam, it is probably appropriate to refer to the official material available in the Annalen der Hydrographie and the Africa Pilot. The Annalen wrote in 1886: "The harbor is spacious and extremely well protected, but the winding entrance is very narrow and the entrance is made even more difficult by the strong current. However, with proper buoyage or with good directional beacons, it would also be possible for steamers with a draught of 6 m and more to enter the harbor at high water, ships up to 5 m at any water level, and the time of low water is the most favorable because the cracks are then quite sharply marked. At high tide, the latter cannot be seen and in this case, buoys and beacons are indispensable for unfavorable lighting, since orientation on the chart during the entry is impossible." In 1889, according to the reports of S. M. S. "Olga", precise instructions for the entrance were given and noted: "Before the ship passed through the narrow entrance channel, marker buoys were laid out on the southern tip of North Sand Head, on the sand spit extending into the fairway to the west of 3 fathoms (55 m), and on the banks jutting out at Eaft and West=Ferry Point. With these aids, and since the reef and the banks were clearly visible at low tide, there was no difficulty in sailing in." The stranding is known to have occurred between these two points. This dangerous passage is described in the Africa Pilot as follows: The narrow entrance to the narrow harbor of Dar=es=Salaam is not easy to find, even from the anchorage in the bay. It lies between the red cliffs of Ras Rongoni and Chokir, through a steep break in the coral reef that lines the shore. The break in the reef at the entrance is about 1¾ cable lengths wide and narrows to 1 cable length at low water. A rocky strip juts into the channel from North Sand Head in a south-westerly direction and presents the greatest difficulty in entering, as the channel narrows to 120 yards at the point where it is necessary to turn: from there the channel goes straight out to East Ferry Point and has a depth of 2l feet, with the exception of a point where at a depth of 16 feet dei Edbe is a sandbank about 4 cables long from East Ferry Point. This bank can be navigated around on both sides, but is difficult to avoid for the stranger as long as it is not secured with a buoy." The Africa Pilot's comments on the inner harbor, whose water is deep enough for anchoring, are also of general interest. "The banks are steep. There is room for a large number of ships and yet not enough room to create a swell in a storm, so that even boat traffic is completely unhindered. Dar=es=Salaam is the natural great trading place of the east coast and was already recognized as such by the late Sultan of Sanstbar, Sevid Majid, who undertook great constructions and intended to direct the Bagamopo trade here. His death put an end to these plans." The Unker ground near the city is about 34 miles long. The plan to divert trade away from Bagamovo, which is likely to be resumed today, is therefore a very old one. - The telegraphic connection from Zanzibar to Bagamovo and Dar es Salaam has been established, thus fulfilling an important precondition for business development on the coast. - The "Nat.=Ztg." was provided with a report by Dr. Ookar Baumann from Kwamgumi (Korogwe) on his journey in the Pare Mountains by the German East African Society. According to the report, the Pare Mountains present themselves as an ascending mountain wall with little latitudinal development. Steppe vegetation predominates at the foot of the mountain, above which there is a cultivated area with native fields and hamlets, with numerous watercourses and artificial irrigation ditches, open, fertile land similar to Jagga. The last highest third of the slopes is high pasture land, characterized by low, soft grass. Heather and ferns as well as scattered patches of grass. The stocky, short-horned breed of Pare= cattle thrives here. The natives, the Wapare, live in scattered huts. The system of small irrigation canals is particularly remarkable, the water of which is cleverly diverted from the streams and - often even with a slight incline - directed along the slopes. Where leytere are steep, the fields are graded by good dry stone walls. Cattle breeding has suffered greatly from the raids of the surrounding Negro tribes, especially the Maasai. Protection from them is primarily what the Wapare hope for from us Germans. As far as the Pare Mountains in general are concerned, they form an important middle link between Usambara and Kilimanjaro. The preconditions for a reasonable development are in place. Baumann then moved to Usegua and North Nguru. Northern Usegua presents itself as a gently undulating land of great fertility, criss-crossed by broad valley forests. The traveler wandered for hours through sorghum (mtama) fields. However, cattle breeding also suffers here from the invasions of the Maasai, and it would really be time if this evil were thoroughly controlled. The East African Protection Force has been placed under the Foreign Office and its local representative, Prime Lieutenant Bertbold, has been assigned to the Colonial Department. - Emin Pasha has arrived in Unvanvembe Peters and Jackson). According to the "Münchner Allgemeine Zeitung", the fact that Mr. Jackson was concerned in East Africa with nothing less than the arrest of Dr. Peters, an intention whose implementation would probably not have been so simple but would probably have led to a bloody clash, will be of interest in wide circles. In a letter dated March 6 and received by the King of Uzanda on March 19, Jackson informed the King that he was charged with the arrest of Peters; since he could not carry it out himself, he requested the King to do so. (Jackson had 500 suidergewebre at his disposal. The King drafted this letter for reading in the presence of Peters in the public council, spat on the letter and threw it behind him, declaring that he knew nothing of Jackson and the English, but on the contrary wanted to protect Peters, to whom he put 2000 Uganda warriors at his disposal to attack Jackson. Mr. Jackson could therefore have easily paid dearly for his ludicrous plan. Rumors were now spread by the British to hold Peters until Jackson's arrival in Uganda that enemy armies were approaching. Peters told the king that he would fight with him against them, but that if the rumors were unfounded, he would move on immediately. This was on Monday, March 24. After Peters' scouts had established that the rumours were unfounded, the expedition set out on its onward march on 26 March With reference to our note in No. 16 of the Deutsche Kolonialzeitung, we are in a position to inform you that Mr. Sachse, Director of the Imperial Post Office, was appointed an official member of the Board of Directors of the German East African Society by order of the Imperial Chancellor as early as mid-July. (The French in the hinterland of Cameroon.) We have already referred several times to the attempts of the French to extend their territory from Udangdi to the north and west and in this way to limit the westward expansion of our hinterland of Cameroon. The French would like to play the same role here vis-à-vis the Germans as the English did vis-à-vis the Portuguese on the Schire, but if they regard treaties between travelers and previous tribes of the Jnnern as sufficient titles of ownership, no one will give them much credit. But it is characteristic of the efforts of the French that, provided the information is correct, they already extend to the territory over which a border agreement has already been reached between Germany and France. Thus Cholet, a colonial commissioner, has explored the Sanga, a right tributary of the Congo, and in doing so has reached as far as the 4th degree north. B. and 13 degrees E. L., i.e. beyond the 15th degree E. L., which the French, albeit erroneously, claim to be the eastern border of our Cameroon territory. Along this river, he has penetrated into the region of the Sudan grasslands, which has become better known through the areas of Kund and Tappenbeck, probably as far as the watershed of the tributaries of the Congo and the Sannaga and Niong rivers flowing into Cameroon. The explorer has found a rich country that has not yet been touched by Europeans, and the French newspapers seem very keen to make claims based on this information. It is becoming increasingly necessary for the German side to advance eastwards beyond the Jännde station in the hinterland of Great Batanga in order to put a definitive stop to all French desires for our hinterland. - (Railroad in the tropics.) The undertakings for the purpose of building the Congo Railway, which, as is known, is operated by a separate company, are worthy of note for a later time, when the railroad construction of German East Africa will be considered. As is well known, the purpose of the railroad is to connect the mouth of the Congo with Stanley Pool, where the shipping, which is hindered by the abundance of water in the lower course, can sail in again. it is therefore a relatively limited undertaking. The expedition simply followed the left bank of the Congo, there were no bridges to cross, but the many watercourses had to be crossed. The worst part was a short mountainous stretch close to the starting point of the route, where a stream and mountains had to be crossed in narrow serpentines; but after studying the trace once again, a more advantageous route was discovered or at least believed to have been found. At the moment, Matadi is already in full swing, with 86 Europeans and 1200 blacks alone, the latter Zanzibarites, Senegalese, Kruboys and Uccras, busy there, who first built the Matadi railroad station largely out of iron and constructed the magazines, landing places, etc. Several kilometers of earthworks had already been completed in Turbi and it was already possible to calculate approximately what the construction of the various sites would cost and what the work of the blacks would be like. Although exact figures could not yet be obtained, it was clear from the information provided by the officials that the Negro was a capable earthworker. The cost of the 400) square meters of earth thrown up was even less than the estimate had envisaged, even though

Page 244

 the blacks were initially very unfamiliar with this work. The experiences made with the West African Negroes in the trades, on the other hand, were not so favorable; as bricklayers they cannot be compared with the Enropaeans, and as blacksmiths and carpenters they do little, but the latter craftsmen are less important than the earthworkers. - The French are pursuing the Traussahara Railway project with great zeal. The government has sent specialists to Rußlank to find out about the method of railroad construction used by General Annenkoff. At the same time, they are to study the protective measures used on the Trans-Caspian Railway against drifting sand. The German railroad projects in East Africa are also all more or less based on the Russian system, which has the advantage of being very cheap and is currently the best example of a pioneer railroad. - (Successes of Italian colonial policy.) In the Italian parliament, the state of the Italian colonies in Africa was recently outlined as follows. "Italy, as Emperor of Athiopia, recognized the King of Shoaan, who in turn acknowledged the fact of the Italian occupation of the most fertile provinces of the Tigre. On May 2, 1889, a treaty was signed at Uchalli between Italy and the new emperor, according to which the Italian protectorate was extended to the entire Ethiopian Empire, including Harrar and Kaffa. A treaty with the Sultan of Harar provided for a good road from Assab to Shoa. All this was achieved within a year and shows that Italy, although late to Africa, knew how to take the right path there. The Sultan of Midschertin placed the territory from Cape Beduin (north of the mouth of the Nogal) to Cape Auad under Italian protection, and undertook not to conclude any treaties with other powers for the remaining parts of his territory, which ends at 49 degrees east longitude from Greenwich on the Gulf of Aden. The sultan of Obbia has his territory, which extends from Cape Anad to Mesegh. 32.30 degrees north latitude, was also placed under Italian protection. The coast of Benadir, bounded on the north by the Sultanate of Obbia and on the south by the mouth of the Dschub, was declared to be under Italian protectorate (by means of notifications of the signatory powers of the Treaty of Berlin), with the exception of the stations in this area which are under the Sultan of Sanstbar; negotiations are in progress with a view to placing the administration of these in Italian hands. Taken together, these territories are about five times the size of Italy, with an uninterrupted coastline of 1900 kilometers. They include the rich valleys on the left bank of the Djub as far as the lands tributary to Atbiopia, and the regions of Ogaden and Wadi=Nogal, which are very fertile due to the Webi and Nogal rivers. This work, carried out with the consent of the nations most closely involved, on the one hand prevents foreign influences from the Indian Ocean from asserting themselves in the richest and less supervised areas of Athiopia, and on the other hand it provides the Italians with an extensive field of activity in which Italian trade and the strong arm and patient diligence of the peasant can reap a rich harvest." Entrances for the library. Given the limited space available to us for book reviews, it will not be possible to discuss all works in detail, but we never fail to recommend new colonial writings, which are assigned to our library by the authors and publishers, to colonial friends in word and deed, for which the administration of the library is given ample opportunity by our members We hereby once again express our sincere thanks for the books donated to our library.

The collections for the steamships projected by Major v. Wißmann on the Central African lakes are making good progress, but the sums received so far are not yet sufficient to fully initiate this important patriotic undertaking in an appropriate manner. We therefore repeatedly ask our friends to work in their circles to ensure that German power gains a firm foothold on the Great Lakes as soon as possible: to suppress the slave trade, to benefit German trade and to secure our political reputation in East Africa. Contributions will be accepted by the German Colonial Society, Linkstraße 25. To the memory of Carl Claus von der Decken. († October 2, 1865 at Berdera.) From his former companion Dr. Otto Kersten. Almost 25 years ago, the news of the murder of the explorer Carl von der Decken spread throughout Europe. Since Dr. Vogel's expedition to the Saharan countries, none of the numerous expeditions to Africa at that time had captured the general interest in Germany to such an extent, and none had been expected to achieve greater success, not only for science, but also for the honor of the German name and for the expansion of our economic area. Never before had a private individual spent such significant funds on an African expedition, and never before had practical goals been so clearly defined. What more could have been expected of this man of indomitable energy if fortune had favored him just a little and if inexorable death had not so quickly put an end to his labors! Although von der Decken's travels have generally not yet been forgotten despite the long time that has passed in between, it will not be unwelcome to most, especially younger friends of German colonial policy, to obtain a brief overview of his work in East Africa from the following information. 1860: Arrival in Zanzibar (28 July); journey via Kiloa to Mesule (on the road to Lake Ryassa) to investigate Dr. Albrecht Roscher, who was murdered on Lake Nyassa on 19 March 1860 (30 September to the end of the year). 1861: Trip to Mombas and the Pangani River (February 22 to March 3); first Jagga trip with the English geologist Richard Thornton via Mombas, the Kadiaroberg, Kisuani, Taveta, Kilema, (with ascent of Kilimanjaro to 8000 feet), Madschame and Wanga (May 28 to October 11); trips from Mombas to Takaungu and Malindi (early November). 1862: Excursion to Bagamoyo and Magagoni (January); *) According to the "Datumanzeiger" in the von der Deckenschen Reisewerke published by me (vol. II p. 396 fl.; a "Lebensbild" of the deceased can be found there (p. 378 ff.).
Visit to the west coast of Madagascar (near Minterano and Kanatzi, February and March); second Jagga journey with Dr. O. Kersten via Mombas, Wanga, Pare= and Usanga region, Aruscha, Uru, Kilema (with ascent of Kilimanjaro to 14,000 feet), Bura= and Rdarage region (August 19 to December 26). 1863: Visit to Lamu (1) Ibo and the Komoro island of Anjuani (Johanna, in March); journey to the island of Röunion (Bourbon, with ascent of the volcano and the Piton des Neiges rc.) via the Seschellen and Mauritius (April 11 to August 12) and return to Europe from the Seschellen, while Dr. Kersten returns to Zanzibar and from there visits Wanga, Muoa and the Kingani River with Alfred Grandidier (October and November). 1864: Von der Decken's activities in Europe to procure a steamer and prepare for a new expedition; re-arrival in Zanzibar through the Suez Canal with the Austrian naval captain von Schickh (September 1); arrival of the new expedition members (Dr. Linck, painter Trenn, forester Brenner and others) on O'Swald's sailing ship "New=Orleans", which also brought the entire equipment, including a large and a small river steamer (November 30); start of the construction of the larger steamer "Welf" (December 18). During von der Decken's absence: Dr. Kersten's trip to Nossibé and the Comoros with stays on Nossibe, Murunsanga (Northwest=Madagascar), the Komoro islands of Moali (Mohilla and Angasija (Great Komoro, with ascent of the volcano), in Mnasi (at the mouth of the Ruvuma) and on the islands of Schole and Masia (February 20 to June 4, 1864). 1865: Started riveting together the "Welf" after completion of the preliminary assembly (January 3); visit to Formosabai on the French warship "Loiret" and navigation of the Osi River to Kau (discovery of the Beledsoni Channel and the Tana River by means of the small von der Decken steamer "Passepartout" accompanied by Dr. Linck and R. Brenner (February 8-20); Dr. Kersten's return to Europe (February 26, due to illness). Voyage north on the "Welf" in the company of the English war steamer "Lyra" to Lamu (June 15 to 17, 1865); examination of the Tula and Shamba rivers (cholera on board from July 8 to 18), visit to Kiama Island and the port of Kismaio (Cape Bissel, June 19 to July 28). July); first visit to the mouth of the Djuba (July 27 and 28); entry of the "Welf" (120 feet long and more than 30 feet wide above the wheel wells!) into the Djuba River, where the small steamer "Passepartout" is lost on the bar and the engineer Hitzmann drowns (July 29). July 1865); taking in the mouth of the river and excursions in the area around Jumbo (August 1 to 13); sailing upstream past Hindi and the Wabuni villages (August 15 to 26); moored for the first time (4 feet draught!) at Wegere (August 27 to 30); continuing past Anole to Bardera (August 31 to September 19) and staying there. August to September 19) and stay there (September 20 to 24); arrival before the rapids (September 25), where the "Welf" ran aground the following day without being able to get away again; attack on the camp on the right bank of the river by Somali hordes and

 Killing of Trenn and Kanter (machine master from the Austrian navy, on October 1) while von der Decken returned with Dr. Linck in his gig to Bardera, where he and Dr. Linck were murdered by the Somalis (on October 2 and 4 respectively), as was later established. Return journey of those remaining (5 Europeans and 8 Reger), who believed the Baron had already been murdered) on the large boat under the leadership of v. Schickh to the mouth of the river and hike to Kismaio (October 1 to 6, 1865); return journey to Zanzibar on a coastal ship via Tula, Lamu and Mombas (October 6 to 22). October); futile investigations by Schickh and his companions in Lamn, Tula, etc. with the help of the Somali abbot Auwesi, who finally advised a speedy return because the excitement was very great everywhere (October 29 to mid-November); return of the rescued to Europe (December 13, 1865 to April 4, 1866). This was a shattering conclusion to Carl Claus von der Decken's undertakings, which had always grown in size, and his generous efforts to open up new economic areas at a time when Germany was still torn by factions and hardly anyone appreciated the value of such action! Since the fate of the missing man had not yet been fully ascertained, his family immediately took all steps that seemed necessary to rescue the voyager and his last companion (Dr. Linck), if at all possible. First of all, von der Decken's mother, Princess Adelheid von Pleß, sent out the former consular official Theodor Kinzelbach, who had been recommended to her by Dr. Brugsch from Cairo and who arrived in Aden on September 25, 1865, where he was joined exactly one month later by Richard Brenner, who had been commissioned by the traveller's brother, Baron Julius von der Decken. The development of these two independent ventures can be seen in the following summary: 1866: Arrival of Brenner and Kinzelbach in Brawa on board the English warship Highflyer (November 20), where Brenner stayed to make inquiries and investigate the Wobbi River, while Kinzelbach took a detour (via the Seschellen) on the Highflyer to Zanzibar (arrival on December 28). 1867: Brenner's departure from Brawa (January 14), stay in Kismaio with exploration of the Wubushi River (Durnford, January 15 to February 19) and arrival in Zanzibar (February 26), where Kinzelbach is still busy interrogating the raiders who escaped during the raid. This is followed by Brenner's travels in the land of the southern Galla (March 12, 1867 to early 1868). In the meantime, Kinzelbach arrives in Brawa (April 26); after futile efforts to reach Bardera itself from there and from Merka, he travels inland to Geledi, from whose sultan he hopes to receive support (December 15?) and dies soon afterwards in Sigala; Kinzelbach's funeral takes place on the beach at Makdischu!From the reports of the two commissioners it emerged at least this much (see v. d. Deckens Reisen II. p. 356 ff.) that the death of Carl Claus von der Deckens and Dr. Hermann Linck could no longer reasonably be doubted. The family of the deceased now only had the duty to erect a monument to him that was worthy of his endeavors; they fulfilled this duty by granting the author of these lines the means to publish a book without any restrictions, in which not only the wanderings and journeys of the deceased were reported in detail, but also his and his companions' collections and observations were used in the most extensive way for a fundamental presentation of the entirety of our knowledge of Central East Africa at that time. In this way, von der Decken's travel work was created, of which only the first two volumes, the narrative part, have found a wider distribution, while the four volumes of the scientific section!) were received with great appreciation in the relevant professional circles. Since around 70,000 marks were spent on the publication of this work, a brilliant effort had been made to safeguard von der Decken's memory, but nothing had yet been done to continue his research and pursue his plans. Nothing more could be expected from the family of the unfortunate traveler than what they *) Volume III. I. Zoology, edited by W. Peters, J. Cabanis, E. von Martens. F. Hilgendorf and C. Semper; III.

had already done, especially since the conditions in Somaliland at that time were not particularly favorable for travel ventures; moreover, it seemed to be more a matter for the scientific societies to resume the work of the Deckens. From this side, however, not the slightest thing happened, and the funds available to them were used for the most diverse other areas, but not for the exploration of Somaliland, where von der Decken's work had been interrupted so abruptly! The fact that a debt of honor had to be repaid here was admitted in many cases, but because national sentiment was not yet sufficiently developed at the time, it was considered more interesting and more convenient to help further explore the areas opened up by famous foreigners, namely Livingstone and Stanley Of course, as von der Decken's surviving companion, I felt a lively obligation, to constantly advocate the fulfillment of his spiritual testament, but only after long futile efforts did I succeed in finding two young men, the brothers Clemens and Gustav Denhardt, who took up Decken's ideas again and continued them with zeal and tenacity despite their very limited means. They were joined by a young military doctor, Dr. G. A. Fischer, who later separated from them and then, after thoroughly studying the bird life of the island of Zanzibar during a stay of several years there as a general practitioner on the basis of von der Decken's travel book, undertook a journey through Massailand that became famous. The Denhardt brothers had unfortunately had to abandon their original plan of exploring the Djuba River from Bardera to the borders of Abyssinia because they did not have enough money to buy the necessary steamer; however, they had a successful voyage on the Tana River, which had also become famous through Decken's voyages, and after many worries and disappointments they managed to raise the funds for a second expedition to the same region, whose favorable location and wealth they had come to appreciate. In the meantime, national sentiment in Germany had strengthened to such an extent that a resumption of the most important idea of the Deckens, the acquisition of land for the purpose of expanding the German economic area, could be considered with a prospect of success. Soon after my return, inspired by numerous discussions with von der Decken on this subject, I endeavored with like-minded friends*) to explain the feasibility of a Prussian or German colonial policy in words and writing. The war of 1866, however, put an end to these efforts, and it was only after the Franco-Prussian War that a small number of patriotic-minded friends (E. Braß, R. Gellert, Dr. Jannasch and others) came together to found an association which set itself the task of promoting and cultivating the colonial idea and, in particular, of striving for a beneficial utilization of the surplus of our population by directing the emigration, which was very strong at the time. This oldest colonial society, the Centralverein für Handelsgeographie und Förderung deutscher Interessen im Auslande, was followed after several years by the Frankfurter Kolonialverein, which later moved its headquarters to Berlin and, under the commendable leadership of Prince Hohenlohe-Langenburg, was very successful in getting one of the most influential political parties of the time interested in colonial policy. In the field of von der Decken's work, however, neither of these two associations was able to achieve anything, although both earned great merits in other areas, the one by successfully advocating the development of our economic interests in Australia and at the same time constantly pointing to southern Brazil as one of the most important settlement areas and also by giving the first impetus for the founding of the "German School Association", which later developed so powerfully, the Colonial Association, however, by spreading its ideas to ever wider circles, which were enterprising, rich and willing to sacrifice enough to steer Germany's first colonial acquisition, which was received with great enthusiasm from all sides, onto a secure course after its energetic founder, Mr. August Lüderitz, was no longer able to continue it from his own resources. As extremely gratifying as these successes were, especially for those who had hoped in vain for decades for the realization of their patriotic dreams, they still did not seem satisfactory to many, and at the suggestion of Dr. Karl Peters a "Party of That" was formed, which found strong support from another political direction. Inspired by von der Decken's reports, Dr. Peters set out soon after the founding of the Society for German Colonization with Joachim *) The late editor Franz Maurer and the current city councillor Ernst Friedel.

Count Pfeil and some other enterprising young men to East Africa, and after a very short time the news spread throughout Europe, initially received with disbelief and even derision by many, that large territorial acquisitions had been made there for Germany. Fortunately, Prince Bismarck resolutely supported Peters' treaties; for their sake, he even sacrificed valuable offers from southern Africa, which was better situated in many respects, and thus the foundation was laid for our now most important overseas possessions, which Dr. Peters and his comrades attempted to extend ever further northwards by means of new treaties. Around the same time, Clemens Denhardt, the elder of the two brothers, had also succeeded in persuading the Sultan of Witu to place his land under German protection and cede about 25 square miles of it for the establishment of a German settlement. Prince Bismarck also accepted this offer and later, as is generally known, extended German protection as far as the Djuba River, so that it was hoped that von der Decken's patriotic plans would be realized in an unexpectedly brilliant manner despite the long time that had passed since the traveller's death. How bitter the disappointment was when all this was destroyed with the stroke of a pen does not need to be discussed in detail here. It will, however, be instructive to briefly point out how many a person, who had to wait for the painful realization of their dreams as a result of the disastrous Anglo-German treaty of 1 July 1890, was disappointed. July 1, 1890, has done his best to bring about this result through unfortunate jealousies, and how England would hardly have been in a position to cast its covetous eyes on the hard-won territory of Deckens without some flaws in the German national character, which have made themselves felt in such a nasty way in the short history of our northern East African possessions, Soon after Denhardt's fortunate acquisition of the Witu area, difficulties arose due to the competition, or rather the jealousy of other pioneers of German colonization in East Africa, who completely forgot that Witu had already become German and then wasted considerable amounts of energy and money in order to win over the Sultan of Witu, who, however, stuck to his word with remarkable loyalty. If it was regrettable that such rich resources were not used for a better purpose, it must be described as downright deplorable that two groups of Germans, each of whom thought they were serving the fatherland, gave the Arabs and natives the disgusting spectacle of disunity and working against each other. The consequence of this was that, on the occasion of the demarcation of the coastal area, the Sultan of Witu was given the islands of Manda. Kwein and Pata, the latter the ancestral land of his ancestors, were not granted to the Sultan of Witu, and accordingly, as the Sultan of Zanzibar had no claim to them, the right to possess them remained open; the final result was that the whole of Wituland was finally given to England, because without the islands in question, which could so easily have been secured earlier, it would have been of no great value to us! It is not the place here to examine who did the most wrong in these miserable quarrels, but it seemed to me necessary to point out that the old proverb of consuming discord is of terrible truth even in colonial or overseas undertakings, and that our landlords abroad, if their fatherland is dear to them at all, should stand together faithfully under all circumstances and leave aside all jealousies where patriotic interests are in question. Without similar fault on the part of our pioneers, the northern part of the exploration area of the Deckens was lost to us, which still lives in everyone's memory, and unfortunately there is no hope that even the smallest part of the rich Djubaland, which the traveler opened up with such great sacrifices, could ever be regained for Germany. Even if the piece of East African land that is still left to us is still considerable enough to offer scope for many useful undertakings, every friend of the fatherland who knows even a little about the history of the discovery of those territories will be deeply saddened for all time when he thinks of the impious way in which they were abandoned. It is more pleasing to look back on the development of East Africa as a whole since the times of von der Decken. When the enterprising traveler came to Zanzibar at the beginning of the sixties, only sailing ships were available for the then already very developed traffic with this rich island, which reached their destination on a journey of almost a hundred days around the Kay of Good Hope. It was only later that the Suez Canal was opened, and even then for many years there was still no direct steamship connection to Zanzibar, and anyone who did not want to sail from Bombay to Zanzibar on a Dan at the time of the favorable monsoon had to first sail to the group of islets about 1000 nautical miles to the east, from where there were frequent opportunities to reach Zanzibar on a small English steamer. Gradually, however, steamship traffic through the Suez Canal, as well as around the Cape of Good Hope and via Mozambique, developed in a magnificent manner; later an Oewald steamer also provided direct German traffic and finally the subsidized German steamer line was established, which will have taken up its full service within a few months. Soon after von der Decken's death, numerous, often very strong caravans were equipped to explore the then still little-known interior in more detail or to provide newly established observation and missionary stations there with what they needed. Now, reasonably good roads have already been built in several places to connect some important points, and within a short time, what was so often ridiculed as a fantasy of the venerable Dr. Krapf will have become a reality: the construction of railroads to Kilimanjaro and the lake region! Likewise, it will not be long before steamers will also be floating on Lake Ukerewe and Lake Tanganyika, despite the considerable difficulties of transportation, just as they have long been sailing through Lake Nyassa, and thanks to the energetic efforts of Major v. Wißmann, the German flag will not be unrepresented. Anyone who can thus compare the old conditions in von der Decken's time with the cheerful development now will, despite all the pain that many a beautiful hope has been destroyed, look to the future with joyful expectation and can at least say with some satisfaction that the impulses which our explorer has given through his courageous action have not been completely lost. The scientific impulses which have been brought about by von der Decken's travels and by the publication of the collections and observations made by him and his companions can also be regarded as quite gratifying. The greatest gain has been made in the ornithology of East Africa, which has been extraordinarily promoted by German researchers on the basis of Hartlaub-Finsch's meritorious work "Die Vögel Ostafrikas" (The Birds of East Africa), and of the scientific institutes in Germany the Berlin Zoological Museum has received the most contributions from the rich collections of travelers such as Pr. Böhm, Dr. Fischer and others, so that it can now be regarded as the best equipped in this respect. In other scientific fields, however, a little more could have been done, and it can therefore be expected that, once our East African colony has settled down, research that has been somewhat neglected up to now, such as surveying and meteorological observations, will be resumed with zeal. To complete the review of von der Decken's work, I would like to point out a few traits that I already praised almost twenty years ago. The conclusion of my description at that time (cf. vol. 1I. p. 385) reads literally: "Above many other explorers, our baron distinguished himself by his clear, practical sense. Among other things, he offered to establish a trading and missionary station in the excellently situated Jaggaland, from which further ventures could be prepared as far as the region of the lakes; and that is why he attached so much importance to the exploration of the Djuba River. In his travels, it was less important to him to cover vast stretches of land than to make usable and record what had already been explored. He wanted to benefit his fatherland, especially German trade and commerce, through his efforts. Before 1866, however, his efforts were not understood in the relevant circles, so that he could only achieve the merit of having sacrificed everything for a noble purpose; if he had been granted the opportunity to witness Germany's national rebirth, he would undoubtedly have completed what he had begun and realized his great ideas. This "faithful misfortune" also made him

Page 248

 for can there be anything more tragic for such a patriotic and self-sacrificing man than the almost magnificent ingratitude*) of his fatherland, for which he had sacrificed his best without a murmur? A full 25 years have passed since the death of this great pioneer of German colonization in East Africa without a single step having been taken to resume and complete his work! Who should still feel like following the shining example of von der Decken in the future? What he strived for and achieved has now been given away to a nation that has done the most harm to our colonial endeavors, and only one hope remains for the mourning companions of the deceased, that at least England, which knows how to honor its outstanding sons so well, may feel compelled to give the brave German explorer the well-deserved honor that his fatherland denied him *). The Küntzel case. The horror story of the murder of the planter Andreas Küntzel and seven or eight of his German companions in Witu, the town described by Küntzel in these pages*), in the midst of a population for which he had tried to arouse sympathy in Germany years ago, hits us like a hard blow, because it was not expected that there would ever be a dispute between Europeans and the Swahili in this area. Andreas Küntzel was, as we would like to point out at the outset, a personality with whom we did not like to deal in recent years, as some of his activities not only did not please us, but actually challenged us to criticize him. He was a Bavarian by birth, from Eppenreuth, first a teacher, then a farmer and forester, had been a foreign legionnaire in Algiers and Sumatra, had joined Dr. Peters in Aden, later the Denhardt brothers, and in the course of time wanted to have acquired tracts of land in Witu, for the cultivation of which he sought to raise funds. In 1886 he gave several lectures in southern Germany for the then German Colonial Association, but the association broke off all contact with him in the spring of 1887 and even warned the departments and private individuals against him, so that Küntzel had to look for the capitalists he needed for his ventures in other ways than in the circles of our society. At the end of 1889 he had returned to Germany and propagandized for a steam sawmill, with which he wanted to start working either in the only place in the primeval forest around the town of Witu on the Witu coast, where there might really still be valuable timber worth the cost of transport, or on one of the islands of Manda or Patta. However, he made such dangerous claims that the company considered it a duty to point out to a number of editors that Küntzel's statements were based on falsehood, especially since there were statements from people who had recently been injured by Küntzel in Africa,") in order to prevent greater damage. But there were still people who trusted Küntzel's information, so that he was able to lead a strong expedition from Hamburg to Lamu on the first Imperial mail steamer in July, which was joined in Antwerp by some German craftsmen and in Aden by the Somali interpreter Jamah bin Iussuf. Apart from the leader, the members of the expedition were as follows: Angust Meuschel, engineer, from Kitzingen, Fritz Häßter, doctor from Augoburg. Friedrich Stauff from Siegen, Johannes Clauß, carpenter, from Nijmwegen in Holland, Joseph Jazwicki, carpenter, from Szarley, Bromberg district, Joseph Drotleff from Hermannstadt in Transylvania, Karl Horn, baker, from Neustadt a. d. Haardt, Friy Horn. Schlosser, a locksmith, and Joseph Urban, a woodcutter, from Munich. They landed in Lamu with a lot of luggage. Küntzel soon got in touch with Sultan Fumo Bakari, whose army inspector he was accustomed to calling himself here, and on August 27 went to Witu City, following an invitation from the Sultan. *) Cf. "Overview of the Results" behind the preface to vol. III (also available as a copy of the broadcast) p. 2 and 8. *) For instance by naming the first Djuba steamer after the explorer of this promising waterway, if not his entire research territory, which so undeservedly fell to the English. should be called "Von der Decken=Land". The expedition of H. M. Krenzer's frigate "Gneisenau" to Achmed, the Sultan of Suabeli. By Andreas Küngel. Deutsche Kolonialzeitung issue 16, 1886 *) The Deutsche Kolonialzeitung took note of this in No. 1 of January 4, 1830.
In a last letter, sent on August 26, he wrote that his people had noticed the excellent behavior and conduct of the natives towards them, that the English consul in Lamu, Simons, had promised him every possible help and support - "a pleasant fact compared to the earlier drudgery of the Germans, and that Fumo Bakari, in view of the English agreement with the German Imperial Government 1)", was not on good terms with the Europeans, but had sent him a request to come to Witn soon. On September 15, he and his German companions were murdered. According to English reports, on which we are solely dependent here, Küntzel and his companions forced their way into the town after a dispute with the natives. When the Germans later wanted to leave the town and the natives tried to prevent this, they fired on the latter, who then attacked the Germans and killed eight. Later reports then established that the dispute had arisen over the right to cut wood in the Wituwald forest. It is said that the rescued man is the doctor. These are briefly the outlines of the sad story, which might not have taken place if our warnings had not fallen on barren ground. But we don't want to reproach anyone for this, because there can be different opinions about the economic basis for colonial ventures and our warnings were primarily directed in this direction. Küntzel possessed certain qualities which, in the eyes of those who had not studied the demands on colonizers in depth, made him appear to be the right man to carry out such difficult undertakings. Gifted with the necessary energy, he could certainly have achieved something here too, if only he had been more careful in his choice of means.*) We will refrain here from commenting on the possible guilt or innocence of the expedition members or the Negroes until precise information is available; we only want to point out that it must be in the interest of the Europeans active in East Africa that light be shed on this dark affair as soon as possible and that the guilty parties be punished. This would be more serious for the reputation of the Europeans than if the English were to let the matter fizzle out out of animosity towards the Germans or for political reasons in order to make the Sultan of Witu more agreeable. Strange stories, which we do not believe in for the time being, have recently come to us from the Witn region, according to which the official of the British East African Company entrusted with the takeover of Wituland is said to have offended German national sentiment in a sensitive manner. Should this news be confirmed, however, the eyes of the harmless people, who are still not cured of their Anglomania, would finally be opened and German national sentiment would certainly not be neglected. However, it should not only be left to the English government - and least of all to English society - to shed light on these sad circumstances; the German Reich must also take energetic steps to ensure that this dark deed, the gruesome conclusion of the latest German expedition in Witulande, is also completely impartially exposed and emphatically punished. Our government has all the more reason to take a firm stand in this matter vis-à-vis England, as it is reasonable to assume that the fate of Küntzel and his comrades is connected with the change in the Schuy rule over Witu brought about by the German-English agreement. With the protectorate over Witu, England not only assumed rights, but also obligations. The English government must be held responsible for ensuring that no injustice is done to German nationals in Witn, or at least that full punishment and compensation is paid for injustice done. In this respect, the exhibitions to which Küntzel's actions in Germany gave rise, and which we mentioned above, are of course irrelevant. Agricultural experiment stations in our colonies. By Dr. Richard Hindors. The creation of agricultural experimental stations in our colonies has already been discussed and recommended several times here and in other places. Nevertheless, if the 1) Küntzel had often managed to lose the favor of influential personalities through his handling of business matters. 2) Deutsche Kolonialzeitung 1885 p. 387 ff. (Soyaux.,

If the repeated suggestions have so far met with little success, the reason for this is certainly not to be found in the matter itself, but partly in the various difficulties that seem to stand in the way of the practical implementation of the proposals made, and especially in the unfortunately rather low level of active interest in colonial and related matters on the part of wide and influential circles. I use the expression "active participation" on purpose; perhaps one should not deny the circles concerned what is understood by the common word "interest". One reads "with interest" this or that report on events in our colonies, also on proposals and measures for their utilization, then puts the newspaper aside and no longer thinks about what one has read. But your conscience is at ease, because you have shown "interest" in our colonies. However, this does not sufficiently serve our colonial cause, and I call on all colonial friends to become even more actively involved in solving colonial tasks. Many times, hundreds of times, this appeal has been made to the German people, and it is gratifying to see that it has begun to make an impression; but it is necessary to sound the word again and again for our colonial endeavors, and to enlighten people about what we need, for only in this way will the German people soon become fully aware of their duties in the colonial field. What we have often lacked so far is the initiative that comes from broader sections of the population. The merchant class, the industrialists, the scholars, they should all do more than bioher to promote the efforts aimed at the all-round development of our colonies. And if these influential circles advocate vigorous action in the colonial field, big business, and above all the government, will be in a much better position than before to do something for the rapid economic utilization and development of our overseas possessions. What is the use of the many suggestions made by individuals, what is the use of all their best intentions and efforts, if the people who would be called upon to take up and disseminate the suggestions, to examine the proposals made and to support them if they are found to be good, always remain indifferent and refuse to help? I cannot spare the majority of our colonial-friendly daily press and many like-minded people the reproach that they pay far too little attention to the proposals in the field of colonial affairs that are made here and there in specialist journals, in lectures or in other places. Important colonial questions, like other matters of general economic importance, must be discussed in the widest possible circles, so that views on them can be clarified, and so that large sections of the population can then emphatically strive for what they consider to be good. But as with so many other colonial matters, so it has been with the proposals for the establishment of state tropical experimental stations: although they have aroused a certain amount of interest in the circles most closely involved, the idea has not been developed further or pursued to the point of practical implementation. However, this should not prevent us from returning to such questions again and again, because in the end, as has already been shown several times in the colonial field, such unflagging perseverance does lead to victory for the good cause. And so I undertake here again to point out the great importance of experimental stations for our colonies, especially for the dignified development of tropical agriculture there, to remind you once more of the services that such stations will render to science, and at the same time to sketch out the broad outlines of the plan for such stations. The fact that we need agricultural research stations in our overseas territories, whose greatest value and whose entire future, as is universally recognized, lies in the development of extensive tropical agriculture, could only be denied by someone who is not familiar with the needs of agriculture in general, nor with those of tropical agriculture and its Ebenda, 1887, p. 168 (Semler.) p. 298 ff. (Sovaux). p. 337 (von Philixpovich.) p. 481 (Hübbe=Schleiden.) 1890 p. 1. 3) Seyaux, Deutsche Arbeit in Afrika p. 78 fl. See also Reserat über Vortrag von Prof. Engler, D. Kolonialzeitung 1885, p. 695 f.
very inadequate training is known. But the fact that the English and Dutch, for example, have numerous such institutes and botanical gardens in their colonies, and that these are having the most beneficial effects everywhere, will probably speak even more in favor of agricultural experiment stations than any theoretical discussion.1) And if these experienced colonial peoples have such institutions in their overseas possessions, and are still continually extending and increasing them, we may well assume that they are appropriate and have proved their worth. It is to these experimental stations that English and Dutch India owe the introduction of the tea bush and the fever bark tree; at present their efforts are partly directed towards the more general introduction of the Liberiacassee, as well as towards determining the conditions for the profitable cultivation of caoutchouc-producing plants. Research into the foliage disease of coffee and the Sereh disease of sugar cane, and the search for effective means of combating them, now form an important part of the activities of many experimental stations; and the importance attached to such work by experienced tropical planters in other colonies, and the certainty with which they expect help from them, is shown by the fact that in many places in English and Dutch colonies new institutes of this kind are being set up at the instigation and largely at the expense of the planters, in order to get those pernicious plant diseases under control as soon as possible. Increasing rice cultivation, the introduction of new fiber plants and the production of its valuable fibers, higher utilization and at the same time conservation of forest resources, reforestation with valuable woods, these are just a few of the other areas in which many experimental stations have made great contributions. It would be going too far to go into detail about the varied and extremely fruitful activities of the many tropical experimental stations, botanical gardens, etc. Incidentally, we have tried and tested institutions of this kind in our own country, and just as our domestic agricultural research stations have had a transforming effect on our entire agricultural business, as they have been fruitful, stimulating and protective in many directions, thus benefiting the whole country, In the same way, and perhaps to an even greater extent, the experimental stations in our colonies will also be called upon and in a position to develop and improve tropical agriculture there, to support it when dangers arise, to show it new ways, and thus to be of service and benefit not only to the development of the colonies alone, but also retroactively to the mother country. However, there may be differences of opinion as to when and how such experimental stations should be set up, how and in which directions they should work, and especially who should take the creation of such stations into their own hands and bear the costs. I will discuss these individual points in more detail below. The purposes we are pursuing with these experimental stations are initially of a purely practical nature; their first task must be to serve the interests of agriculture in all directions; on the one hand, they should show the growers ways to achieve the highest possible economic yields through agriculture, and on the other hand, they should protect them as far as possible from failure. We must always keep this main task in mind, and it must be the determining factor in the selection of personalities for the management of such experimental stations, because the success of such facilities naturally depends first and foremost on the efficiency of the manager. The demands to be made on him are great and varied; for he must not only be a man with great scientific and practical agricultural knowledge and many years of experience in the tropics, but he must also know the agricultural and sales conditions of the most important tropical colonies, must have contact and contact with the agricultural circles there and with the experimental stations existing there, must also have a particularly wide range of commercial knowledge, so that he always remains informed about the needs of the world market and can take these needs into account by suggesting or even advising against them. It will be difficult to find many such people in Germany; but a considerable number of our compatriots have done such a good job abroad in similar or related positions and have proven themselves so well that we have a strong guarantee here that they will also be able to meet the demands placed on them as managers of our experimental stations 1) Compare: Warburg, Dr. O. Die öffentlichen Gärten (speziell die botanischen) in Britisch=Indien, Botanische Zeitung 1886, No. 46-49; also: "The Botanical Enterprise of tbe Empire", in the Proceodinge of the Roya Colonial Institute, Vol. 11.

 and some of them could probably be persuaded to work in German possessions. As far as the starting point for the establishment of such stations is concerned, there is no doubt that the sooner we proceed, the better. For just now, when we are beginning to set up agricultural operations in our colonies, so many questions concerning the selection of crops, the type of cultivation and operation to be adapted to local conditions, soil conditions, climate, etc., are waiting to be answered. Especially in the beginning, the first planters need so much advice based on local experience, especially in the first period it is so difficult to obtain good seed, especially now when starting out, well-managed experimental stations can prevent so many failures and ensure the success of the ventures by advising and helping, that we should not hesitate a moment longer with the establishment of such stations. There is no doubt that we will have them in our colonies, for agriculture cannot do without experimental stations and the help of science here, much less in the tropics, where it is much further back. So why, if we will sooner or later set up such facilities, let the best time pass, the time when they can be of infinite benefit and save our colonies and the planters there from heavy losses? After all, we have allowed several years to pass in which, if the call for agricultural experimental stations had been heeded at an early stage, the latter could have developed to such an extent that their fruitful activities would already be benefiting the new plantations; For the time being, each one is still to a certain extent an experiment whose outcome is uncertain, and it is understandable that it is not easy for anyone to want to carry out these experiments at their own expense and risk, so that private capital is initially reluctant to become heavily involved in planting. Under these circumstances, therefore, the creation of agricultural experiment stations is one of the most effective means of inducing German capitalists to establish more and more plantations in our colonies. And since it is agriculture, above all, that must elevate our colonies and make them valuable, we must do everything in our power to create agricultural experimental stations as soon as possible Of course, it will not be possible to set up large, fully equipped experimental stations with all the necessary equipment in the blink of an eye; Many facilities will only be built over the course of time when a need for them arises, and it will only be possible to fully expand such a station over time by adding one facility to another. However, the design for such stations should be as comprehensive as possible from the outset so that further expansion is easy in case of need, thus avoiding faulty facilities and unnecessary costs. The choice of a suitable site for the experimental station must be made with great care; it should of course be located in an area that is well suited for various tropical crops, the connection from there should be easy in all directions, and the given conditions in terms of soil composition, altitude, climate, etc. should be as varied as possible so that experiments in different directions are possible. Extensive cultivation trials should be carried out with the most important and most suitable tropical crops for the local conditions, as it will often be necessary, especially at the beginning, to prove through such extensive trial plantings whether the crops in question are worth growing there at all. Furthermore, all other tropical crops of some importance would then have to be planted, both to test how suitable they are for cultivation in the location in question and to be able to supply seeds and cuttings to the growers if required. In general, the procurement and distribution of seeds, seedlings, cuttings, tubers, etc., insofar as they cannot be easily obtained from the trade, will be an important task of the experimental stations. In the tropics it is much more difficult to procure good, fresh seed with a guarantee of authenticity than it is here, and the experimental stations must not shirk this task of procuring seed, at least where seed is otherwise difficult to obtain. This is particularly important when it comes to the introduction of completely new crops and new varieties; these must be tested with regard to their suitability for cultivation and their advantages, and if the results are favorable, it will be up to the experimental station to supply the growers with seeds on request. An important part of the agricultural trials will be the testing of new cultivation methods. It is precisely in this respect that tropical agriculture is still very behind, and there are still many worthwhile tasks to be solved. In many cases, people continue to work in the same way as they did in the past, or as previous generations learned from the natives, without thinking, and the method used could easily be replaced by a better one. The experimental stations can and must be active in this field and bring about change for the better; through their encouragement and example, crop production can be greatly improved. The influence of planting distance, cultivation and husbandry, fertilization, irrigation and drainage, shading, the age of the plants, the time of harvest, harvest preparation, etc. on the quantity, quality and value of the harvest must therefore be determined for a wide variety of crops; furthermore, the extent to which soil, climate, altitude, moisture conditions, etc. affect the growth of the plants and the yield of the harvest must be determined. For such observations, of course, a few vine stations are needed that are within easy reach of the main station; the latter would best be set up at an altitude of about 200 meters, where all palm trees and purely tropical plants thrive excellently; a vine station would perhaps be set up at an altitude of 600 to 810 meters, and a second station at an altitude of 1300 to 1600 meters, in order to carry out mountain crops with tropical and semi-tropical plants, as well as to cultivate European vegetables, potatoes, European fruit, etc. as far as possible. etc. as far as possible. In the tropics, the cultivation of forbs is very poor; even if it cannot be as important there as it is here, there is still much to improve in this area. The fact that we are still so far behind here is probably due to the fact that in the past, Europeans rarely engaged in livestock farming in the tropics. First of all, we have to focus our attention on finding good tropical pasture plants, of which we are still very poor; in order to reach our goal soon, Wagner's forage cultivation might be highly recommended, i.e. one looks for native grasses and forage herbs on the spot, which are readily eaten by cattle and which are suitable for pasture according to their occurrence and growth, collects their seeds and sows them in order to achieve a pasture adapted to the local conditions. Incidentally, in other tropical colonies, especially in Queensland, the task of seeking out better tropical fodder plants and especially pasture grasses has been undertaken with much zeal and also with success, and seeds of such plants are being brought onto the market; but there is still a wide field of work open for our experimental stations. The plant cultivation trials must now be followed by animal breeding and husbandry trials. We will first have to turn our attention to the domestic animals and must try to improve the existing breeds and make them more efficient through purposeful breeding and good husbandry; it will then generally be advisable to carry out introductory trials with other proven breeds and also to cross these with the domestic animals in order to obtain the most useful animals possible by combining or potentiating good characteristics. I would particularly like to recommend feeding experiments; as a rule, however, in the tropics the animals are left to find their own food under all circumstances, and one often hears the opinion expressed that livestock breeding is not worthwhile in the tropics if the animals are fed specially; However, I know from my own extensive experience that not only for riding horses and other working animals, but also for dairy and fattening animals, as well as for rearing, an appropriate and rich diet is very beneficial and often works almost miracles. Finally, the experimental stations might have to deal with the introduction of new branches of animal husbandry, e.g. ostrich breeding. In addition to such practical activities of the stations, scientific or scientifically practical auxiliary work is of the greatest importance for the development and improvement of agriculture in our colonies; we need the help of science to a great extent, which must place itself fully at the service of practice. First of all, I would like to mention the establishment of comprehensive metcorological observations. It is true that we already have extremely valuable records of this kind from our colonies, and they will probably be continued by various parties; for only through very numerous and regular observations over many years can we obtain a picture of the weather conditions in our colonies that clearly shows both the regular course and unusual fluctuations. But we will not be able to do without permanent and well-organized observation stations; and since, on the one hand, the determination of weather conditions for agriculture in general and

Page 251

Since meteorological observations are of the greatest importance for the experimental stations themselves, and on the other hand it is precisely at such institutes that the possibility for the most accurate and regular work is given, the most careful meteorological observations must be one of the main tasks of the experimental stations. However, the latter route also entails so many inconveniences, and in particular the great loss of time is so disruptive, that support of the practice by science from Europe must be considered quite inadequate. If it is impossible in the long run to have all investigations and evaluations of soil, fertilizers, crops, bush and mining products, etc. carried out in Germany, then, for example, the very necessary seed control and especially the observation and investigation of the many very harmful plant diseases, possibly also of animal diseases, as well as the discovery of effective pesticides, can only be carried out satisfactorily on the spot. For comparative assessment and for general information, sample collections of all agricultural products, wood and so-called bush products, partly raw and partly ready for the market, should be set up, as is done everywhere by such institutes in other colonies. The research results obtained from the experimental stations must now be made available to our colonies to the greatest possible extent. For this purpose, frequent and good publications must be made in Togeo newspapers, trade journals or in special publications, which make the experience gained accessible to our new settlers, so that in this way their cultivation methods and varieties are introduced, so that the grower learns how to protect himself against pests, so that he becomes aware of new sales areas or receives inspiration to try out new branches of industry. The experimental station must pay particular attention to this aspect, that it is called upon to take the initiative everywhere in the agricultural field; the individual grower is rarely in a position to try out costly and as yet untested innovations. This will be a matter for the experimental stations; but it is then also their task to ensure that we do not stop at mere experiments, but that what has been tested can also be put to beneficial use in practice. I would like to briefly mention one area in which the experimental stations in the tropics can create a great deal of usefulness through stimulation and example: the widest possible use of labor-saving devices and machines in agriculture. Their use in other colonies has so far been conspicuously limited. But since we have to compete with already highly developed tropical countries with cheap human labor, and since we do not exactly have an abundance of human hands in our possessions, the German colonies in particular will have to switch to the most extensive use of agricultural machinery in a short time, and thus at the same time open up a new field of activity for domestic industry, and the experimental stations must help to ensure that this happens easily and on a large scale. The various experimental stations in our colonies will now have to enter into active contact with each other, as well as with similar institutions in Germany and with botanical gardens, and establish a lively exchange of experience and of observation and working material. With regard to such an organization, we can learn a lot from the English. The numerous botanical gardens and related institutions in all British possessions are closely connected with the large botanical garden in Kew near London. This is the collection point for all observations and experiences in the field of botany, plant cultivation and the utilization of plant products; here is the clearinghouse, the great exchange where all these experiences are exchanged, from where they are passed on to all English possessions.*) From there, all plant material finds the fastest and widest distribution, to be tried wherever the Andau may be worthwhile. And so these Royal Gardens at Kew, in conjunction with the numerous dotanic gardens that exist throughout the vast English empire, serve in the grandest way to promote the agricultural interests of all the English possessions. But in addition to these practical purposes, these dotanic gardens at Kew and in the colonies naturally also pursue scientific aims. And if we may add to*) The Botanical Enterprise of the Empire, op. cit. p. 278.
The Botanical Enterprise of the Empire, l.c. p. 277, we are placing the greatest emphasis on the practical side of our experimental stations in the colonies, but this does not exclude the possibility that they may also serve pure science. These stations will have a laboratory for chemical analyses, for plant and animal physiological studies, for microscopic work, etc., there will be scientific instruments and a library, and here the botanist, the zoologist, and other researchers will find an auxiliary apparatus that they will never have at their disposal in such completeness if they conduct research alone and without recourse to such stations in those as yet unexplored regions. Germany has done so much for the exploration of as yet unknown scientific areas, we have made such great sacrifices for ideal scientific purposes that it can be taken for granted that we are now prepared to do everything in the same way for the scientific exploration of our own overseas territories. After all, we have established that world-famous zoological station in Naples for the purposes of science and to honor the German name! The German people will be all the more willing to make further funds available for similar scientific research if this work is to contribute to opening up our own territories more and more. In order to make the experimental stations as useful as possible for science, workplaces for botany, zoology and other scientific fields must be set up at these stations, where our researchers can spend shorter or longer periods of time in peace and quiet, supported by all the aids of science. Until now, German researchers who wanted to carry out special studies on the spot in the tropics had to rely on themselves or on the hospitality of other nations. All these, and the whole scientific world in general, will welcome it with great pleasure if facilities are also set up in our colonies which serve to facilitate and promote scientific research in them; and I hope and appeal to all German friends of science, and especially to the specialists, that the efforts outlined here may be eagerly supported in word and deed. If the experimental stations to be established in our colonies are to serve such far-reaching and diverse interests, and if they are to work effectively and successfully in the long term, it is necessary for the state to take charge of their establishment and maintenance. Societies and individual private individuals, such as the East African Company, Woermann in West Africa, and above all the New Guinea Company, have established experimental plantations and observation stations in a highly commendable manner, or have spent considerable funds on scientific research in the areas concerned; but of course such undertakings cannot be extended as far and cannot be useful in as many different directions as is the case with state institutions of this kind. Experimental stations that are set up privately cannot benefit the general public as much; and yet this is of particular value in the beginning, they must be accessible to everyone and can be used by everyone. And because the experimental stations are called upon to promote the development of our colonies in general, and because they will ultimately also be of service to the mother country, I believe that the state will not be able to avoid the obligation to create such experimental stations in the long term. It will then be the task of later years to impose the costs for these stations, as indeed for all state facilities in the colonies, on the latter themselves. But as long as they are not yet in a position to bear such burdens, the mother country must lend a helping hand. If we leave the establishment of experimental stations to private initiative, not much will come of them. Only the state will be able to guarantee the necessary, and not insignificant, funds for a longer period of years, and only state experiment stations will be able to be organized in such a way that they really bring the benefits that are to be expected of them. Later, when we have extensive agriculture in our colonies, it will also be possible to call upon the agricultural districts to bear the costs of maintaining experimental stations; and in time, increasing revenues will also be obtained for chemical analyses and other kinds of investigations, and for seed and planting material, so that these will cover part of the costs. With the progressive expansion of agriculture in the colonies, the demands on the experimental stations will also increase and an increase in the latter will be necessary; but then

Page 252

 It will be appropriate to leave the establishment of new stations to the participating districts themselves; such more local experimental stations will naturally also be better able to adapt to the particular local needs, their field of work will not be so extensive, and they will therefore be able to devote all the more care to solving questions that are of particular importance for the region concerned. What we are striving for now is the creation by the government of one or more agricultural experimental stations, combined with workplaces for scientific research of various kinds, in our tropical colonies, in East and West Africa, and in New Guinea. Although in the past there was little prospect of such hopes being realized in the near future, it seems that the idea of government experiment stations has gradually gained wide currency in influential colonial circles, and it therefore seemed to me to be time to draw attention to this matter once again in order to give it a little more impetus, so that the sooner the better the hope of government experiment stations in our colonies may become a reality. Proceedings of the 25th Section for Medical Geography, Climatology and Tropical Hygiene at the 63rd Assembly of Natursorscher und Kerzte Vremen. Introductory chairman Dr. Oppel=Bremen, secretary Dr. U. Beyer=Bremen. The first constituent meeting took place on September 15, Monday afternoon at 4 o'clock under the direction of the chairman Dr. Oppel. It was decided that on the following day, Tuesday, the 16th, at 9 o'clock in the morning, a united meeting should take place, together with the 23rd Department of Hygiene and Medical Polisel. Mr. br. Oppel reported on the registered lectures and the expected responses to the questionnaires sent out by the previous year's Tropical Hygiene Section through the benevolent mediation of the German Colonial Society. In the second session, which was held under the direction of the Chairman, Dr. Oppel, in conjunction with the 23 Section, on Tuesday morning at 9 o'clock, Dr. Tisch. from Aburi on the Gold Coast, spoke about the prophylactic use of quinine and arsenic against malaria. This interesting lecture, which will be published in detail in the proceedings of the 63rd Assembly, introduced special bilious forms of fever and dealt therapeutically with prophylactic health measures, such as how fever can be avoided through the appropriate construction of houses in the tropics. The discussion was very detailed. Professors Dr. Gärtner=Jena, Fränkel-Königsberg and Löffler=Greifswald took part in it. The third session featured a lecture by Dr. E. Below=Mexico on "Averting epidemics can only be achieved through international hygiene measures (world hygiene). Following on from the request recently made by the Italian government to the Austrian government to form an international sanitary association, it was explained how, in view of these serious and energetic steps by governments, it must also be a matter for men of science, to no longer close their minds to this high obligation and to take account of the international aims of the Hogiene, which consisted in nothing less than the hygienic leadership in medical reform and public health for the purpose of the physical and spiritual ennoblement of the peoples and for the protection of the common enemy, the microbial world with all its harmfulness. At present, our international protection against epidemics consists of a very primitive international sanitary council, consisting of a few doctors in Kaire, Alexandria and Constantinople, who are paid by the port authorities there and whose main task is to supervise quarantine measures. it is necessary that at one of the international medical congresses, which are now beginning to be so numerously attended by the first scholars of all nations, a World Hygienic Association should be called into being The speaker will give details of the statutes and business of the association to be formed, which, if it could not be founded by the next international congress in accordance with the statutes, would have to be brought into being by a private meeting of the doctors and participants who are interested in it. A motivated written proposal by Dr. Below, which was read out at the international congress in Berlin by Privy Councillor Virchow, has already been submitted and the only thing left to do is to pass a resolution on it in Rome in 1893. Finally, reference is made to the far-reaching consequences of such a world hygiene association influencing the education, welfare and refinement of the people. The fourth meeting on Thursday, September 18 at " o'clock in the morning included a report on the responses received to the tropical hygiene questionnaires, which were presented by Dr. Below as follows: Gentlemen! I have been commissioned by the Chairman of this Section to report to the Department of Medical Geography, Climatology and Tropical Biology on the results of the responses received to the tropical hygiene questionnaires. The file material, which is presented to us in 5 impressive volumes, comprises in one volume the completion of the printed forms in English, German and French together with the corresponding correspondence; The three thinner volumes contain the addresses of the embassies and consulates in the various zones, which the Imperial Government helped to compile at the request of the German Colonial Society, and the fifth and longest volume contains the 23 questionnaire forms that have now been received and completed, together with the accompanying enclosures, British and Dutch annual reports of the various health offices of those governments in their prospective colonies, which provide very valuable medical statistics for the past few years To provide an orientation on the genesis of this work, which, as a brief perusal reveals, yields such abundant material of great importance, I am obliged to preface it with the following: The first stimulus to the idea of gaining a basis for joint international action in Bygienic matters through the regular collection of medical observations from the most diverse, especially from the tropical latitudes, was provided by Virchow's 1886 circular letter to the medical doctors of the tropics and the special issue published by the German Colonial Society with reports from the most diverse parts of the world on the health and hygienic conditions and on the alctimatization of Europeans there. This work was resumed in 1889 and continued in the form of scientific questionnaires, which the German Colonial Society was responsible for sending to doctors living in tropical countries. The committee of the board of this society set up a commission consisting of Professor lr. Schüller (Berlin), Dr. Bolemeyer, Secretary General of the German Colonial Society, and the speaker, which agreed on a sevenfold division of the sections of the questions; the first section dealt with localization, the second with topography together with fauna, flora and geology, as well as geographical peculiarities, the third section dealt with meteorological, the fourth with physiological, the fifth with pathological and bacterioscopic investigations. The sixth dealt with therapeutic data and the last, seventh, with sanitary and statistical data. As far as possible, all questions were posed in such a way that only numerical answers, only names, numbers and data had to be given. After Professors Virchow, Koch and Hirsch had had the great kindness to review the forms, which were written in three languages, and to correct and amend them here and there, 2000 copies of these improved forms were sent to various addresses in the provinces with the kind assistance of the Imperial Government, which in this way emphasized its great interest in this matter. It was intended that by July at the latest, the material received should be sifted through, systematically organized and published so that it could be presented by the German Colonial Society in separate booklets at the two congresses, as in 1886. However, the interim period had become somewhat too short, as the responses can only be received slowly. In many areas, as can now be assumed, the material for the replies will first have to be collected by the doctors asked to report. We can therefore expect many more responses. Mr. Redner now goes into more detail about the responses received so far, which relate to all parts of the earth and have already provided valuable material for processing. We can hand over these remarks today, as a detailed report on the entire material will be given later, as soon as the work on it has been completed. Dr. Oppel, as Chairman of the Section, thanked the speaker for his report, and at his request it was decided to present it to His Serene Highness the Prince of Hesse. Highness the Prince of Hobenlohe=Langendurg a letter of thanks on behalf of the Section for the rich cooperation rendered by the German Colonial Society for the benefit of tropical hygiene research. Bokemeyer, the Section decided to ask the President of the German Colonial Society to send a reminder to those who had failed to respond to the questionnaire as soon as possible, and to postpone the deadline until the spring of next year so that the material received could then be transferred to suitable staff for processing in due course. The selection of these experts and the determination of the rules to be established for the processing are reserved to the President of the German Colonial Society in conjunction with the Board of the Natural Researchers' Assembly, to which the processed material is to be transferred for next year's negotiations This concluded the deliberations on this subject, which is so important for the colonial circles, which in the main had the result that the Colonial Society will continue the work initiated in the interest of tropical hygiene science for another year. Krebs from Hamburg, who used a wealth of figures to demonstrate how a certain regularity is observed in the periodicity, extent and migration of the tropical and subtropical droughts, and that these droughts have a strong influence on the exports of certain countries, with which the Section concluded this year's proceedings.

News from the Society. The Committee of the German Colonial Society held its first meeting after the vacations under the chairmanship of Dr. Hammacher in the Society's offices on September 16. In his welcoming address to those present, the Chairman expressed the hope that the work of the Committee would be accompanied by the best success when it resumed after the vacation period and remembered the happy return of Dr. Peters, whom the Committee hoped to be able to welcome into its midst in the near future. From the discussion of the business proposals, it should be emphasized that the Committee approved in principle, in accordance with the President's proposals, the stationing of technicians at individual locations for the exploration of the colony of South West Africa. A start is to be made with the area north of the Orange River, initially on the estate of Stolzenfels and the surrounding area, the owner of which has agreed to accommodate and feed the representative of the Colonial Society for an indefinite period. His Serene Highness Prince Hohenlohe has telegraphically expressed his gratitude for the Grand Duke sent to him on the occasion of the dinner given at Edren Wißmann's in Bremen. On September 10, Prince Bismarck sent the following letter from Varzin to Senator Stadtländer: "Please accept my most sincere thanks for the friendly greeting sent to me by telegraph and express my gratitude to the gentlemen of the Colonial Society. (Sincerely) von Bismarck." Major von Wißmann has also expressed his warmest thanks in various letters for the honorable reception he received from the board of the exhibition and the people of Bremen, as well as his special appreciation of the successful Northwest German Exhibition. - Dr. Peters. The banquet held in honor of Dr. Karl Peters in Hanover on September 21 was attended by 200 participants. After the city director had given an enthusiastically received toast to the emperor, the Oberpräsident von Bennigsen lrr. Peters in a toast, which he returned with a toast to Mr. von Bennigsen after a very interesting speech about the course of the expedition. Government Councillor Launhard toasted the travel companions of Dr. Peters, Lieutenant von Tiedemann and Borchert; Lieutenant von Tiedemann expressed his thanks with a toast to the city of Hanover. Privy Councillor of Commerce Jänecke celebrated the former Minister of State von Hofmann. The latter saluted all supporters of the Peteröschen company. - The Adkeilung Berlin had organized a reception for Dr. Peters in the Philharmonie on 27 September. Professor von Cuny, as chairman of the department, presided over the event, as the honorary president, Prince Hohenlode=Langenburg, was unable to attend due to a necessary trip. He welcomed those present and reminded them that the German section of the Colonial Society was celebrating Major von Wißmann in Cologne at the same time. Minister of State von Hofmann recalled that two years ago His Majesty had expressed his warmest sympathies to the German Provisional Emin Pasha Committee. These sympathies have remained with him until recently and the award given to Dr. Peters proves that His Majesty did not dislike his diligence. We all look to the Emperor with loyalty and devotion and know that he has the will and strength to maintain and preserve the legacy of his ancestors. This also includes colonial policy. We could firmly trust that he would follow the right course in colonial policy as well as in domestic matters. The Emperor was saluted enthusiastically by the assembly. After the singing of the Usagara song, Professor von Cuny took the floor for the actual ceremonial address to Peters; he praised Carl Peters' stalwart, dutiful and courageous representation of the German cause in colonial politics. Over and above Wißmann's magnificent achievements, Dr. Peters' deeds retained their full national significance. Dr. Peters had refuted the accusation that the German colonial movement could do nothing without the protection of the Reich. Speaker lam referred to Peters' difficulties in talking to the English, praised his attitude, which had not left the legal ground, while the English had disdainfully violated the law. We have been indebted to England in colonial policy, we only had to hold on to the words of Dr. Peters, which he replied to Admiral Fremantle: I only vant my richt! Dr. Veters expressed the feelings of heartfelt joy that he was privileged to be among his friends on his 41st birthday. He had been in Oda Vorruruwa a year ago, when the mysterious land of the Masai people had appeared before him for the first time. At that time he had not thought that he would spend his next birthday with his friends, even if it was divine providence that had guided him through all the dangers. There had been much talk of the failure of the German Emin Pasha expedition. Although we had high hopes, he said, it was a success in itself that the expedition had not been trampled underfoot, but what we had achieved in Uganda was still of great importance, as we had gained some rights there that could perhaps be used if we remained true to ourselves. He had always had the feeling of being connected with the great aspects of the German national movement, the feeling of being aware of the steady progress of German nationhood and the German way. He concluded with a toast to the German Colonial Society, in particular to the Berlin section. An address from the Adteilung to Peters was then read out, in which Peters was celebrated as an acquirer of the German East African colony and as an explorer. Numerous telegrams had arrived from Prince Hohenlohe. Counts Arnim=Muskau (Miquel and Bennigsen have withdrawn) and many messages from the community and private individuals. Dr. Peters spoke movingly of the vow he had made to Germany, indeed to the whole world, to continue to promote the German nationalist idea. Major Liebert saluted Dr. Peters' companions (of whom Lieutenant v. Tiedemann was not present), comparing the African voyages of the Emin Pasha expedition with those of Ulysses, while Professor Schweinfurth celebrated Emin Pasha. Dr. Peters praised Prof. Schweinfurth as the most worthy African explorer, whose student he was proud to be called. There were then many witty speeches and counter-speeches, welcoming telegrams were read out and every now and then Dr. Peters was given a rousing ovation. The speech of Mr. Pros. Dr. Schweinfurtd read: "Today, as we celebrate the bold trailblazer in Africa, to whom the fatherland owes new and everlasting peace in the field of historical travel and who, through an example of eternal value, tested the ability of our race in the struggle against African nature, we cannot forget the man whose presence alone in the deepest heart of Africa was enough to fill Dr. C. Peters with the enthusiasm with which we saw him achieve such great things. Dr. Pelers had gone out to bring support to this man, the man who had taken under his care the last germs of European morality on the upper Nile, which alone remained in this immense area after the surrender of the Egyptian Sudan. This man was a German, and therefore he had to be helped. This man had done admirable things for the civilization of Africa, so his work had to be upheld. These were the reasons that were sufficient for Dr. Peters to undertake the venture in the face of all obstacles. Emin Pasha was the man who provided our Carl Peters with the reproach for his heroic deeds. We were not granted the opportunity to greet him either. Instead of joyful celebrations, his part is and remains the African wandering road with all its unbridled fatigue and the dangers that always threaten his health. Emin Pasha pays no attention to them. For him, restless labor is joy and pleasure, and he thinks little of his own efforts if only the fatherland profits from them. And that must be a great comfort to us if we are momentarily at a loss when faced with such an excess of renunciation and self-denial. This man with the historic Arab name and his well-deserved Aegpptian title of honor is no longer the German citizen of the world who uses his powers, for whose benefit and piety, for general human morality. Now Emin Pasha is no longer merely one of our own, he is ours alone; he is not merely our pride and our glory. His work is our gain, his life a piece of the German people's life "The building," Emin Pasha wrote to a friend (March 30, 1890), "which I have been building undauntedly for many years, has collapsed. The only thing to do now is to start again, but to choose more solid foundations. And that is what I am about to do. If I have worked and created for foreigners so far, I now want to use the time I have left for the best of my own country. A character of such a benevolent disposition is accompanied by qualities of personal kindness that make this rare man appear all the more admirable. There is only one voice among those who were privileged to be with Emin Pasha. Much has been said and written in glorification of this man, but no one has drawn so deeply from the wellsprings of human feeling as our revered Carl Peters when, in describing his final meeting with Emin Pasha, he concluded with the words: "It was the most beautiful day of my life and I must fear that I will not be granted the privilege of experiencing a more beautiful one. My esteemed comrades, I am sure of your approval when I ask you to empty your glass and dedicate it to the silent wanderer in the African wilderness, the pathfinder for German culture, the faithful servant of His Majesty our Most Gracious Lord and Emperor, Emin Pasha, long live (Wißmann=Kommers.) A commemoration in honor of the Reichskommissar Major v. Wißmann took place in the large hall of the Gürzenich on the 27th of this month. Councilor Langen opened the event by welcoming the Reichskommissar and the head of the East African protection force, Frörn. v. Gravenreuth. The Gonverneur of Cologne then proposed a toast to His Majesty the Emperor. President of the Higher Regional Court Struckmann toasted the Imperial Commissioner, he toasted the city of Cologne, senior teacher Domherr Hespers to Fr. von Gravenreuth and the latter to German unity and German national sentiment. Wißmann announced that not only had the construction of the steamer for the Viktoria Nyanza been secured, but that all preparations had already been made for its transportation from the coast to the sea. The steamer, which will cost between 70 and 80,000 marks, is to be transported inland packed in loads of up to 60 pounds. A contract has been concluded with the Jrlander Stokes, according to which he must be in Saadani on June 1, 1891 with 6000 Negroes from Wanvamwest to take over the transportation of the steamer. Mr. v. Wißmann is convinced that Germany will certainly beat England if everything is in Saadani by June 1st. Emin Pasha is to moor a harbor for the steamer at Lake Victoria Nyanza. From the southern end of the lake, the parts of the steamer would be brought to this harbor on boats and assembled there by European carpenters and shipbuilders. These people are already present at the construction of the steamer and have undertaken to go to Lake Victoria.

Page 254

Wood will be used as fuel for the steamer, just as the steamers on the Congo are equipped to use this fuel. The hard, gnarled wood of the savannah trees is extremely suitable for this purpose. The steamers for the Nyassa and Tanganvika would have to be transported by water over foreign territory. Lake Nyassa is only two days' journey by land, Langanyika two and twenty days. Mr. v. d. Heydt's proposal in Eiberfeld to build large sailing ships (galleys) for the inland lakes instead of steamers was rejected by Mr. v. Wißmann with the remark that sailing ships do not have the necessary speed to overtake the Arab dhows. The steamers would have to be seaworthy, as they would have to overcome heavy seas. A speed of at least eight knots was required. The collection organized at the banquet in Cologne for the benefit of the steamers yielded 30000 marks. - Bromberg Division. In honour of Lieutenant v. Tiedemann, the department had organized a banquet in the casino hall attended by about 100 gentlemen. Major v. Bredow=Schröttersdorf, the chairman of the department, raised the Emperor's head. Dr. Schmidt, a grammar school teacher, expressed his praise for Lieutenant von Tiedemann. The celebrated man expressed his thanks in warm, heartfelt words for the reception he had received in Berlin and Bromberg, and Mr. Regierungspräsident von Tiedemann, echoing the words of his son, expressed his heartfelt thanks for the sympathy that had been shown to him from the old sides on the occasion of the news of his son's alleged murder, and for the festive reception he had received on his return. - Wesel department. At its last meeting, the committee took note of the division established in Weiel with 50 members, whose board consists of the following gentlemen: 1st chairman: Gescher, Royal District Administrator of the district of Rees, 2nd chairman: Bauer, Mayor of Wesel. Secretary: Neewes, Prem.=Leut. d. Feld=Art.Reg. No. 7, treasurer Schmiedthals, bookseller. The committee expressed its thanks to these gentlemen, who have rendered outstanding services to the condition of the division. Black Forest Group. In Schwenningen, on August 24th, in the cellars of the "Bären" brewery, this year's well attended general meeting of the "Black Forest" group of the German Colonial Society was held. Dr. Neubaur gave an enthusiastically received lecture on the economic value of our East African protectorate. With the participation of the band of the Infantry Regiment No. 110 and the "Liederkranz" choral society, the celebration proceeded in the most dignified manner and tied a new firm bond around the numerous friends of the colonial cause, who had also gathered here from the surrounding towns. - Mr. Stadtrath Spielberg, the former member of the committee of our society, who was particularly concerned with the treatment of Beasilian matters (also in the German colonial newspaper), has died. The German Colonial Society will honor his memory with gratitude. Small announcements. - According to the "Reichsanz.", the necessary material on the future organization of the East African coastal area is being prepared within the Imperial administration so that a complete plan in all its details can be presented to the Imperial Diet when it convenes. The imperial governor in Cameroon, Freiderr von Soden, is currently on his way to East Africa to investigate and report on the future organization of the internal administration and the regulation of jurisdiction on the coast (Die deutsche Regierung und der Sklavenhandel in Ostafrika.) The Times, whose correspondent in Zanzibar has already hatched many cosonial-political canards, which have been accepted as true by our anti-colonial press with incredible indolence, reports from Zanzibar that the deputy German Reichskommissar in Bagamovo has issued a proclamation which permits the unhindered sale and purchase of slaves there as well as in the neighborhood. Only the export of slaves by sea was forbidden. The Uradians were also allowed to recapture runaway slaves. There was great joy among the Arabs in Bagamovo. The slaves of a recently deceased Arab slave trader had been publicly auctioned in Bagamoyo under the supervision of German officials and the Arabs firmly believed that the German administration had no objection to the slave trade and slave keeping. - This news, reported by the Times in the most cheerful and, for us Germans, most hurtful tone, was linked with threats that did not go unchallenged, so that a press feud existed, as in the times before the conclusion of the Anglo-German treaty. The most unpleasant aspect here was the sursisante Tan, with whom England wanted to interfere in relations that were actually of little concern, especially since instead of enforcing the Sultan's slave decree of August 1, the English actually brought masses of slaves to be used in East Africa in Sansidar and in the territory of the Third East African Company. The Times report on the alleged freeing of the slave trade in German East Africa was based on malicious fraud. The "Reichsanzeiger" published the following red shortly thereafter: "Immediately after the publication of the "Times" article of 15 d. M., according to which the Deputy Reicskommissar for Ostainka had declared the slave trade to have taken place by means of a proclamation, and that a public rally of slaves had taken place in Bagamovo with official participation, the Foreign Office demanded a report on the matter from the official in question. In a telegram received today, the deputy imperial commissioner from Sansidar reported that he had not issued such a proclamation, and that the news in the English papers was probably based on the mischief of an Arab; an investigation would be initiated immediately. That a slave auction had been held in Bagamoyo with the participation of an Arab was unthinkable. Dr. Schmidt will go to Bagamoyo without delay and report back from there." The position of the Imperial Government on the question was soon afterward made clear in the Reichsanzeiger by the following statements, which will satisfy all fair-minded people if one considers that even Cardinal Lavignerie had recently declared only the universal abolition of slavery to be possible: "Since Sultan Seppid Bargash, the commercial trade in slaves has been forbidden in the territory of the Sultanate of Zanzibar, under penalty of six months' imprisonment and subsequent deportation; on the other hand, it has remained permissible for a slave to be transferred from his master's property to that of another by purchase, gift or exchange. exchange, by testamentary disposition or by way of intestate succession. This legal situation has not yet been changed by the German administration in the coastal region; however, Sultan Seppid Ali decreed on August 1 of this year that any sale of a slave is now punishable by law and that ownership of a slave can only be transferred by inheritance to descendants. How deeply this decree would affect the living conditions of the entire population if it were actually implemented can be seen from the fact that the slaves for the most part also owned slaves themselves, over whom they had the same rights as a free man over his slaves. Furthermore, both in Sansidar and on the coast, it is customary for the slaves employed on a rural property to be considered as belonging to it and to be sold together with it; the prohibition of the sale of slaves would therefore be tantamount to the possible expropriation of landed property on the island by about 50 percent, and the people who have made advances against the pledging of slaves would lose the security for their debt claims. These new regulations have caused such a great commotion on the island of Zanzibar that they have not yet been implemented, and the Sultan has felt compelled to amend his earlier decree on 9 August of this year. Decrees issued by the Sultan of Zanzibar do not apply to the coastal area under German control; however, the German government, for its part, considered whether it would be appropriate to make similar provisions for that area with regard to domestic slave labor, as contained in the Sultan's decree of August 1. In agreement with the proposals of the Consul General in Zanzibar and the Deputy Imperial Commissioner, this question was answered in the negative for the reason that it seemed questionable, now that peace and order had been restored and the inhabitants were beginning to get used to the new conditions, to proceed abruptly with measures that would deeply interfere with the social and economic suspicions of the population and therefore harbor the danger of new upheavals and disturbances. Determined, as before, to oppose not only the slave trade but also the commercial slave trade vigorously and by all means, the German government reserves the right, in full compliance with the commitments made at the Brussels Conference, to choose the moment that it deems appropriate for further restrictions on the prevailing slavery; when the time comes, it will not only order the relevant measures, but will also ensure that they are strictly implemented. (East Africa) On August 5, the deputy Reichskommissar issued a command order concerning the importation and circulation of spirits. According to this order, the importation of schnapps in the entire occupied coastal area is only permitted with special authorization from the commandant's office. The sale and serving of schnapps by third parties on the coast is to be absolutely prohibited. All permits that may have been issued are to be withdrawn by the station chiefs as unjustified. No spirits may be sold in public: Wine. With regard to the demarcation of the various station districts, it has been determined that the entire coastal area is divided into two provinces, one north to Rusikji and one south from dert to Rovuma. The provinces are divided into the wards of Tang, Pangani, Saadani, Baoamoyo. Dar=esSalaam, station districts at the mouth of the Rusidji. No demarcations have yet been made for the southern station districts. - According to a compilation published in the Koloniaidlatt, the officers employed in the German Schutzkruppe have been assigned to the following stations since mid-August: Zanzibar. a) Command: Deputy Reichskommissar Che Dr. Schmidt; Arjtant: Leutnant Heymons. b) Administration Department: Büreauvorstind: Premier Lieutenant Donarsko. c) Serial Department: Board of Directors: Premierleutnant v.

(The Reichskommissar Major v. Wißmann) has concluded the construction of two demountable flat-bottomed expedition boats in Homburg with the shipyard of Janssen u. Schmilinsky A.=G. on Steinwärder, the completion of which is to take place as soon as possible. The construction of the two vessels intended for the exploration of African waters has already been started with increased manpower. The large boat, which is 50 feet long and 10 feet wide, is already in frames: work on the smaller vessel, which is 40' long, 6° 6" wide and only 3 feet deep, will begin in the next few days. Galvanized German steel will be used to build the craft. 23 parts make up the large boat, while the smaller one consists of only 13 sections. The maximum weight of the sections is set at around 200 pounds, as the transport of the vessels would take too much of the expedition's carrying personnel away if each section could not be carried by two people. The assembly of the boat is very simple and can be carried out even with the most primitive tools; the sections are put together, after a rubber packing has been placed between them, in such a way that the double-angled frames fit exactly into the holes used for inserting the screws; the firm tightening of the screw nuts achieves a perfect seal. Major v. Wißmann has expressed his appreciation to the builders for the three similar boats delivered two years ago when the expedition was equipped. Despite the almost daily use, no major repairs have been necessary up to now, and the loss of the rubber intermediate layers required for sealing has been compensated for by the use of old canvas nets, fiber bumpers, etc., without much water penetrating the boat. The boats, which were filled with 50-80 people, were even able to withstand the impact. The movement of the two-masted boats can be done by means of sails and oars; each boat has 12 pairs of the latter. - (Emin Pasha) hoisted the German flag in Tabora and continued his march to Usukuma. The action of the Germans on the coast did not fail to make the very independent Arabs of Jnnern more peaceful, so that Emin Pasha was able to occupy Tabora in peace with them. This important Arabian trading center, which was bypassed by both Stanley's and Peters' expeditions, has now been definitively transformed into a base of German power after the humiliation of Chief Sile, the ruler of Unyanvembe. This chief, who was completely in the hands of the Arabs, was nevertheless a very important person, as he had several hundred warriors at his disposal and lived in a reasonably solid building, a quikuru. Around these settlements, which can hold about 4-500 people, there are walls about 3-4 meters wide made of ledge and logs, which secure the settlements sufficiently for African suspicions. There are quite a number of such quikurus in Unyanyembe, so that their storming would have caused some difficulties. That this does not seem to have happened can be assumed from the telegram in which it is reported that Sike was forced to hand over his rifles, leg and 400 head of cattle. This chief Sile has come into contact with the Europeans many times, so that he is quite well known. Wißmann almost always calls him detrunken and schlafs. Reichard also describes him as treacherous and cruel, so that it seemed necessary to settle accounts with him definitively. His behavior towards Giesecke and Toeppen, who were completely isolated in Tabora, proves how much he depended on the Arabs, so that they had to retreat. The Arab murderer of Giesecke is now known to have been executed; if Sike was treated more lightly, he owes this to his relative benevolence towards the missions and his lesser power today, which was dealt a severe blow by a defeat at the hands of the fierce chief of Ugunda in 1888. Tivpu Tip was expected in Tabora at the time Emin Pasha moved in. If the Arab governor of the Falls Station of the Congo State is wise, he has discussed with Emin Pasha the chances of the lawsuit that Stanley has brought against him. - (Mr. Fritz Bley), who was formerly in the service of the German East African Society as head of the Agricultural Department, was elected director of the German Planters' Society, which is known to be active in Tanga, on September 17. The work on the Amboni tobacco plantation is prospering, about 300 workers are employed daily and the company certainly hopes to obtain a considerable and good tobacco harvest. The company's offices are located at Bülowstrasse 40 from October 1 - (Togogediet.) Dr. Wicke, the government physician for Togo, has published some information on the health conditions on the slave coast, from which it emerges that the climate there is not as bad as is often assumed. The disease rate of the 30 Europeans in 1888 was: 17 - 50.7 percent, in 1889: 26 - 86.7 percent including malaria with 23.6 and 34.7 percent respectively. Of the 17 people who fell ill in 1888, none died; of the 26 who fell ill, 1 died. 5 people who fell ill were sent to sea last year to recover. Klein=Poro has rather favorable conditions with regard to the recovery of the sick as well as from a hygienic point of view. It is noted that there can be no objection to the use of alcoholic beverages as long as they are consumed in moderation, as is generally the case in Togo. Alcoholic drinks are absolutely necessary for the sick and convalescents, as well as for people who have to endure heavy physical exertion, such as when traveling. - Dr. Büttner set off from Klein=Popo on July 4 after sending two caravans of 90 porters with an expedition of 36 people via Do Koffi to Bismarckburg. Lieutenant Herold has already undertaken various journeys from his station Misahöbe near Agome Tongbe to the areas of Kpandu and Kneja Go - (South West Africa.) A service directive concerning the exercise of judicial authority in the West African protectorate, which is based on the regulations for the other colonies, has been published in the Colonial Gazette. - Captain von Françols arrived in Wilhelmsfeste (Tsaobis) with the Schutztruppe on 1 Jali d. I Bergassessor. - Frielinghaus used a two-month leave to travel to the Transvaal goldfields. - The Imperial Consul Dr. Goering left Reboboth on June 29 to travel to the southern part of the protectorate - The German Colonial Society for Southwest Africa. The company's annual report for the fifth financial year from April 1, 1889 to March 31, 1890 states that the administration of the mining industry has been transferred to the imperial government and is now carried out by an administrative authority appointed by the latter, under the supervision of the imperial commissioner. On the other hand, the new decree recognizes that the company may freely exploit for itself those mining rights which it has acquired from native chiefs or their legal successors, and may also operate those parts of the territory which it owns itself or have them operated by others. The company is also guaranteed half of any surplus from the mining administration for use in the interests of the mining area. The economic situation in the mining area did not change significantly in the year under review. It has not yet been possible to determine whether there is any gold worth mining. The gold syndicate has stopped its work, the German-African Mining Company has resumed its work after a brief interruption. It is not impossible that further explorations will lead to the discovery of richer gold deposits. If this hope is realized, very considerable sums will have to be spent on a worthwhile mining operation, just as the natural constitution of the country means that its full economic development is dependent on extremely costly facilities and installations to improve transport conditions, water supply, etc.. The sums required for this purpose far exceed the funds available to the Company and, given the uncertainty of an early return, it cannot be expected, on the basis of all the experience gained to date, that it will be possible in the foreseeable future to attract sufficient German capital for use for economic purposes within our West African possessions. Under such circumstances, the Company could only welcome the opportunity that arose in the spring of 1889 to enter into negotiations for the sale of part of its possessions to a Dutch-English consortium. The conditions offered to the company opened up the prospect of an economic development of the conservation area undertaken with great capital and gave it the opportunity to develop a profitable activity here by using the purchase proceeds on the unsold part of its property. A corresponding agreement was therefore concluded with the approval of the Board of Directors. However, it was not executed because the legally required approval of the supervisory authority was not obtained. At the end of the financial year, the company's available assets amounted to 83,986.73 marks. (The Colonial Gazette published a very interesting article and map by Baninspektor F. A. Schran on the building activities in Cameroon, about which some information had already been provided in the article "Wanderungen in Kamerun" ("Wanderings in Cameroon"), from which it emerges that really significant work has been done here in recent years. The government building is built of bricks and rests on a high base. The floors are made of Mettlach slabs, the ceiling is made of corrugated iron and covered with a layer of cement concrete. The roof is made of wood with roofing felt. The Palaver=Halle was built of beech wood, which proved to be so weak that the whole building collapsed after a year and has not been renewed. The other houses were built in a very practical way with material from the company F. H. Schmidt in Altona, roads and paths laid out and gravelled, and the whole area of the governorate surrounded by a beautiful and friendly park. A start has also been made with the laying of bricks. In Victoria, a two-storey house has been built for the local district officer on the summit of a small mountain overlooking Victoria and Ambas Bay, and roads have been built to the cocoa plantation, Warship Bay and Bebundi. Further renovations and facilities are planned and urgently needed for both Victoria and Cameroon, in particular the construction of a villa colony for the sick and convalescents on the promontory between Warship Bay and Bimbia, where springs provide very good mineral water for the sick. In Cameroon itself, a fixed landing stage, a good beach path, a larger prison and, above all, a new, spacious office have become an irrefutable need. - Mr. Morgen, accompanied by a 120-strong trading caravan, started his return march from Kribi to the Jaundestation in May. From there he intends to undertake a new advance to the NE, into the headwaters of the Benus to Ngaundere and hopes to return to the coast at the end of the year. Jm Hindlick on the French incursions into our

In the hinterland, it would have been more advisable to advance from the Yaoundé station in an easterly direction in order to create perfect valley conditions here. Reichenow published a lengthy paper on the bird life in Cameroon in the 3rd issue (III. volume) of Mitteilungen aus den deutschen Schutzgebieten. - Some time ago the "Nordd. Allg. Zig." brought the later unconfirmed, but also undenied news of an extension of our Cameroon territory beyond Jola and the Benni to the Chadfee. It was replied that the English had already laid claim to this territory and that the Royal Niger Company - whose offense against the merchant Hönigsberg has still not been proven - had concluded contracts there. From more recent English reports, it is clear that they have endeavored to wrest the northern Adamana region from us and have sent several expeditions there for this purpose. There is already a report of one of them. The expedition went up a river that flows into the Benus near Ribago and made a very interesting geographical discovery. It is often claimed that at certain times of the year, a connection could be established between Lake Chad and the Bennö, using a tributary of the Shari. The Tuburi Swamp was, so to speak, the center of this water system, as it appears on all recent maps. The English expedition now sailed up this right tributary of the Benuö, called Kebbi, until it became so narrow that the small steamboat could no longer turn. Since the source must have been nearby, but the Tuburi swamp was still many miles away, it is clear that there was no connection. The natives were hostile to the Muhamedans. The area is described by the English as a rich and fertile alpine landscape. (The dispute between the Congo State and Portugal over Muata Pamwo is likely to remain in limbo for some time. Since the Portuguese cabinet had been in a state of dissolution for some time, it had not taken a definite position on the Congo government's proposal to submit the question to the Swiss Federal Council. - (The Paris Anti-Slavery Congress) opened in Paris on the 20th of this month under the presidency of Cardinal Laviguerie. As will be remembered, the Lucerne Congress of the previous year was abandoned because the Germans had the majority. In the interests of the cause, however, the German Catholics pushed back the not unjustified disgruntlement and took part in the Paris congress, where the French naturally had the majority. A number of resolutions were passed. One of these emphasized that the Congress was counting above all on peaceful means, especially the moral activity of the missionaries to raise the blacks, and that, if this had not yet been done, measures should be taken to eliminate the abuses in the recruitment of free Ardites and to secure the freedom of the blacks and the fulfilment of the treaties concluded with them. The Congress also expressed the wish that the support of these missions should enjoy freedom from customs duties. A resolution is original, according to which the Congress draws the attention of all powers, including the Muslim powers, to the danger that the development of certain African sects poses to the freedom of the blacks! The Muhammadan powers would care little about the progress of the Sennussites or related sects if it were only a matter of the slave trade. For as far as the Koranic faith extends, slavery is regarded as a perfectly legitimate legal institution. The Congress has also addressed to the signatory powers of the General Act of the Brussels Conference the expression of its deep appreciation of what it has accomplished, and expressed the wish that the last conditions still to be fulfilled should be complied with without delay, in order to do justice to the sentiments of the whole civilized world. As is well known, the Dutch Government did not sign the Anti-Slavery Act, prompted by the additional provision to the Brussels Treaty which allowed the Congo State to levy import duties. However, as a result of the Netherlands' non-accession, the agreements relating to the slave trade could not come into force either. - (The budget of the Netherlands=India) for 1891 shows expenditure of 136,800,000 fl. and income of 116,400,000 fl. and thus a deficit of 20,400,000 fl. which is to be covered by the surplus from previous financial years. The sale of cash is estimated at 190,000 picoles at 52 cents per half kilo, the coffee yield is assumed to be 15½ million fl. lower than in 1890. (From Matabeleland.) Further news has been received from the expedition of the British East African Company. From the river Umfuli, it has happily reached Mount Hampden, 40 miles away, where it is to be stationed. Rude reigned everywhere and trade was brisk. The missionaries and merchants returned to the country. The area traveled by the expedition is remarkably fertile and well-watered. The natives claim that the feather is unknown. The reception given to the pioneers by the Mashona and Makalaka in the populous region was excellent and it is generally believed that the land could be quickly transformed into a thriving farming colony if there were no fear of incursions by the Matabeles, which must always be a danger as long as the Matabeles' military system continues. According to the latest news, there was some agitation among the natives following the return of the Matabeles' envoy, who visited the Governor in Cape Town, to the King's Kraal in Umschete. (The English are not yet quite sure of their cause in Maiabeleland, for now and then fears appear in English papers that the Matabele king will only let the English into the country until the chances of an attack are more on his side than they are now, when the English still have communications to the south).
Literature. The Australian Handbook (Incorporating Nov Zealand, Fiji and Nev Guinea) Shippers' aud Importers Directory & Business Guide for 1890. (21st year.) Edited by Gordon & Gotsch. London, Melbourne, Sydney. Brisbane. Price 10 sh. 6 d. The editors introduced the first volume of this excellent reference work, which appeared in 1870, with the words: The numerous and varied relations between Great Britain and the Australian colonies, combined with the long felt need for a reliable reference book on Australia in general, in a compendious form and at a moderate price, have led to the publication of this little work. At that time the Handhook had 164 pages, now it has grown to 571 and is provided with numerous, excellently executed maps and plans, not counting the approx. 280 pages of advertisements, which are of no small value to the trading world. The book provides detailed and reliable information on all parts of Australia in every direction. Take, for example, the section on Queensland, which takes up pages 361-408. The introduction is a good map of the country and a tightly written, precisely dated historical sketch of the acquisition and subsequent administration of the colony. This is followed by a precise fixation of the borders, a description of the soil conditions, the administrative division, the climate, the flora and fauna, especially with regard to industrial use and commercial importance, the geo-logical, population and educational aspects. There are also articles on agriculture, the sugar industry, mining, postal and telegraph services (including a railroad map), horse railroads, road conditions, lighthouses, troop power, the factory industry, patents, breweries, savings banks, banking in general, immigration, and so on. There is also a list of government offices, insurance companies, banks, consuls, newspapers and an overview of customs and stamps. The whole is concluded by an alphabetical index of all the towns in Queensland. For each name there is a lot of information worth knowing. This part also includes a large plan of Brisdaue, a bird's eye view of Brisbane, an illustration of the Parliament Building, the National Bank Building, the Customs House, Victoria Bridge, the Palace of the Australian United Steam Navigation Company and the Queon Stroot. From this diversity one may draw the conclusion that the material used in the book is worthy of a stanza. Let us also add that the print, although very small, is admirably sharp and the rest of the design is exemplary. A. Seidel. W. J. Schmidt, Export=Hand=Adreßbuch von Deutschland 1890. first volume. Berlin, W. J. Schmidt u. Gelbrecht. 56. XXXII, 256, 329, 64. The meritorious founder of the export journal "Union" and the Deuischer Exportverein zu Berlin here offers the German export trade world an extremely valuable reference book. The second part of the rather handy volume contains an alphabetically arranged directory of German export companies with details of export specialties, export destinations, the agencies of the exporting companies and so on. This directory comprises 329 pages and also serves as the basis for a comprehensive 88-page "List of Sources of Supply" in German, French, English, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, Swedish, Danish, Russian and Japanese, which is placed at the front of the book. This is followed by a list of German consulates abroad with the most valuable statistical information on the following ten points: 1. lawyers, 2. banks for Jnkasso, and 3. booksellers in all important places, 4. importers, 5. newspapers that are read abroad, especially by Jimporters, 6. Export articles of all countries with export number, 7. import articles of all countries with import number, 8. weights, lengths, measures and hollow measures of all countries, 9. exchange stamps of trading countries, 10. further information for exporters, which is of particular value as it is based, like the other information, on data from the consulates concerned. An export directory also provides information on rail, steam and sailing ship connections, factory prices, travel times, departure and arrival times between the world's major cities and coastal areas, with special attention to German industrial centers. In addition, there is a comprehensive general customs tariff, a postal and dispatch tariff, and finally a list of foreign consulates in Germany, commission companies, agencies and forwarding agents. The varied content and the obvious care that the author has taken to provide reliable data make the book very valuable for our exporting industrialists. A. Seidel. Gonzenbach, L. von. Journey along the Nile. With 40 collotype plates, 203 illustrations in the text and many marginal vignettes by Rasaelo Mainella. 4°. 212 Deutsche Verlagsanstalt, Stuttgart 1890. In this magnificent work, the reader effortlessly takes part in the interesting journey of the author and the painter through the ancient wonderland of the pharaohs. Reading through the diary pages attentively, the reader encounters the folk tale with its historical background in its natural simplicity. The "Nile Voyage" on the "Sesostris", a comfortably furnished Dahabie, from Cairo to Philae and back is highly recommended to every friend of a stimulatingly written description of the Reije, and the excellent illustrations etc. make the work, which was published in a dignified edition, all the more valuable.

The collections for the steamships projected by Major v.

We therefore repeatedly ask our friends to work in their circles to ensure that German power gains a firm foothold on the Great Lakes as soon as possible: to suppress the slave trade, to benefit German trade and to secure our political reputation in East Africa.

St. When the German Empire embarked on an active colonial policy about six years ago, the Imperial Government, in accordance with the program repeatedly developed by Chancellor Prince Bismarck both in the Reichstag and in the various instructions addressed to representatives of the Empire abroad, intended to allow only the most modest use to be made of the forces and resources of the Empire for colonial ventures. Just as the acquisition and establishment of colonies was left to private initiative and activity from the outset, the government and administration of the territories "placed under the protection of the empire" was to be left to the colonial companies formed by the capitalists and trading houses involved, which were to exercise sovereign rights in their territories on the basis of Imperial Letters of Protection issued under the sovereignty of the empire by analogy with the English East India Company. It soon became apparent, however, that the Empire itself would have to take the administration of colonial affairs into its own hands to a much greater extent than originally intended, and that it was not possible to develop the German colonies along the lines of the territories acquired and governed by the English East India Company and the Dutch East India Trading Company, since the current economic and political conditions are quite different from those prevailing at the time when these two companies and their colonies came into being and flourished. Apart from the fact that the importance and power of the aforementioned trading companies was mainly based on jealously maintained trade monopolies, which are no longer possible today, much less was demanded and expected of the state about two centuries ago than is the case today. In particular, the protection of nationals and their property abroad was not regarded as a task of state administration to the same extent as it is today. In connection with this, the granting of this protection and the exercise of state sovereignty in colonies by trading companies used to contradict less the concept of the state's tasks.
In Cameroon and Togo, it was not at all possible to persuade the trading companies involved there to form a colonial company to be entrusted with local administration; instead, the imperial government had to have the administration handled by imperial officials from the outset. Although a colonial company was formed for South West Africa, which also acquired sovereign rights over some of the peoples in this area from the indigenous chiefs, the administration of the colony was not transferred to the company because it never requested a letter of protection. In particular, it was believed that it would be possible to permanently transfer the entire government and administration of its territory to the New Guinea Company, which was provided with an imperial letter of protection. However, after the New Guinea Company had established and managed the national administration as far as this was possible in the undeveloped conditions of the colony, such difficulties arose for the management of the administration by the company organs that the company, on the basis of a resolution passed on April 30th and approved by the highest court on May 17th, 1889, was forced to make a decision. The Company concluded an agreement with the Imperial Government on the basis of an amendment to the statutes adopted on April 30 and approved by the highest court on May 17, 1889, on the basis of which the national administration, including the administration of justice and the collection of taxes, customs duties, etc. based on the national sovereignty, was initially transferred to imperial officials for two years from October 1, 1889, while the costs of administration remained the responsibility of the New Guinea Company. In East Africa, the German East African Company, which had initially been granted sovereign rights for part of the territory it had acquired by imperial letter of protection dated February 27, 1885, was to manage the administration. It also began to establish various stations in its territory, which could serve both as bases for the economic development of the country and as a basis for the administrative organization. Furthermore, after the company had already obtained the customs administration and the right of joint use of the ports of Pangani and Dar es Salaam from the Sultan of Zanzibar by agreement of October 20, 1885, in return for a certain amount of rent, it succeeded in persuading the Sultan to conclude an agreement on April 28, 1888, under which he granted the company the entire administration of the ten nautical mile-wide coastal strip lying in front of the German acquisitions on a fifty-year lease, while retaining the sovereign rights to which he was entitled over this area. This agreement appeared to be suitable in every respect to promote the economic and political position of the company. However, when the administration of the territory was to be taken over by the Company's officials in implementation of this agreement, a general uprising broke out among the local population, especially the Arabs, as a result of which the Germans were expelled from almost all the places they had occupied. This uprising could only be dealt with by the intervention of the Reich, as the German=East African Company lacked the necessary power. It was therefore quite a

 The fact that the colonial societies are dependent on the help of the Reich at critical moments has provided striking proof that, now that the rebellion in East Africa has been suppressed, the possibility of peaceful cultural work has been restored there, but at the same time the German-English agreement of 1 July 1890 has brought Germany's colonial development to a certain conclusion insofar as the acquisition of further colonies is no longer being sought, the issue for the future is the internal organization and development of the acquired protectorates. In this respect, the question has now been raised as to whether it does not seem appropriate to convert the so-called company colonies into so-called crown colonies and to take over all protectorates into the direct administration of the empire. Various voices have spoken out in favor of the affirmative for all kinds of economic and political reasons. These reasons should not and cannot be discussed here, but it will be examined whether there are concerns of a constitutional nature that speak against the conversion of the Company Colonies into Crown Colonies and how this conversion can be initiated and put on the right track. Before going into the answers to these two questions, it seems appropriate, in order to avoid any misunderstandings, to make a few preliminary remarks regarding the meaning of the terms "Crown Colonies" and "Company Colonies" The terms "Crown Colonies" and "Company Colonies" were obviously created in imitation of the terminology commonly used in England. In England, the Crown Colonies are now contrasted with the Representative Colonies, which themselves are divided into Representative Colonies with Responsible Government and those without Responsible Government. The difference between the three types of colonies is based solely on the greater or lesser degree of independence they have in relation to the mother country. The representative colonies with responsible government have the greatest independence, since in them not only are the colonial laws enacted by a colonial representation of the people with the consent of the governor on the basis of the authorization granted to him by the Crown, but also the affairs of government are conducted by a colonial ministry politically responsible to the colonial people's representation and not under the control of the ministry of the mother country, whereas in crown colonies the government and administration are in the hands of the governor, who is bound by the instructions of the mother country's ministry, and the senior officials attached to him. The difference between the Crown Colonies and the Representative Colonies is not accidental, but is due to the nature of the circumstances. Only those colonies which have an exclusively or predominantly white population have attained the status of representative colonies, while crown colonies are those in which the population of European descent forms only a relatively small fraction of the total population. It is understandable that these colonies could not be granted as much political independence as those. In older English colonial law, however, the term "crown colonies" was used in a different sense, namely in contrast to the "proprietary colonies" and the "charter colonies". Proprietary colonies" were understood to be those which were governed and administered by the owners of the territory forming them on the basis of royal privilege; for example, Maryland was the property of the Earl of Baltimore, who also exercised governmental authority in it. Such colonies no longer exist today. On the other hand, there are still charter colonies, i.e. colonies that are administered by companies that are granted corporate rights and at the same time governmental powers over the territory they have acquired by royal charter. Such colonies are, for example, the Niger Protectorate, the territory of the British East African Company, North Bornco and so on. In contrast to proprietary colonies and chartered colonies, in England the term "crown colonies" used to refer to those that were governed and administered directly by royal officials. At present, however, the term "crown-colonies" is only used in the sense discussed above in contrast to representative colonies. In Germany, where there are no representative colonies, the comparison between "crown colonies" and "company colonies" is merely based on the usage of older English law, and the term "crown colonies" refers to those which are administered directly by imperial officials, while "company colonies" refers to those in which colonial companies exercise part of the sovereign rights ("protective power") to which the empire is entitled over the territories concerned on the basis of imperial letters of protection. To avoid any possible misunderstandings, however, it would be advisable to avoid the terms "crown colonies" and "company colonies" altogether and instead use the terms immediate and indirect protectorates. Moving on to the answer to the question of whether there are objections under constitutional law to the conversion of the indirect protectorates (company colonies) into direct protectorates (crown colonies), it should be noted above all that the German protectorates are not merely in a protectorate relationship with the German Empire under international law, but are subject to its sovereignty, so that the Empire is authorized to exercise state authority in the protectorates in its entire scope (legislation, jurisdiction and administration).*) Consequently, the constitution and administration of the protectorates may be regulated in any manner by Imperial law. This applies just as well to the Company Colonies as to the Crown Colonies. Even though all protectorates are equally subject to the sovereignty of the empire,*) they are nevertheless divided into two groups, as already indicated, insofar as in the so-called direct protectorates all sovereign rights are exercised by imperial officials, whereas in the indirect protectorates these sovereign rights are largely exercised by the organs of the colonial companies provided with imperial letters of protection. In the Imperial Law of 17 April 1886, concerning the legal relations of the German protectorates, the distinction of the protectorates into these two groups is not expressly mentioned, but in the amendment to this law of 15 March 1888, Article Il § 8, the transfer of the exercise of sovereign rights by imperial letters of protection is declared permissible; thus the distinction already existing earlier is also approved and tacitly recognized. Of the various colonial societies, only two have so far received imperial letters of protection. 1. the Deutsch=Ostafrikanische Gesellschaft received the letter of protection dated February 17, 1885 for its acquisitions made up to that date, 2. the New Guinea Company received the letter of protection dated May 17, 1885 with the supplement dated December 13, 1886 (concerning the islands of the Solomon group under German protection) for its entire territory. There are therefore only two indirect protectorates. The letter of protection dated 27 February 1885 states: "After the current chairmen of the Society for German Colonization .... requested our protection for the territorial acquisitions made by the Society in East Africa and presented us with the ... ... by which these territories have been ceded to the German Colonization Society with the rights of sovereignty, with the request that these territories be placed under Our sovereignty, we hereby confirm that We have accepted this sovereignty and placed the territories in question under Our protection. We confer upon the said company the power to exercise all rights flowing from the treaties submitted to Us. Similarly, the letter of protection of the New Guinea Company states: "In like manner we hereby confer upon the said Company ... the corresponding rights of sovereignty, together with the exclusive right to take possession of ownerless land in the protectorate and to dispose of it" and it has now been claimed (Joël, Pann),*) that these letters of protection have the same significance as protectorate treaties concluded between the empire and the colonial companies. However, this view is untenable for the simple reason that at the time the letters of protection were issued, the two colonial societies had not yet formed state communities from their territories with which the Empire could have concluded protectorate treaties. Similarly, Laband's*) view that the colonial societies and their territories were made into state communities under the "supreme state authority" of the Reich by these letters of protection cannot be accepted, since it is not at all clear what purpose the Reich should have pursued with such a creation and it must also be doubted that the Reich could have achieved such a purpose by issuing letters of protection. Rather, the constitutional significance of the letters of protection is merely *) Cf. Stengel, Die Deutschen Schutzgebiete p. 58 3) However, in the wide areas that have been left to the German sphere of interest by various international agreements, the Empire is not yet in a position to actually assert its sovereignty everywhere. 2) Stengel. die Schutzgebiete p. 105.

that the colonial companies concerned have been transferred by the imperial power, by way of unilateral conferral, a number of sovereign rights to which the empire is entitled over the protectorates and their inhabitants - the so-called sovereignty of the land - for exercise. The transfer was made only in terms of exercise, not in terms of substance, since modern constitutional law does not permit rights that form an integral part of state authority to be sold to private individuals or private companies. From this it also follows as a matter of course that the exercise takes place in the name of the empire which has "conferred" these rights. This applies not only to the sovereign rights over the Europeans, which the companies could not acquire from the chiefs because they did not possess such rights, but also to the sovereign rights over the natives, insofar as these were transferred to the companies by treaty, since these rights were transferred to the empire by the fact that the companies "placed themselves under the protection of the empire". With regard to the scope of the rights transferred to the companies, the right to represent the protectorates in international legal relations, and the foreign administration of the protectorates in general, was not transferred to the companies and could not be transferred to them at all, since the protectorates are part of the Reich under international law and must therefore be represented by the Reich authority in international legal relations, quite apart from the fact that it would not have been politically expedient to leave the foreign administration of the protectorates to the organs of colonial companies. It is true that only in the charter of the New Guinea Company was the management of the protectorate's foreign relations with foreign states expressly reserved to the imperial government, but this reservation is also self-evident for the East African Company. In fact, the Imperial Government has so far represented the territory of the East African Company in dealings under international law. Directly related to the representation of the protectorates under international law is the military protection of the protectorates against warlike attacks from outside. This protection is the responsibility of the empire and cannot be transferred to the colonial societies for general political reasons. A transfer of military sovereignty to the colonial societies is only possible and can only be assumed to have taken place insofar as it concerns the establishment of an armed force to maintain peace and security within the indirect protectorates. However, the Reich will also have to intervene for this purpose if the forces of the colonial society concerned are not sufficient, as happened in East Africa, while the transfer of foreign administration and military sovereignty was not possible for reasons of international law and general political considerations, the exercise of jurisdiction over members of the Reich and fellow protectors residing in the protectorates is precluded by the provision of § 2 of the Protectorates Act, according to which civil law, criminal law and judicial proceedings, including the judicial constitution, are governed for these persons by the provisions of the Reich Act of 10 July 1879 on Consular Courts. July 1879 on consular jurisdiction. Jurisdiction in the protectorates can therefore only be exercised by Imperial officials, insofar as the persons mentioned are in question. If jurisdiction is to be conferred on organs of the societies, this can only be done by express authorization of the Imperial Chancellor; the consequence of this, however, is that the organs of the society no longer act in this capacity, but as Imperial officials. Accordingly, the colonial societies could only be given jurisdiction over the natives and the Europeans and other persons who are not to be counted as members of the empire and fellow protectors. This was done in a general way in the charter of the German-East African Society, without, by the way, any regulation of this legal care having been made so far. In the letter of protection of the New Guinea Company, the administration of justice is expressly reserved to the Imperial Government. However, by imperial decree of July 7, 1888, the New Guinea Company was given jurisdiction over the natives of its territory until the end of 1897. The sovereignty granted to the colonial companies thus essentially comprises the administration of the interior, including police jurisdiction, and financial administration, including fiscal jurisdiction. Since the character of the indirect protectorates is based on the fact that the sovereign rights in question are not exercised by imperial officials in these territories, but by organs of the colonial companies, the indirect protectorates can only be converted into direct protectorates by withdrawing the sovereign rights granted to the companies. If the letters of protection had the meaning of treaties concluded between the empire and the colonial societies, it would be self-evident that the sovereign rights granted to the societies could only be withdrawn by the imperial government against their will for the same reasons for which a treaty can be unilaterally revoked by a party to the treaty. However, the transfer of sovereign rights to the colonial societies is based on a unilateral grant by the Emperor. Nevertheless, from this point of view too, it must be assumed that the rights granted to the societies cannot in and of themselves be unilaterally withdrawn. Whether the letters of protection are regarded as privileges or as concessions, the companies in any case acquired a subjective right to exercise the sovereign rights in question."). However, this right, like any other right, can of course be removed again by a provision of imperial law and there is therefore no legal obstacle to the conversion of the indirect protectorates into direct protectorates by imperial law. The situation is different, however, if the conversion is to take place by administrative means. In such a case, the revocation of the conferred powers can only take place for reasons arising from the content of the letters of protection themselves and the nature of these powers. It is important to note that, according to the content of the two letters of protection, the sovereign rights were granted to the companies under certain conditions to be fulfilled by them. Thus, the letter of protection of the East African Company states that the rights in question are granted on condition that the company remains a German company and that the members of the board of directors or other persons entrusted with the management of the company are members of the German Empire. Likewise, the New Guinea Company is granted the letter of protection on condition that it organizes its legal relations in accordance with German law within one year of the issuance of the letter of protection at the latest and that the members of its board of directors or the persons otherwise entrusted with its management are nationals of the German Reich. A further condition contained in this letter of protection is that the company fulfills the obligation it has entered into to provide the state institutions it has assumed and to pay the costs of adequate administration of justice. Accordingly, there can be no doubt that the sovereign rights conferred by the letters of protection can be withdrawn again if the express conditions contained in the letters of protection are not fulfilled. Since the colonial companies exercise sovereign rights in the protectorate on the basis of the letters of protection, but the exercise of sovereign powers by other than state organs can only take place under the supervision of the state in order to avoid an unlawful and abusive use of the powers conferred and to prevent damage to public interests, the letters of protection expressly reserve the right of the Imperial Government to supervise the colonial companies with regard to the exercise of the sovereign rights conferred on them. The way in which this supervision is to be exercised is not specified in the letters of protection; the Imperial Government therefore has a free hand in this respect. Accordingly, at the end of the letter of protection of the German-East African Society it states that the exercise of the sovereign rights in question is granted to the Society "under the supervision of Our Government and subject to further orders and additions to be issued by Us to this letter of protection". The Letter of Protection of the New Guinea Company expresses itself more precisely and more definitely by stating: "Subject to subsequent amendments to this Letter of Protection of Ours and to the provisions to be issued by Our Government for its execution as well as to the further orders to be made in the exercise of Our sovereignty over the protectorate, which the Company is obliged to comply with in the event of loss of the claim to Our protection. This latter provision also specifies the means of coercion that can be used against a company in extreme cases. In the letter of protection of the German East African Company, however, no mention is made of this means of coercion, but it must be regarded as quite self-evident that the Imperial Government has the right to impose sanctions on a colonial company which disobeys and resists its supervisory orders, abuses the sovereign rights it has been granted, harms the interests of the Empire, or *) Cf. the articles "Konzessionen" and "Privilegium" in the Dictionary of German Administrative Law.

 proves incapable of exercising the rights conferred, to withdraw their protection, i.e. to take back these sovereign rights and make the territory a direct one. Apart from these two cases of the withdrawal of sovereign rights by way of superintendence or due to judicial fulfillment of the conditions contained in the letters of protection, withdrawal by administrative means does not appear to be permissible. Rather, it is always necessary for the Company to renounce the exercise of the rights conferred on it. The Imperial Government evidently also proceeded from this point of view in the agreement it concluded with the New Guinea Company, the content of which stipulates that from October 1, 1889, the national administration in the territory of the Company, including the administration of rights and the collection of taxes and customs duties based on the sovereignty of the country, etc., will be managed by imperial officials for a provisional period of two years. By concluding such an agreement, the Imperial Government tacitly recognized that the Company had a right to exercise sovereignty over the land. It should be noted that in this agreement of May 3, 1889, the Company's exclusive right to land to the extent specified in the imperial letter of protection was preserved in addition to the commercial privileges secured to it by previous legislation. This will also be possible with the complete conversion of the territory of the New Guinea Company into a direct protectorate, since this conversion only involves the assumption of the exercise of the essential sovereign rights by the Empire, while the powers of the Company not belonging to these rights can and for a number of reasons must be left as they are. According to the foregoing, the conversion of the two company colonies, the German East African Company and the New Guinea Company, into direct protectorates by administrative means is, however, objectionable under state law insofar as the companies have a right to exercise the sovereign rights granted to them, which can only be withdrawn from them under certain conditions. On the other hand, there is no legal obstacle to conversion by Imperial Law. Whether such a conversion is justified by political reasons is not to be examined here. Only the one remark may be permitted that in the event of conversion, no compensation will have to be granted to the companies for the sovereign rights withdrawn, since these are not usable rights, but powers whose exercise initially only causes costs for the companies. On the other hand, it will also be equitable to relieve the companies of the obligation to bear the costs of the state facilities. The following are regarded as indirect protectorates: 1. the territory of the New Guinea Company, 2. that part of the territory of the German East African Company to which the letter of protection of February 27, 1885 refers. However, through the treaties it concluded with various sultans and chiefs, the German East African Company acquired a much larger territory than that mentioned in the letter of protection. Of these acquisitions, however, only those which fall within the German sphere of interest as defined by the two German-English agreements of October/November 1886 and July 1, 1890 come into consideration. All other acquisitions by the German East African Company were either not recognized by the Reich or, like the coast from the northern border of Witu to Kismayn, were given up again. As far as the Wituland itself is concerned, the rights to which the Witngesellschaft was entitled in relation to this area have been transferred to the German East African Company as the legal successor to the Witugesellschaft. However, since the Empire renounced its powers in relation to Witu in favor of England in the Convention of July 1, 18.0, Wituland does not come into further consideration here. Similarly, no further investigation can be made here as to the position of the German East African Company vis-à-vis the English government with regard to the sovereign rights and private rights acquired by the Witu Company. Even if the territory of the East African Company tacitly recognized by the Imperial Government in the manner indicated is much more important than that to which the letter of protection of 27 February 1885 refers, this letter of protection has not yet been extended to the Company's later acquisitions. The consequence of this is that, although the Company is in possession of the sovereign rights over the indigenous peoples which were transferred to it by the acquisition treaties, it cannot exercise any sovereign rights over the Danzig members of the Empire or over other Europeans, since, according to the principles of international law, the tribesmen and sultans of uncivilized tribes are not entitled to such sovereign rights. The German Imperial Government therefore has it in its hands whether it wishes to grant the German East African Society sovereign rights over the territories in question and the Europeans in them by means of a letter of protection. If it does not do so, and it probably has no sufficient reason to do so, then these territories remain direct protectorates in which the Imperial Government has state authority exercised by imperial officials. It is obvious that this would lead to complicated relations. Perhaps this gives all the more reason to convert the East African protectorate into a "crown colony" in the first place As far as the second question is concerned, how a conversion of the company colonies into crown colonies can be initiated and initiated in the right way, this question has essentially already been answered above. It has been pointed out that the conversion can be effected: 1. by Imperial law; 2. by administrative means; 3. by agreement between the Imperial Government and the companies concerned. Since a Reich law will hardly be passed for this purpose, and the withdrawal of sovereign rights by administrative means is only permissible under special conditions, the conversion will have to be carried out by agreement, as has already been done with the New Guinea Company. The fact that the ReuGuinea Company is willing to renounce the exercise of the sovereign rights granted to it should be proven by the agreement of May 23, 1889. In view of the events that have taken place in East Africa over the last two years, the German East African Company should also be persuaded to relinquish the sovereign rights granted to it by the Letter of Protection, as this exercise is associated with great costs and difficulties, If the conversion of the indirect protectorates into direct protectorates takes place in one way or another, it is a matter, as has already been emphasized, of the exercise of the sovereign rights conferred on the colonial societies being transferred back to the Empire, which then has these rights exercised by Imperial officials. As also already indicated, this can only concern the essential sovereign rights, such as police power, financial power, etc., while there is no objection to other rights, such as the land acquisition monopoly, being transferred to the companies. The conversion of the German East African Company will pose a difficulty in that the Company has leased the administration of the mainland possessions under the Sultan's sovereignty from the Sultan of Zanzibar for fifty years under a contract dated April 28, 1888. As a result of this contract, the company acquires the right to exercise the public authority to which the Sultan is entitled over these territories in his name and under his flag, while preserving his sovereign rights. As is well known, according to the German-English agreement of July 1, 1890, the Sultan of Zanzibar is to be induced, through the mediation of England, to cede all sovereign rights over his possessions on the mainland to the German Empire in return for compensation. If, as is not to be doubted, this cession takes place, the Reich will appear as the legal successor of the Sultan of Zanzibar vis-à-vis the German East African Company with regard to the treaty of April 28, 1888. It is self-evident that the Empire will respect the rights acquired by the Company under the treaty, especially since the main purpose of the Company in concluding the treaty was to obtain financial benefits from the customs duties, the collection of which was essentially limited to the administration of the territory concerned. On the other hand, it is in the nature of things that the transfer of the Sultan's sovereign rights to the Empire will substantially change the situation and that, if East Africa is transformed into a Crown Colony, the exercise of public authority in the coastal area can least of all be left to the German East African Company, In these circumstances, a way out that takes account of the interests of both the Company and the Empire might be to leave the collection of the customs duties that have hitherto been in use to the Company for its own account, while the other sovereign rights are exercised by the Empire. This solution could be adopted without hesitation, particularly because customs administration does not have to be regarded as an essential sovereign right under the conditions that exist in East Africa. On the other hand, the Company will have to contribute to the payment of the compensation to be paid to the Sultan of Zanzibar and at least to the partial bearing of the administrative costs of the route in question.

The Swastland Convention. Shortly after the conclusion of the German-English agreement, the fate of Transvaal was also fulfilled and the diplomacy of the English won a victory over that of the Boers, which was painfully felt throughout the Trausvaal Republic. As is well known, after the death of the King of Swafiland, disputes had broken out between the Boers and the English, as the former claimed to have the next legal claim to the land. For it was not the English but the Transvaalers who had once overcome Dingaan, the enemy of Swazis and the strangler of entire tribes, and in return had received a promise from the Swazis that they would be the next legal claimants to their land. Nevertheless, the English had gained so much influence here over the years that the Boers could not simply annex the land, as they had been advised to do at first, if they did not want to get into a serious dispute with England. However, the current time did not seem favorable for this. The political situation in South Africa had developed in a very peculiar way in recent years, especially as a result of the flourishing of the South African Republic brought about by the gold discoveries and the influx of many thousands of English adventurers. There are roughly three distinct political tendencies in South Africa, which are now quite sharply opposed to each other. The anti-Boer English and the anti-English Boers currently form the minority, while the supporters of the "Afrikanderbund", which is becoming increasingly friendly to the English, form the majority. The Afrikanderbund had been showing a double face for some time. It was led by J. H. Hofmeyr from Cape Town, a highly respected man who had previously been regarded as an "upright Afrikaander", but who differed greatly from his friends on the other side of the Baal in his view of the aims of the League. While the radical Afrikaners were working towards independence from England, the important people at the top, including du Toit and Joubert, had issued the program of a new South African policy, which can be seen as a kind of reconciliation policy and also attracted people who, although of English descent, were no longer in close contact with the mother country. This program culminates above all in the striving to bring about a closer connection between the individual states of South Africa, which is to be achieved through freedom of trade, common railroads and unity of customs borders. Political amalgamation under one flag is ruled out for the time being and must be reserved for a later time. The upright Afrikaners of the Afrikanderbund are heading for the "United States of South Africa" under the supremacy of the Boers, but the moderate ones are thinking "under the English flag", as has only recently become apparent. Clothed with the dignity of an extraordinary High Commissioner of the English Crown, Hofmeyr went to Practoria to negotiate with the Transvaalers in order to keep them and their country dependent on England and, on top of that, to bring them into dependence on the Cape! The radical Boers were outraged by the impositions England was making on them, but even the old President Krüger could not ignore the view that, if the proposals were rejected, war with England would not have been an impossibility. The People's Council of the Republic had long misgivings before giving its assent to the treaty; when the Secretary of State read out the text of the treaty, several Boers, outraged at the demands made therein, jumped up from their seats, and the old cry of "England is mighty, but God is almighty" was heard again, but the final result was the acceptance of the treaty by 20 votes to 10. The South African Republic could look in all directions, it had no friend it could count on. Transvaal missed the time, and it must be said, also through its own fault; it never looked wholeheartedly for help, it always persisted in its isolation, and if it really did seek affiliation with another power, one could be sure that only a minority of the Boers vigorously supported it. Thus the "Volksstem" in Practoria wrote at the end of July, unfortunately too late, under the heading "Germany and Tranovaal": "In the last weeks and months in particular, the German element has been developing vigorous activity throughout East Africa, which has not ceased to attract attention and even concern in England. It is becoming more and more apparent that the authoritative circles in Berlin are serious in their efforts to challenge Britain's sole dominance in colonization and trade and to consolidate Germanic influence alongside, perhaps even above, British influence in some parts of our part of the world. One remembers the reports from which it could be seen how the rapid appearance of the German commanders, both in the vicinity of the Sultan of Zanzibar and on the East African mainland, considerably enhanced the reputation of the German Empire. If one further considers that Germany is proving by facts not only in the political but also in the commercial field that it wants to compete vigorously with England - the establishment of the German East African Steamship Company, which will send its ships as far as the Delagoadai - one will realize of one's own accord how important this expansion of the Germanic tribe can become for us inhabitants of the South African Republic. Recently a phenomenon has appeared in official and other newspapers which should not go unnoticed in this country. It is no secret that at the time there was not much interest in the young South African Republic in German government circles. Even a visit that President Krüger made to the Berlin court yielded only very meagre results for our state, so that there was very little desire on the part of our government to enter into closer relations with Germany. However, a change seems to be gradually taking place in this situation, especially on the German side; it seems to be rightly recognized that the South African Republic is not really the quantité negligeablo that it has long been thought to be; it is gradually becoming clear in the banking, trading and industrial world of the German Empire that there is a vast field of activity north of the Vaal River where there is room for other people besides the English. And it is precisely in German government circles that the conviction seems to be gaining ground that the Boer Republic, which was held in such low esteem at the time, is worth a closer look. One can already notice - and this is the phenomenon we wanted to point out - in the tone of German newspapers that the attempts at rapprochement between our republic and Germany are no longer treated with indifference in the latter country, and we remember having read some time ago even a veiled reference to the fact that our government had already hesitated too long with the first step towards such a rapprochement. Where such words are shouted at us, we must not be deceived, all the less so as the words certainly come from important quarters in Berlin. We are already trying to understand how little the "friendship" of England has brought us and will bring us. Shouldn't the friendship of the German Reich sometimes become something more than a vain sound for our state! The "Zuid=Africaan", which represents the moderate side of the Afrikander=Bund, commented: "Letters sent by the government to the High Commissioner in Practoria at the beginning of last year testify to the government's desire to show its appreciation for the attitude that England has adopted towards the Republic, and Sir H. Loch's meeting with President Krüger seems to have made a reasonable impression on him. - On the other hand, we cannot say otherwise than that we find the idea of the "Volksstem" to seek in Germany, after it begins to deal with African affairs, a kind of counterweight to England, highly wrong and even dangerous Germany is still a newcomer in colonial policy, and if she is induced to seek her advantage in good agreement with Trausvaal, and thus more or less publicly to oppose England's plans for the domination of our part of the world, it is certain that she would abandon her alliance as soon as she could gain anything else by it. To maintain direct influence outside South Africa is as proper a policy for the Cape Colony as for the Republics, but it is contrary to the Monroe policy formerly advocated by the "Volksstem". To involve Germany or any other European power in the affairs of our part of the world must lead to false results. When, in the old tale of Reinecke Fuchs, the lion, as king of the forests, made peace with the bear and the wolf, they resolved to eat the ram together, and we do not pretend that a peace on such grounds could not be concluded with good success in South Africa on occasion; but we really do not wish the South African Republic to form the main dish at a meal between two European powers. The "Volköstem" replied: "We know that by the Monroe policy is meant the well-known state policy pursued by the United States of North America, according to which any interference in the affairs of non-American states is avoided and, on the other hand, any interference by non-American states in the affairs of American states is not tolerated. For our part, we are not afraid to express our opinion that this so-called Monroe policy will also have to be obeyed in South Africa one day. For the principle that a possible future South African confederation will do best to resist all foreign interference and at the same time to refrain itself from any interference in foreign affairs cannot but bear the same beautiful fruits which it has hitherto yielded for America. But it seems to us that the time for the realization of this idea is still too remote. In the present state of affairs in South Africa, there can be no question of pursuing or not pursuing the Monroe policy, for it implies the complete annihilation of British supremacy on our political scene. We do not doubt that this annihilation will one day occur; but it cannot be denied that this overweight is still pressing down on our part of the world. Finally, to return to our German-minded tendencies, even in connection with the Monroe policy, we recall that the United States of North America - whose striving for independence can hardly be doubted - did not hesitate to call on the help of a foreign power when they needed support in their war of liberation against England. Benjamin Franklin's mission to France and the success achieved through an alliance with that country are well known. Now, what France was to the North American Republic in its early days can be seen, for example, in

Page 262

 Germany for the South African Republic. We even believe that Germany would be able to enjoy more lasting benefits from its assistance than were then enjoyed by France. In any case, the policy defended by us does not seem to be able to interfere with the future plans of a critically applied monroe policy of the United South Africa. But the Anglo-German agreement, and especially the yielding spirit which spoke from it, has dashed these hopes of help from Germany; more than one South African newspaper openly expresses its conviction that now that Salisbury and Caprivi are walking arm in arm, all support for the Republic from the German side has disappeared. The hand offered by the Netherlands, which the Republic has only hesitantly grasped, a fact which was very badly noted in Holland, is also not strong enough to avert disaster, and Portugal is on the ground. As far as the treaty itself is concerned, the content of the most important articles as reported in No. 18 of the "Deutsche Kolonialzeitung" is completely sufficient. The Republic may indeed lay a railroad through Swaziland to the Kosibai and thus have the long-desired connection with the sea coast, but Article 10 of the treaty gives England the right to transport troops on it at will, and not only did the Republic have to undertake never to conclude treaties with the natives in the north and northwest of its territory, i.e. Matabele= and Betabele=. i.e. Matabele= and Betschuanaland, in which numerous Boers have already settled, to England without further ado, but the mixed government of Swaziland, i.e. consisting of a representative of the Republic and the Cape Colony, remains in place and the strip of land that the former receives for its railroad is only three miles wide and 10 miles wide on the Kosibai itself. Even more disastrous for the future of the Transvaal, however, is the obligation imposed on it to form a customs union with Cape Land, Natal and the Orange Free State within three years. The English trade at the Cape, which has seen the Delagoa Railway approaching its realization with a shy eye, can now be reassured; the import duties at the Delagoa or Kosibai can no longer be lower than at the Cape, which will now more than ever become the great and exclusive port for South Africa. If the Republic refuses to accede to this customs union, then the agreements regarding the Kosibai will also be null and void and Swazi and Amatongaland will sooner or later become English crown colonies, so that access to the coast in this direction will then be walled off forever. What will be the consequence of this convention? For one thing, it is probable that the Afrikanderbund will be broken up, for it can hardly be assumed that all Boers hostile to England will continue to go along with this policy, which sooner or later will have to leave them at the mercy of England, especially if, as it now appears, a strong English immigration to Matabele= and Maschonaland sets in. We fear that the narrowing of the South African Republic is now proceeding with giant strides and that its political situation will worsen from year to year after this defeat, that instead of the Transvaal the Cape will take over the leadership of South African interests in a pro-English sense. The bait of the foundation of a South African Union thrown out by Prime Minister Rhodes has been swallowed, albeit with reluctance, and the prospect of even greater economic prosperity than bioher has turned the heads of many Boers. Transvaal's political independence is as good as dead. The English have won across the board. The Me Kinley Bill. As is generally known, on October 6, the so-called Me Kinley Bill came into force in the United States of America, by which the protective customs system long followed by North America has been carried to extremes. Although North American industry is by no means in a distressed situation, but is developing vigorously, an extreme protective tariff policy has become popular, firstly to force Europe to allow the import of American agricultural products, some of which are banned, but also to exert pressure on South America after the Pan-American Congress') has been silently buried. The law caused great consternation in the European industrialized countries, as some industries would only remain viable by exporting to North America, and only those products that require special artistic treatment or technical skills for their manufacture, which can only be achieved through many years of training, would be allowed to remain exportable *) See No. 35 of the Deutsche Kolonialzeitung 1889.
can. The extent of the damage caused to European industry by the tariff policy of the United States cannot yet be estimated, but judging by the discouragement that has set in in many industrial circles, the worst is expected; for the United States was one of the most important markets in Europe, as is shown by the following table, which shows the contribution of the individual states to the imports and exports of the Union in the fiscal year 1888/89: Percentages Percentages Import Export Countries Total Dollars Total Dollars Import Export Great Britain with 178 269 067 379 990 131 23, 52.4 Germany 81 742546 66 568 695 10.97 912 France 69 566 618 9.2 45 110922 Jtaly 17992 149 12 543928 Switzerland 13343701 Netherlands 10950843 14 800780 2 Belgium 9816 435 22 603 406 Austria=Hungary7612 297 720825 0.10 Of the 81,742,546 dollars exported by Germany in the 1888/89 fiscal year ended June 30, the following amounts were attributable to the industries most involved: Wool products ... 10,763,980 dollars Leather and leather of which: manufactures . . . 3 375 586 Dollars finished clothing . 1069 358 thereof: Yarns . . . .. 1019 080 Gloves and garment socks for glove leather 1 988 873 Women and children .... 3 56089 Flax, hessian, jute hosiery 639 966 and made-up cloth . .. .. 2619907 thereof . . . .. 217400 Silk goods ... 8 803 109 Glass and glassware of which: goods . . . . 2 030 856 Clothing fabrics . . 1 785 999 thereof: Cotton fiberglass 1229 083 kate . . . . . . 6 917438 of which: Paper and paper hosiery, manufactures ... 1641 100 Underwear.

But it is necessary to come back to the difficulties of finding secure markets for our highly developed industry. For years now, the German export business has been looking for new markets; the proposals from both the professional and the unprofessional side are numerous, but, as the idea of the floating exhibition, for example, has shown, so little has been clarified that the industry has no real confidence in the costly and risky attempts. At the moment it still has South America as a large sales area, but whether exports will be capable of a large increase is an open question. After all, the hope of displacing American goods there, whose competitiveness has been weakened by the price increases, is quite questionable. North American manufacturers will know how to make North American consumers pay higher prices in order to be able to compete more easily in foreign markets. As far as South Africa is concerned, the South African customs union is in the near future, in Australia the English still dominate the market and a change in conditions in our favor requires a completely new trading system,") the Asian states are still partially receptive, but German trade relations are suffering from competition from the English, and in some states, such as Siam, for example, the German trade relations can still be improved. Siam, for example, German capital can only gradually venture into them Wherever we look, we either see the states closing themselves off to European products or at least valuing them so highly, *) See "German Trade with Australia". Published by M. F. Bahse at the instigation of the Leipzig Chamber of Commerce.

that only competition from countries with particularly cheap wages or exceptionally favorable production conditions, to which Germany does not belong, will be possible. The eye must involuntarily turn to our colonies, which, however, do not yet count as far as the ability of their natives to consume European articles is concerned. But this is simply due to the fact that the German spirit of enterprise has preferred to turn first to those areas whose exploitation was less difficult and less dangerous to life and limb. But the more this circle narrows, the more our colonies will gain in attraction and the more our industry will have to turn its attention to the work of developing these countries. Thus the Me Kinley Bill may become of great influence to our colonial movement. The Wanjamuesi. By Paul Reichard. (Continued.) A lot of honey is collected in the forest by wild bees. The Mjamuesi follow the guiding call of the honey kukuk, which draws the attention of those wandering through the forest with its cries and chirps and then leads them to a beehive, which is located in some hollow tree. The Wanjamuesi make a very tasty meth from honey. A little red sorghum flour is added to seven parts water and one part honey and left to stand overnight near the fire. In the morning, the result is a highly carbonated, moussing drink with a pleasantly sour taste. The smoking. The Mjamnesi is a passionate smoker of tobacco and Hauf. Tobacco grows everywhere in Unjamnesi in a heavy, unpleasant-smelling quality. However, people are too lazy to grow it extensively, although there is a lively demand for tobacco in Unjamnesi and neighboring Ugogo, where you can exchange a goat, even a cow, for 10-20 pounds of tobacco. The treatment of the tobacco is very peculiar. The green leaves are crushed in wooden mortars. Then large round and flat loaves three fingers thick and one span in diameter are formed, which are left to dry in the sun and at the same time lightly fermented; or the leaves are plaited into plaits and wound together into a flat roll and held by inserted sticks. The men smoke the tobacco from water pipes, which are made from gourds with a clay head attached. The smoke is drawn into the lungs. After three or four deep puffs, the smoker emits an ugly, animal-sounding cough in the fistula and then hands the pipe to his neighbor, who does the same. You only ever put in enough tobacco so that the large bowl is smoked out after 17-18 puffs. As the tobacco burns very badly, a glowing coal must always be placed on top. The women smoke just as passionately as the men, but rarely use the water pipe, instead they use a pipe with a clay bowl, which has some similarity to Turkish pipes. The women smoke much more than the men and almost always carry their pipes around with them. They begin to smoke regularly as girls from 6 to 8 years of age, and I have often seen mothers allow their five-, even four-year-old children to take single puffs from the pipe. Boys usually do not start until they are 11 or 12. Tobacco is also heavily consumed as snuff. Snuffing is always done with a comical grandeur. Snuff is prepared by roasting the leaves dried in a potsherd or the prepared tobacco over a fire, so that a very fine flour is produced, which the uninitiated would mistake for anything else rather than tobacco from its smell and appearance. To the same degree as tobacco, the Mjamuesi heap, called njemu there, smokes the leaves and unripe seeds of the common heap. It is simply dried in the sun and smoked in water pipes with very large bowls. The very foul-smelling smoke is sucked into the lungs, just as with tobacco, and after a few puffs the smoker begins to emit the strangest sounds in the fistula. At the beginning of the trip, I jumped up several times to observe the hemp smoker in the presumed rapture or stupor, but to my astonishment I only ever found a person crouching quietly on a mat or a wooden block, clasping his knees with his arms and observing his surroundings with a highly indifferent face. The impression was always a highly ridiculous one. The heap had produced no effect at all at the moment. I asked about the cause of the shouting and was always told that it was customary. Nevertheless, the consumption is very harmful. The nervous system is completely disrupted, but the effects only become noticeable after many years of use and then end in fits of rage and insanity. If someone continues to commit foolish acts, the Mjamuesi say "Niemu" (heap) without using this word for madness. Madness is called usassi there. The inhalation of smoke, which is common in tobacco smoking, has an immediate and much more violent effect than Hauf, and it happens relatively often that smokers who indulge in the pleasure of tobacco smoking alone in their huts fall into the embers of their fire at night, completely stunned, remain unconscious and often suffer such burns that the result is loss of limbs and even death here and there. Dwellings. The Mjamuesi live in so-called "Msongä", i.e. huts with a circular floor plan and a conical thatched roof. The 1½-2½ meter high circular wall is made of sticks or logs, which are placed close together in a narrow trench and then tamped down with the earth thrown out and held together very well by bundles of rods tied one third of the way up from each other. The wall is covered inside and out with clay, which is carefully smoothed by hand, as is the threshing floor. The roof is put together from poles and rods, either on the spot or on the ground next to the hut, and then the scaffolding is put on, but always without support inside. Covered with straw carefully laid from bottom to top, the roof offers complete protection against the rain. The diameter of such huts varies between 4 and even 10 meters, the height of the conical roof between 5 and 10 meters. There are no window openings anywhere, nor are there any openings for the smoke to escape through the thatched roof. Only one door allows access to the interior of the hut. This door is either made of tightly bound durrasteel stalks and is given strength by two transverse poles on which the stalks are tied, or large pieces of bast from the miombo tree. The doors never move like wings on hinges, but are pushed sideways and held upright by two stakes attached to the inside. The lock consists of an arm-thick wooden club hanging crosswise from a bast rope or skin strap; the wooden pestle, which is used for pounding flour, is often used for this purpose. Village facilities, Tembe and Ipuri. The Wansamuesi live together in villages or patches or sometimes in individual huts. The villages, consisting of very irregular hut complexes, are in most cases surrounded by a so-called boma. This boma consists of 3-5 meter high, thigh- to arm-thick trunks, which always have to be used rather crooked and crooked due to the lack of straight grown wood. These trunks are placed 2-3 behind each other in a foot-wide trench dug with a hoe, which is drawn around the place to be fortified, and the trunks are held very firmly in place by the earth that is poured back in and tamped down. Trunks are inserted at intervals of 3-4 meters, which fork at a height of 2 meters, so that one arm protrudes outwards, the other inwards, and in these protruding arms, both inside and outside, the longest possible poles in the thickness of a forearm are placed on top of each other in five to six times the number, and these poles give the pallisades an extremely firm structure, without any mortise and tenon or other connections, such as bast ropes or wooden nails, being used. A trench 1-2 meters deep is then dug on the outside and the excavated material is thrown against the pallisades as a rampart. Arm-thick holes are cut out to form embrasures. If a village fortified in this way is built in the middle of a bush thicket, or if such a thicket is created in the future, the village is virtually impregnable without the aid of cannons, unless, as is usually the case, the well is dug outside the fortification, so that the inhabitants run the risk of dying of thirst in the event of a siege. In recent times, the so-called "tembe" has become increasingly popular in Unjamuesi. The tembe is a highly impractical type of construction native to Uhähä and Ugogo, whose only advantage is that it is well suited for defensive purposes. The tembe

Page 264

consists of two parallel walls, also built of poles and logs, 1½-3 meters high, which are covered with a very flat, almost horizontal roof, forming an elongated dark living space, also only provided with door openings. The roof rests on three round longitudinal beams, the middle one of which is no more than a foot higher than the side beams and is supported by leg-thick trunks stripped of bark and usually also sapwood, resting on a forked extension. The rafters consist of unattached logs on which durrah stalks or straw are laid. Loamy laterite earth serves as the covering material. With every heavy downpour, the soil of the roof is of course partially washed away and the water penetrates into the interior. These tembe are very inadequate as human dwellings but, as already mentioned, are becoming more and more widespread in East Africa because they can be defended very easily once a few embrasures have been made. For the purpose of fortification, the tembe is built continuously around the villages and is then called Ipuri in Unjamuesi. Incidentally, the Ipuri is also inhabited by individual families, as are tembe of different lengths erected individually in the village. Weapons. The Wanjamnesi are a rather warlike people who are always ready to strike, but this is not to say that they are particularly brave. In any case, in this respect they are far behind the Wahähä, and especially the Massat. Their original weapons, bow and arrow, are increasingly being replaced by imported firearms, while they all still wield the throwing lance as their favorite weapon. The bows are carved from so-called koma or mkuwwa wood and are simply curved and not quite as tall as a man. The string is twisted from two strips of skin which, after drying in the sun, is rubbed smooth between two stones and wound onto the wood of the bow at such a length that the archer always has a spare string to hand. The Wanjamuesi make three types of arrows, those with cane shafts and wooden tips and those with carved wooden shafts and iron tips. However, all are fitted with a triple vane to regulate the flight of the arrow. The wooden points either have a round base at the front, the diameter of a two-mark piece, and these are used for shooting birds, not so as not to injure the bird, but so that the arrow cannot stick in the wood and branches of the trees in the event of a miss due to its blunt point. The wooden points for hunting and war purposes are one and a half spans long, carved from black ebony and are more feared than the myrtle-leaf-shaped iron points with numerous barbs carved into them, as the latter penetrate very deeply and shatter completely on bone. The arrows fly no further than 160-170 paces and hit quite safely at 40-50 paces. The Wanjamuesi are not very skilled archers, but they are much better at it than all the tribes living west of Tanganyika. Strangely enough, they hardly ever practise, even as boys. Wanjamuest lances have a myrtle-leaf-shaped blade two to three fingers wide, the tip of which is always slightly rounded. The length of the blade varies between 1-2 spans, the shaft is never thicker than a thumb and the whole lance varies between 1½ to 1¾ meters. They are used almost exclusively for throwing, the somewhat stronger ones also for thrusting. The Wawende also wield heavy lances with wider blades, the blade of which has a strong rib, a masterpiece of blacksmithing. Lances are not hurled further than 30-40 paces. They are a very dangerous weapon. The Wanjamnest no longer carry shields. The Wagalla used wooden shields for the longest time. Their knives with small myrtle-leaf-shaped blades cannot really be counted as weapons, they are only used for cutting. Clubs with short ½ meter long handles and a carved ci-shaped pointed head made from a root tuber are also very popular. Warfare. Although the Wanjamuesi, as already mentioned, are not among the bravest of the ruling peoples, they are nevertheless very warlike. There is always war somewhere in their country and on its borders, or at least raids are being carried out. Most wars are preceded by a declaration of war. Some strong chieftain sends a message to the one from whom he believes he can extort tribute. This message contains an arrow or a shotgun pellet and an iron hoe. The recipient then has to choose between these objects. If he takes the iron hoe, he indicates his submission by saying that he prefers to build a field and is willing to pay the tribute demanded. However, if he chooses the arrow or the bullet, the decision is left to the Wasfen. The warband marches towards the enemy village in extremely strenuous marches, with the warriors arranging to surround it shortly before sunrise and immediately launch an assault. If the attackers penetrate the village, the men who are able to defend themselves are slaughtered, women, boys and girls are taken as booty, the village is plundered and then set on fire. If resistance is found, however, the enemy proceeds to lay siege. Camps fortified with pallisades are erected all around, within firing range of each other, so that the besieged are cut off from the outside world. At suitable points, the Wanjamuesi then build firing towers, 10 to 15 meters high, made of poles and thick logs, on several levels. Those inside are protected against bullets. From these firing towers, which are sometimes built up to 20 m from the enemy fortifications, good marksmen can inflict considerable losses on the besieged by shooting away people who show themselves to the marksman. Sometimes assault attacks are then undertaken, but usually the enemy fortress falls through starvation. The small raid in Unjamnesi is very popular. Larger or smaller gangs of Ruga Ruga lie in wait along the road for individuals, especially caravan trains, in order to plunder them. If caravans are not well armed, they are attacked from all sides; otherwise, however, the robbers are content to rob weary warriors who are left behind; if they flee, they seize their loads, but if they defend themselves, they knock them down. Open field battles are very rare. Larger areas are usually tyrannized over by strong chiefs, as Mirambo did in his time when he held the entire country of Unjamuesi in terror. He lived in the north-east of Tabora and collected tribute from all areas there. If the chiefs refused to do so, he easily waged war on them and in most cases was himself at the head of his warriors. In addition to his outstanding intellectual qualities, this circumstance also ensured his success to a large extent. As he protected his own subjects, his country became more and more populated and was in a flourishing state until his death in 1884. In addition to Mirambo, another chief, Simba, lived south of Tabora. He sustained himself more from highway robbery and high tribute payments, which passing Arab traders and also European travelers had to pay him here and there, until he was defeated and driven out by Mirambo. A third equally feared chief named Rjungu still lives in Ukonongo on the border of Uhähä. He also lives from tribute extortion and war, but in order not to be in danger of being besieged himself, he does not tolerate any human settlement, no matter how small, within a wide radius of 8 to 10 days' journey around his only town, which is very well fortified. A besieging army would therefore have to starve there. Moreover, it is situated in a place where there is very little water. All the chiefs obtain their supplies of powder and water from the Arabs, from whom they exchange them for ivory. Hunting and fishing. The Unjamuesi country is very rich in game due to its large size. Nevertheless, the Wanjamuesi are only poor hunters and do not hunt as a sport, but more as work to obtain meat. They occasionally shoot a piece of game with an arrow, but such success is probably more a matter of chance. More often now they shoot it with rifles. The professional hunter always uses the long shotguns and especially the old flint guns, because the flints are easier to obtain than the expensive primers and because they have a larger caliber, in which the commonly used, home-made iron pellets can be used, namely 2-4 pieces for each shot with an enormous powder charge. The hunter sneaks very close up to 10-15 paces, especially on elephants, which are now quite rare in Unjamuesi. One tries to smash a leg bone of these animals with good success, whereupon the elephant, as a passanger and because of its weight, can go no further. Hunting these animals with javelins is no longer practiced in Unjamuesi. The Wawende still hunt the buffalo with spears of six or seven. Most of the game is caught in pits, which are 2 to 2½ meters deep and narrow downwards, interrupting the game fence built in the forest at certain intervals, so that the game can approach the very well-masked pits from both sides by forced changes. Except elephants,

Page 265

Rhinoceros, buffalo and giraffe, all large game such as zebra, a number of antelope species and pigs are sometimes caught in nets and then killed, but this hunting method is not very common because of the great effort involved. The very numerous feathered game, ducks, francolins and guinea fowl, are caught in snares and artfully devised snap traps. The latter are also often used to catch the large herds of monkeys, guenons and baboons, which cause enormous damage in the fields. The Wakonongo are the only tribe of the Wanjamuesi who enjoy the disgusting smelling meat of the monkeys and the domestic rat. Small game such as hares, spring rats and numerous field rats are also caught in snares or hunted with dogs. Not all Wanjamuesi tribes eat fish; the Wasumboa, for example, find them highly disgusting. The fish are either shot with arrows or caught in traps and nets or stunned by poisonous fruit thrown into the water and then caught. The fish are all dried on wooden grates by the fire and smoked. Boiling the fish is completely unknown to the Wanjamuesi. Agriculture. Farming is the main occupation of the Wanjamuesi. After the first heavy rains at the end of October or beginning of November, which usher in the rainy season, they start farming with a kind of passion. Men and women go out early in the morning at 6 a.m. and work hard until the evening, with only a rest break of 1-1½ hours, which is used for eating. With their heart-shaped iron hoes, they throw up rows 40-50 centimeters high, the tops of which are 1 meter apart. They then use their fingers or toes to make holes in the loosened soil at the top of the rows and throw a few grains of durra and maize into each hole and then scrape the soil over them again. Large areas are often worked in this way, by men and women together. Once the fields have all been tilled at the end of December, however, the men abandon themselves to idleness and leave the work to the women alone until the harvest is brought in, such as weeding out the weeds and guarding the fields to keep birds, game and monkeys away, which light work is also done by the boys and girls. At the end of January or February, two months after sowing, the maize is already ripe and the women and children break off the cobs, the maize stalks are then pulled up and burnt after drying. At the same time as the maize, the durrah, the cassava grain, has grown to the same height, but now that the maize stalks have been uprooted, it has more room to grow and reaches the respectable height of 5-6 meters after 6-7, even after 8 months. The ear panicles are harvested in August by bending the long stalks, which are often more than a thumb thick, and cutting off the ears individually with a knife. They are then threshed on threshing floors in the open field with long poles and the corn is stored in stacks, which have the same shape as the huts, only somewhat more elongated and standing on a ½ meter high pole grid to protect against insects and moisture. The corn is either hung in bundles on poles in the open air or stored inside the huts in large barrel-like bark boxes, lindo. In addition to the cereals just mentioned, the Wanjamuesi plant sweet potatoes, pam roots, various legumes, arachis or peanuts, from which they prepare oil, and a lot of vegetables. When the entire harvest is brought in by mid-September at the latest, the villagers celebrate the pleasant time that follows by singing choral songs or dancing every evening, and the women prepare a lot of pombe when the harvest is good. Porters. When the fields are fully cultivated at the beginning of March or mid-April at the latest, the maize harvest has already been brought in and the rainy season has come to an end, most of the men head for the coast. First to Tabora, where some of them are recruited as ivory carriers and thus receive food for the whole journey as well as a very small fee. Another part, however, travels to the coastal towns without loads, equipped only with iron picks to buy food on the way. On the coast, the people are then received by Indians, who oblige them by giving them copper money for their daily sustenance to such an extent that they can no longer get away from them and are then hired out to Arabs by "their Indian". For a load of 60 to 80 English pounds and more, the Wanjamuesi carriers receive cloth, white and colored cotton goods, powder and rifles, as well as a few small items worth about 8 to 12 dollars, 1 dollar equals 1 Maria Theresiathaler or 3.30 to 3.50 marks. The Arabs or Europeans, however, have to pay 20 to 30 and even 35 dollars per man from the coast to Tabora, depending on the number of porters available; from there new ones have to be hired for further journeys. The Wanjamuesi porters usually hire three porters themselves to transport their wages. However, not a single Mjamuesi brings his wages home, everything is "eaten up" in Ugogo except for 8 to 16, at most 24 forearm lengths of cloth. Only the rifle is not sold, unless in dire need. The only person who brings cloth home is the Mdäwa or caravan leader. The hardships and exertions on the journey are endless; carrying loads, hunger, cold, thirst, illness and epidemics, such as smallpox and dysentery, decimate the Wanjamuesi carriers every year, so that it is hardly understandable why people repeatedly undergo such hardships without bringing home a reward. There are two reasons for this phenomenon. Firstly, the Wanjamuesi have an extraordinary wanderlust, more pronounced than that of any other tribe in Africa. Traveling with its pleasures and pains, the eternal variety, the high degree of personal freedom compared to the social constraints at home, if one may say so, the pleasure of adventures, the women, the carelessness with regard to food and a hundred other things make traveling seem so tempting to the Wanjamuesi that he disregards the effort of carrying a load and other inconveniences. However, the pronounced wanderlust is not the only reason for the Wanjamucst's coastal migrations. One of the main reasons for these annual mass migrations is the opportunity for a good life in Ugogo, where there is an abundance of everything the stomach of the good Wanjamuesi desires. There is pombe and milk, meat from cattle, sheep, goats and chickens, honey, durrah and peanuts, pulses and tasty vegetables such as cucumbers, pumpkins and watermelons, all in abundance. When the Wanjamuesi carrier has passed through the country after one to one and a half months' stay in Ugogo, which all caravans need for the short distance, because of the tribute payment there, he has become fat and obese, but also has hardly enough of his wages to be able to clothe himself. (Conclusion follows.) From Southwest Africa. The more embarrassing the news of the massacre of Küntzel's expedition in Witu, immediately after the transfer of the protectorate from Germany to England, must have been for us, the more gratifying it is to see how the consolidation of German rule is slowly but surely progressing in South West Africa. Dr. Göring, who had returned to the protectorate in the spring of 1890, issued important decrees immediately after his arrival, regulating the import and trade of water and ammunition, as well as the trade in spirits. A third proclamation related to the granting of mining concessions by the native chiefs. In 1886, the Imperial Commissioner had already decreed that the chiefs in the South West African protectorate may only grant concessions or modify existing ones with the consent of the mining authorities. This decree was now extended to the entire German sphere of interest in South West Africa. Even before the arrival of the Reichskommissar, the leader of the Schutztruppe, Captain v. François, had embarked on a reconnaissance journey into the interior of the country, while his brother, Lieutenant v. François, moved to Otyimbingue and Okahandja with 40 men of the Schutztruppe (10 men remained behind in Tsaobis). In both places, Lieutenant v. Frangois was warmly welcomed by the Hereros, and in the latter place - the seat of Chief Maharero - also by him. At the end of March, the troop set off from Okahandja to Rehoboth. Even before the latter place was reached, Captain v. François, returning from Lake Ngami, met up with the troops and entered Rehoboth on April 6. He was given a festive welcome by the entire population. In the meantime, following an invitation from Maharero, Dr. Göring had gone to Okahandja. There, in May, a

Page 266

A solemn meeting was held in which about 50 Herero took part. On behalf of Maharero, Chief Manasseh of Omaruru declared on behalf of the entire Herero nation that the latter adhered to the protection treaty concluded with Germany and regarded the Germans as their brothers. Captain von François, who had also attended the meeting in Okahandja, met with the Schutztruppe again in Otjikango on June 6. He intended to stay in Otjikango until June 12 and then march again to Rehoboth. On July 1, Captain von François arrived back in Wilhelmsfeste (Tsaobis) with the Schutztruppe, while Dr. Göring went to the southern part of the Schutzgebiet via Rehoboth. According to recent news, he has succeeded in concluding a treaty of protection and friendship with the captain of the Bondelzwaarts, Willem Christian in Warmbad, who had previously repeatedly refused to enter into a protective relationship with Germany. As a result, the German protective power in the south of Namaqualand is extended to the border of the German sphere of interest, i.e. to the Orange River and the 20th degree east longitude, and the two existing German settlements of Petersen in Außenkehr and Dominicus in Stolzenfels on the Orange River must now also enjoy German protection. It will now be the task of the imperial government to neutralize the chief of Gibeon, Hendrik Witboy, who is disturbing both Großnama= and Damaraland with his continuous raids, and thus give the natives as well as any immigrants the security that they can enjoy the fruits of their labour undisturbed. Without this security, it will neither be possible to encourage the natives to make greater efforts to regain their former prosperity, nor to stimulate the enterprise of foreigners for the settlement of the country to any considerable extent. After concluding the protection treaty with the Bondelzwaarts, Dr. Göring went to Cape Town in order to return to Europe from there. In its issue of September 11, the "South African Newspaper" published in Cape Town published the following reports on the conclusion of the treaty and on a meeting with Dr. Goering, which we pass on to our readers without assuming any responsibility for the content, especially with regard to the statements made to the Reich Commissioner. The "South African Newspaper" writes: From the German protectorate. On August 21, our Reichskommissar, Dr. H. Göring, who is honoured everywhere in the protectorate, hoisted the German flag on a high pole at Warmbad in the Bondelzwaart area, thus bringing the strenuous work of the Reichskommissar in our South West African colony to a happy conclusion. It was a peaceful act that was accomplished there, and the favorable consequences of it will begin to show themselves within a short time. The white people living in the country had come from far and near to greet the Reichskommissar and the German flag, and for Warmbad it was the largest number of white people that had ever been together there. In addition, the Veldschoedräger tribe had also arrived and, like Willem Christian and the Bondelzwaarts, placed themselves under German protection, Unfortunately, not all was happy and content, and the general rejoicing was disturbed by the arrival of the news that the robber chief Hendrik Wittbol, equipped with an inordinate amount of shooting equipment (rifles, 70,000 cartridges, 800 pounds of powder, plus a lot of lead xc.), to new raids, this time to the south against the peaceful and peace-loving Bondelzwaarts. This large quantity of ammunition was delivered to Wittboy a few months ago by the trader Duncan von Keetmannshoop and with the consent of the Cape Government, contrary to all the counter-proposals of our Reichskommissar, and disregarding all the fine promises on their part. This is the thanks we Germans reap from the English for our friendly concessions. It is truly disgraceful that the munitions used by Wittboy not only to damage German interests but also to rob and murder neighbors living in the deepest peace have been delivered. We hope, however, that the damage that has been done to us all will be felt accordingly. It is very much to be hoped that our German imperial government will finally make up its mind and make use of the valuable experience gained by the Reichskommissar in the country and in life with the natives - and do so there - and act accordingly with all its energy. If this is done, if an end is put to the raids of the Wittboy, if an orderly administration is set up in the Bondelzwaart area, then peace and tranquillity will return, the prosperity of the country and its inhabitants will improve, and German and English forces will do their utmost to further the many interests that both have in common in our colony for the best.
An interview with Reichskommissar Dr. Göring. On Friday, the 5th of this month, the news spread that our Reichskommissar, Dr. Göring, had arrived in Cape Town overland from the protectorate. Our reporter therefore immediately took the opportunity to request an interview with the high dignitary, which was granted with the greatest courtesy. The conversation first turned to the newly acquired territories of the Bondelzwaarts and Veldschoeträger, whose lands, although lying within the German sphere of interest, had not yet been acquired by the German Empire by treaty. Dr. Göring had finally settled the matter with the chief and carried out the final act of annexation by hoisting the German flag. "Do you consider these territories particularly valuable?" was our reporter's question. "Definitely," was the answer. "These areas deserve special respect because of their proximity to the colony, their large grasslands and their relative abundance of water, which lies underground and can be easily tapped by wells everywhere." "Then these areas would surpass the Cape Colonial river areas on this side of the Orange in value." "This is certainly the case; and proof of this is shown by the fact that so many Capetonians wish to settle across the river into German territory. "Thus Germany would have achieved what the whole nation is so eagerly striving for, namely colonies that are suitable for accommodating larger farming masses," our reporter interjected. "Not in the sense that is desired," replied the Reichskommissar. "Farming on a large scale is not possible where there is no rain and irrigation is only possible by artificial means. On the other hand, the land would be ideal for cattle breeding and agriculture, following the example of the Boer farms. Therefore, we could do nothing better than to settle as many Boers as possible and the many German compatriots already living in South Africa in our protected areas. "Couldn't we achieve the same thing if we brought in German farmers instead of Dutch Boers! "Oh, certainly," was the answer; "but this has its difficulties. Here followed a more exact statement of the costs and expenses with which the emigration from Germany, the purchase of implements, local expenses, etc., are connected for the emigrating farmer, with the final consideration that, if a German farmer desirous of emigrating has such capital at his disposal, he will prefer to go to America. "But can the German government not intervene to help here? How can it be explained that so little is being done from Verlin and that the country does not even have an adequate administration?" - Our rapporteur had spoken somewhat hesitantly, for it concerned the core of the conversation. As far as your first question was concerned, this had already been answered by the government itself when it declared that it only wanted to open up the land to private enterprise. There is, however, an administration of the protectorate in Otimbinque; but I have already emphasized many times that this is not sufficient, especially for the Jewish parts, given the inadequate transport conditions and the long distances. "So we can hope that, according to your reports in Berlin, there will be a change for the better in this respect?" The Reichskommissar was silent for a moment. Then he replied without hesitation: "As much as I can work for this, it will happen; incidentally, we also have the new Colonial Office in Berlin, and so we can hope for the best. With this, our reporter had actually reached the end of his task. The conversation now took a different turn and turned to the northern parts of our protectorate, especially the Walsischdai. "How do you think the harbor question can best be solved?" asked our reporter. "The simplest thing would be to install landing facilities at the mouth of the Tswachaub River. The matter is perfectly possible, as the captain of a Wörmann steamer assured us. Not only would we have the advantage of having by far the best road into the interior, but the presence of sufficient fresh water in the riverbed would also favor the establishment of a settlement on the coast and Walsischbai would have to become in a very short time what it is by nature: a barren, waterless sand hole without any meaning. "And do you think it worth making such efforts to clear the entrance to Damaraland! ) certainly. Damaraland is the best part of our conservancy; above all, very healthy." . .. News from the Society. A committee meeting of the Society took place on October 7 under the chairmanship of Mr. Gebeimen Regierungsrat Simon in the Society's offices. The commission set up to investigate the question of the establishment of experimental stations in South West Africa gave a report. Bergrat Dr. Busse, who was present as a guest, took part in the committee's discussions. From the business reports it should also be mentioned that a department has been formed in Koblenz; the committee expressed its thanks to the gentlemen who have rendered outstanding services to the establishment of the department. Koblenz Branch. On October 3, a large number of gentlemen gathered at the Hotel Maiwald to discuss the formation of a department. Bergrat Dr. Busse opened the meeting

Page 267

and gave an overview of the nature and aims of the German Colonial Society. For the further development of the Society and the energetic pursuit of its aims, it was necessary for local groups and departments to be formed in all German cities. These should support the central leadership and help to ensure that the latter has a say in important issues. The speaker then examined the colonial movement, which was nothing other than an expression of national consciousness; if the German-English treaty had aroused unpleasant feelings, it had on the other hand had the good effect of stimulating a strong national movement; the more the English sought to inhibit it, the more vividly it would flare up, and we could not better counter English arrogance than by showing the English that they had provoked a great national movement in Germany. After the draft statutes had been read out, they were unanimously adopted on bloc. The following were elected to the board: District Commander Colonel Behm, District Administrator Count Brühl, Bergrat Dr. Busse, First Public Prosecutor Fischer, Court Bookseller Kindt, Government Councillor Middendorf, Divisional Pastor Montag, Lord Mayor Schüller, Commercial Councillor Spaeter, Court Assessor Trapet, former Senior Government Councillor Freiherr v. Vincke, Commercial Councillor Wegeler. Kommerzienrat Wegeler expressed the thanks of the meeting to Bergrat Dr. Busse, with lively approval from all sides, and at the same time his pleasure that such an energetic force had been gained for the movement, which he himself had already initiated years ago. Small announcements. (There are two reports on the massacre of the Germans in Witn, one by Mr. Frinz Häßler, one of the two survivors of Künzel's expedition, the other by Mr. Weiß, the official of the Witu=Gesellschaft. After that, the story of the drama is roughly as follows, although some points will always remain obscure. The members of the expedition landed in Mkonumbi (see the map "Deutsch=Wituland" in No. 49, 1888 of the "Deutsche Kolonialzeitung"), where a hut was built. The work of the Sägemüdle was to begin dei Utuani. On August 31, Küngel received permission to come to the Sultan, he set off there accompanied by Häßler and was received amicably by the Sultan, who, however, complained bitterly about the German-English agreement and no longer wanted to allow any other Eurodean to work in his country. He had not yet (September 2) received any official notification of the matter from the German Empire, but the English consular agent in Lamu, Simons, had been with him and informed him of the change in the protectorate. The gentlemen then returned to Mkonumbi and set about building a house, but they were prevented from doing so by the Mkonumbi people, who were allegedly ordered to do so by a letter from the Sultan, so that the situation was quite precarious. On September 11, however, Bana Homari was sent by the Sultan to create calm, and everything became peaceful again. On September 13, the workers went to Utuani to carry out the necessary felling for the foundation of the sawmill and Küntzel went to Witu again with Bana Homari to pay a visit to the Sultan. He had already met his workers there. Just as Meuschel and his companions were busy erecting the houses, around 300 soldiers had arrived and ordered them to stop work and turn back. They went, all well armed, with the askaris to Witn, where they received a sheep from the Sultan and were allowed to pass around freely, but were robbed of their weapons by a ruse. When Künzel arrived, the sultan ordered his sheep to be taken away from him too, but Homari vouched for him. When Küngzel wanted to leave the city gate, the gatekeepers tried to prevent him from doing so. A battle ensued in which Künzel was defeated by the superior force after he had fired his cartridges. The other unarmed Germans had forced their way through the gate, but were all cut down, with the exception of Meuschel, who escaped in the tall grass. The 16-year-old F. Horn, who had handed the cartridges to Küntzel, wriggled through the soldiers after he fell, but was pushed down by Wagalla in the Bara. The murderers then turned to Mkonumbi, lured the unsuspecting R. Horn out of his house and shot him down. When Häßler and Weiß had left, everything was destroyed by the Witu people. K. Toeppen visited the Sultan the next day, who had not yet buried the bodies of the murdered men and refused to allow them to be buried. The British and German missionaries went to the coast at the news of these events, and the Finnish missionary Hedenström saved his life by the skin of his teeth. So it seems that there is now complete anarchy in Witn, the party hostile to the Europeans has the upper hand, and England has a serious duty to avenge the murder of the Germans and establish order here. From what has been said, it is clear that the Sultan of Witu was playing a false game. The murder of the unarmed Germans makes matters worse; it was a barbaric act for which the Sultan and the murderers must be severely punished. We have shown the English how to deal with the ruthless and cruel Arabs and Suabelis; now it is their turn to assert their European superiority, if the German Empire is not to take retribution into its own hands. (The English) already feel threatened in their trade-political preponderance on Sansivar after the German-English agreement has barely been reached. The "Standard" reports from Zanzibar that the future there is very bleak. The fact that the German East African Society is moving its headquarters to Dar es Salaam on the coast and that a German steamer line is directly mediating the traffic between the "very rich towns" on the coast with "Eurova and the world" will divert the trade that has hitherto gone to Zanzibar from there. F. Moir, the director of the African Lakes Company, who was in Europe, also stated, as we read in the Pall Mall Gazette, that the Germans, in possession of the coast, would now try to make Zanzibar a lot. - With a certain Reid, they also approved of the Germans' work in Kaiser Wilhelmsland, as their territory was making no progress at all. The governor, Me Gregor, who knows the country best, has declared that the arable land is only sufficient for the needs of the natives, and is putting all kinds of obstacles in the way of the Europeans, whose cruelty towards the natives he knows. In the three northern provinces of Australia, which have to pay money to the governor at Port Moresby, as the annexation was only carried out on this condition, there is a very lively dissent. (The following has been officially established about the alleged insult to the German flag) by the Englishman Thomson: Thomson, agent of the British East African Company, some time ago mistakenly hoisted a German flag raised by its officials in the area near Witu belonging to the German East African Company. The Governor of the English Company, Francis de Winion, had Thomson punished as a result; both he and the English Consul General in Zanzibar have officially expressed their regret about this incident. The German Consul General, in agreement with the representation of the German East African Society in Zanzibar, considered the incident to be settled. (German East Africa.) The demand made by the Sultan of Zanzibar for the cession of the coastal strip amounts to 4 million marks; it is said that this sum is accepted by the German side as corresponding to the actual circumstances. Negotiations are still in progress as to how the sum is to be raised. The German-East African Company is reportedly prepared to pay the aforementioned amount, but is demanding recognition of the rights granted in the customs agreement and the other rights granted to it by the Sultan. The Supervisory Board, to which Mr. Sachse, Director of the Imperial Post Office, has also been elected, has already dealt with this question in detail. The meeting was also attended by br. Peters, who transferred to the company various concessions under private law that he had acquired in Africa. - There is still no exact information about the future employment of Major v. Wißmann, who intends to return to East Africa at the end of the month, but he will probably still have a large field of activity in the Great Lakes region. He is busily completing his work on the second crossing of Africa, which is soon to be published by Trowitzsch in Frankfurt. - Dr. Peters is also busy publishing a work on the Emin=Pasha expedition. On October 4, he gave a speech on the geography of the Tana region at the Society for Geography. (Dr. Büttner, a teacher at the Oriental Seminary, gave a lecture on the tasks of the merchant in the German colonies at a public meeting of the commercial section of the Young Men's Christian Association. The following is taken from a report in the Kreuzzeitung: From the very beginning, one of the leading ideas of the colonial movement was to create a field of activity, as well as to initiate an exchange of goods between the colonies and the mother country for mutual benefit, in order to free Germany from the obligation to pay tribute to the other colonial powers that had become rich as a result, namely Holland and England. The speaker outlined Germany's colonial possessions, regretting the losses now incurred as a result of the final diplomatic settlement, and then went on to highlight the sad fact that, now that German colonies of all kinds, including fertile and healthy ones, had been acquired, there was so little desire in Germany to exploit them. Big capital shows much more inclination to speculate in Turkey, Rumania, Argentina and other unsafe countries than in the German colonies, where even less intelligence and even less big capital goes. The Germans often suffer from the misconception that in order to get through in Africa one has to play "Wild=America" there, and those who have done so have sacrificed many human lives. In contrast, however, the missionary, the planter, the merchant and the laborer can all work peacefully in Africa. And the merchant in particular can enrich both himself and his fatherland through his work over there. He does not need weapons. He must not act like a robber chief, but he must enter into peaceful, trusting communication with the natives, equipped with education, diligence and knowledge of the language. There would be a rich and fruitful field for the activities of our educated youth, which are now often wasted in neck-breaking sports. Not every merchant needs to start with his own money; but everyone must have the necessary training to act as an efficient intermediary between producers and consumers over there in Africa, especially in East Africa. Above all, the merchant must study the raw materials that come from those countries. Now they are brought from all parts of the world to some European, of course not German, trading city in order to be shipped from there all over the world. There is a market for ostrich feathers in Antwerp, for example, as well as for ivory. Other raw materials go to London to be auctioned there, and when they come to us, they are of course subject to the customs duties of those countries that have a monopoly on trade. The merchant must seek to buy his rubber at the place of production and must find new producing countries. He must discover the usefulness and merchantability of previously unused materials and be able to place them on the market. In the past, all gum arabic was sourced from eastern Sudan. Now it has been discovered that this gum grows wild throughout Africa.

Page 268

 and so there are still many raw materials lying around that are only waiting for the eye of the commercially educated explorer; for the scholar, the missionary, the explorer sees things, but he never or only rarely looks at them with regard to their usability in trade. When the demand for such a raw material arises, it is also collected by the Negroes and later cultivated. The blacks are just as happy to work as our farmhands and laborers. They do not work when they see that nothing comes of it. They work when they can eat their wages in safety and security. Above all, the speaker emphasizes the necessity of sufficient language skills for the merchant, both for those who travel the countries independently, for example, and for the employee. He condemns the experiment on the basis of the facts: to stimulate trade by inducing the Negro to drink schnapps. Where this had been tried, the consequences had been unfavorable not only for the Negro, but also for the merchant and for trade as a whole. Where alcohol was introduced and played a role, a gap remained between the Europeans and the natives. The frontier tribes then took over the trade and made the goods more expensive. The best example of how trade with the natives of Africa should be conducted was provided by the Arabs, who crossed Africa much earlier than the Europeans without much fuss and at least in part without violence. The people who travel in Africa on business do not write books about it, because they have no interest in increasing their competition. But those who, armed to the teeth, terrify the natives and then have to force them to deliver food by force of arms, write great books about their exploits. No native will harm the peaceful merchant who comes without weapons. He needs him, he knows that he is useful to him. Up to now, only the Kraber and Jndians have become rich in East Africa through trade mediation. All the more reason for European merchants, who are superior to them in intelligence and knowledge, to have the prospect of making a fortune there. The Seminar for Oriental Languages offers a good opportunity to acquire the necessary language skills here. Several chambers of commerce have set up scholarships which provide ample support for students. Finally, the lecturer recommended absolute honesty in trade as a necessary precondition for a prosperous relationship with the natives and concluded to lively applause. Literature. Les Colonles Françalses. Notices illustrées, publiées par ordre du soussécrétaire d'état des colonies sous la direction de Nr. Louis Henrique II-IV. Paris, Maison Quantin. In the present three volumes we have the continuation of the first volume of the French colonies discussed in No. 5 of our newspaper of this year. The second volume contains the French colonies of America, the third the Indochinese colonies and protectorates, the fourth those of the quiet Ojean. The other colonies of the French Empire are treated in the same excellent manner as in the first volume; they are accompanied by neatly executed maps and illustrations. At the end of each colony there is a bibliography of it, which adds to the value of this work. In the fifth volume, which we have not yet received, the African possessions of France are presented and we would like to draw the attention of all friends of colonial literature to this volume. Br. entrances for the library. Given the limited space we have for book reviews, it will not be possible to discuss all works in detail, but we never fail to recommend new colonial writings that are assigned to our library by the authors and publishers to colonial friends in word and deed, for which the administration of the library is given ample opportunity by our members. Once again, we would like to express our sincere thanks for the books donated to our library. Receipts in October. Baunsarten, De. J.

Appeal: Wißmann, supported by our navy, has put down the uprising in German East Africa with a clear view and a firm hand and returned the coastal area to peaceful cultural work. The task now is to develop the German night as far as the great inner-African lakes, where Emin, together with Wißmann, wants to open up new sources of help for German business life. As the most important step in this direction, Wißmann demands German steamships on these lakes. The steamers should strengthen the reputation of the German flag, which Wißmann, Peters and Emin have carried into the innermost part of the dark continent, and give protection and support to the vigorously developing branches of the Christian missions on the lakes in order to break the onslaught of Jslam that threatens them. We must demand the development of German trade on the lakes, give German merchants the upper hand over natives and Europeans in their territory and open up new sales channels for national industry. Let us thank the Reichskommissar in deed by fulfilling his selfless wish and enabling him to achieve new successes for the Fatherland in this great task! Let us show that the German people are serious about their cultural work in Africa by making sacrificial donations for the steamships to be procured! Then the work of the fathers will be the blessing of the sons there too. Contributions are accepted by the German Colonial Society, Berlin W., Linkstraße 25. German Colonial Society. The Portuguese and the English. (With Karie. The tension which has arisen between the Portuguese and the English as a result of the well-known events on the Zambezi has reached a height which foreshadows a crisis if an understanding acceptable to both parties cannot be reached at the last moment: for from day to day the Portuguese see themselves more and more forced back from the territories to which they have undoubted rights, and exposed to rape on the part of England. England, which is today more than ever at the zenith of its power and, as circumstances have shown, knows how to deal with much more powerful opponents than Portugal by means of a very skillful policy. England had not yet left the path of diplomatic negotiations (although she had emphasized her wishes by a naval demonstration), but by ruthlessly exploiting Portugal's weakness she had managed to agree on a convention which considerably limited her possessions in East Africa. By this convention Great Britain recognized the Portuguese territory south of the Rovuma, as defined in the German-Portuguese treaty of 1886. The Portuguese possessions in East Africa are then limited in the north from the Rovuma River to its confluence with the M'Sinje and from there westwards through the same latitudinal parallel to Lake Nyassa. The border then follows the shore of the lake southwards to 3½ degrees south latitude and from there in a direct line southwards to Lake Kilwa. Following the eastern shore of this lake to its extreme south-eastern point, the boundary draws a direct line from there to the eastern tributary of the Ruo (at about longitude 16°), follows the Ruo westwards to its confluence with the Shire and turns in a direct line to the Zambezi, which it touches at a point between the Karoa Bassa Rapids and Tete. The south-eastern and southern shores of Lake Nyassa, the Shire Highlands, Blantyre and the surrounding area have therefore fallen to Great Britain. The border then follows the Zambezi up to a point 10 English miles west of Sumbo. There it leaves the Zambezi and strikes a line directly south to latitude 16°, follows this parallel eastwards to longitude 31° and from there runs in a straight line to the intersection of the Mazoe River with longitude 33°, which it follows forwards to latitude 18½° and then follows the latter parallel westwards until it reaches the Mashike') at its confluence with the Sava. The border then runs along the course of the latter river southwards to its confluence with the Lundi. From this point it follows a straight line to the southwest to the northeast corner of the Transvaal border. It follows the border of the Transvaal and Swafiland southwards to the Maputa River and from there the latitudinal parallel of the confluence of the Maputa with the Pongolo eastwards to the sea. By virtue of a special stipulation, Portugal is assigned territory for a distance of 10 miles around Sumbo on the northern bank of the Zambezi. As far as western Africa is concerned, the boundary between the Portuguese and British spheres of influence runs from the Katima Rapids on the Zambezi along this river to its confluence with the Kabompo and then follows the latter river northwards to the border of the Congo Free State. It is agreed that Great Britain does not object to the extension of the Portuguese sphere of influence eastwards from the Loanda border to the western border of the Congo Free State, an area of 400,000 square kilometers, and recognizes as Portuguese territory the hinterland of Angola from the border where the rivers run north and south (approximately in the 11½ parallel of latitude) to the northern border of the German sphere. Great Britain, for its part, is to have a clear path between its northern and its *) The following map is based on English and Portuguese sources. The hydrography of the area south of Sambest is so unclear in the interior that only the approximate position of the river courses can be shown.

 southern sphere of influence in Africa. In fact, everything west of Lake Nyassa is British territory. However, Portugal reserves the right to maintain a connection between its eastern and western territories along the Zambezi. For this purpose it is granted the right to construct roads, railroads and telegraph lines within a line drawn 10 miles from the southern bank and 20 miles from the northern bank of the Zambezi, forming a belt of land 30 miles wide. On the other hand, Great Britain reserves the right to lay out railroads, roads, etc., between the north-eastern corner of her sphere of influence south of the Zambezi to a point between the Mazoe and the Karoa Bassa Rapids on the Zambezi in a belt of land 10 miles wide. The Zambezi and its tributaries shall be freely open to the flags of all rations, and all waterways in the British and Portuguese spheres of influence in the whole area defined by the present Convention shall be freely open to navigation by the flags of both countries. In the case of any cession of territory which Portugal may be induced to make, the Government of Great Britain shall be accorded a preferential right. All differences which may arise between the two Governments in their respective spheres of influence shall be settled by arbitration. The transit duties imposed by Portugal on goods passing through Portuguese territory between the British sphere of influence in East Africa and the sea shall not exceed the duties fixed by the Portuguese tariff in 1877, namely 3 percent ad valorem. The convention also included a number of other stipulations concerning customs duties, but to list them here would take us too far. These are, by and large, the terms of the convention, which no Portuguese minister has yet had the courage to recommend to the Cortes for acceptance without reservation. For, as a glance at the map shows, this convention has made Portugal completely dependent on England as far as East Africa is concerned; England controls the hinterland, the Zambezi, and the distance from the English country south of the Zambezi to the coast is so short that exports and imports must naturally take their route via the southern ports of the territory that has remained Portuguese, namely Sofala: that the southern ports will be developed by the English, who are strong in capital, and not by the weak Portuguese. The consequence of this agreement will be that the English will push the Portuguese out of the country south of the Zambezi, as it will be only too easy for them to use the old tactics again after a few years and demand that either one or the other port becomes English or that they are allowed to create new facilities. While north of the Sambest the African Lakes Company and the missions were sent forward to do the work for England, the South African Company is active in the same sense south of the river. Their expedition reached Monnt Hampden without being attacked by the Matabeles and established a fortified station in an area that is described as fertile and rich in gold. From the Bechnanaland plateau to this point, a path will be laid out and fortified stations will be built, as the Matabeles are not to be trusted in any way. But Lobengula has so far been able to hold back his deutelusting warriors and the English have nothing to fear from the Maschonas, who were often easy prey for the Matabele in the past. Only time will tell whether the land between the Zambezi and Limpopo is as rich in gold*) as is generally believed, *) The following description is given in The Times of the famous ruins on the Simbabye, which were visited en route: The cuins are situated at the foot of a steep granite hill, a so-called "kopje", and are inhabited by a Mashona tribe under a chief Moghalt. If you approach the kopje, you will first notice an outer rampart about four feet high, which apparently runs around the whole kopje, but could not be followed for more than half a mile because of the high grave and dense, overgrown undergrowth. Then there are signs of a second inner rampart, which was impossible to follow for the reasons mentioned. Then, under a perfect labyrinth of remains of small round buildings - a mighty accumulation, but apparently based on a certain plan, to the southwest of the head and 300 yards from its base - we stand before the surprising and characteristic ruins - a round rampart 30 to 35 feet high, which completely encloses a space of 80 yards in diameter. This rampart (about 10 feet thick at the base and 7 or 8 feet at the crown) is built of small granite blocks about twice the size of an ordinary brick. The stones are beautifully carved and prepared, lie very regularly and are stacked on top of each other without mortar or cement. Although this building is very difficult to examine because of the dense undergrowth and lush vegetation and close to the entrance and outer rampart, judging by the reports of the correspondents, it seems to be fertile and a desirable destination for the emigration of enterprising Englishmen who are engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry. One reporter even speaks quite enthusiastically of "infinite sources of agricultural aid", but whether there is more to it than an advertisement to boost the shares of English society is yet to be decided. Whatever the circumstances, the country certainly has a future and will soon be easily accessible from the south, as the railroad from Kimberley to Mafeking is under construction. But it will be mainly dependent on the connection with the north and east, and in the Times it is already indicated that routes must be opened for carriers to the Zambezi or the east coast, although in the latter case it would be necessary to deal with the Port giants, which would have its difficulties. The shortest route is of course the latter, and even if it leads through steppes, England will certainly find ways and means to create a suitable exit here if the area develops. Considering these things, one can go even further and even say that the policy of South Africa, especially of the now predominant Cape country, will be reshaped by the occupation of the Matebele country. For the transportation of ice submarines from Cape Town to the northern shore of the Limpopo and beyond will make the necessary import products so expensive and the export so difficult that the population of Matabeleland will have to seek a port on the southern coast and thus break the predominance of Cape Town." The Portuguese, who had neglected to counter the English on the Zambezi, saw the great danger to their subaltern possessions approaching and hastened to send troops to the Manica region, a land rich in gold since the Middle Ages, whose treasures had been discovered via Sofala. It remains to be seen whether they arrived there, but in any case the commander of the English company has provoked a new dispute by concluding treaties with a Mutassa chief whose residence lies within the zone granted to the Portuguese by the treaty. The Prime Minister of the Cape Colony, who is also the President of the Company, motivated the leader of the expeditionary force by saying that the convention had not yet been concluded! But while the Portuguese are only threatened with a serious danger to their southern coast by the continuing development of Matabel Land, the English, this time regarding the convention as already universally approved, have forced the entry of their warships into the Zambezi. English ships had long been searching for a navigable mouth of the Zambezi in order to avoid the customs house at Quelimane, and Rankin had succeeded in finding the navigable Chinde Arm. The English then had the gunboats described earlier in the colonial newspaper built at Parrow, steamers equipped with a rear wheel, which were dismantled and taken to the mouth of the Zambezi. When the Portuguese military force in Mozambique apparently proved too weak to subdue the rebellious Lieutenant Coutinho, the English no longer hesitated; they put the steamers together and sailed up the Zambezi on October 8th with many loaded boats in tow (without paying customs duties, of course) despite the protests of the Portuguese. This was Portugal's greatest humiliation, and may it be its last. For the English should remember that a day of reckoning must come. 30 feet high, stands a conical tower 35 feet high, 18 feet in diameter at the bastion, built of the same granite blocks in a solid manner. Finally, a characteristic feature of this rampart is that about 20 feet from its base, a double wall zigzags around about a third of its circumference. On the kopje and ashange of the hill there are numerous ruins of a similar character: round buildings wedged between blocks of stone and at least nine terraces surrounded by ramparts. On the top, however, there is a huge house of granite blocks, apparently used as a fork, which, due to the absence of atmospheric destructive influences in this climate, are in an almost complete state of preservation. The view from the Soizder Kopje is of a beauty that is probably unsurpassed in South Africa. A counterpart can perhaps be found in the Marito district in Transvas, which is usually regarded as the pearl of such Szeuerians. The mystery of these ruins has not been solved even by the members of the expedition, who have been gazing at the remains of a prehistoric era, which are magnificent in their massiveness. The Vanguard giants even intend to build a railroad along the Rio Ponqwe to Maniea. D. R.

 The labor question in Oslafrika. The question has been raised on various occasions as to the state of labor conditions in German East Africa, whether the Negro in the interior of our territory, whether the coastal Reger can be permanently used for manual labor in plantation construction. Opinions differ, some observers deny the Reger, especially the Bantuneger, any endurance for plantation work, while others assume that the Reger can generally be encouraged to work through good example, good treatment and appropriate payment, as has already been shown in German East Africa. Recently, Mr. Eugen Wolf, Wißmann's former commercial advisor, has commented on the question, which he would like to submit for discussion from a "competent" side. We reproduce his article published in the Kölnische Volkszeitung: "Zum Instandhalten von Tabak-, Kaffee=, Indigo=, Vanille= u. s. w.. For the maintenance of tobacco, coffee, indigo, vanilla, etc. plantations, i.e. plants and shrubs that are cultivated at certain regular intervals and treated uniformly on average, the rake, once trained, will do his duty well under the supervision of a white man. I have seen Negroes working on the west coast of Africa in Senegal, in German territory, in Liberia (Woermann's cash plantations), in Dahome, Gabon, Congo, etc., as well as on the east coast in Madagascar, Comoros and Mrima Negroes, both on larger plantations and smaller shambas as well as in large gardens belonging either to Catholic missions or private individuals. Everywhere one could see how conscientiously the once-trained rake (of the various tribes as mentioned above) carried out his work. I only have to mention the gardens of the Catholic mission in Ague (Kingdom of Dabome) under the direction of the prefect Fr. Menager, the gardens of the Catholic mission in Landana (Congo) under the direction of Fr. Carriöre and the magnificent fruit and vegetable park of the Catholic mission in Bagamoyo. Apart from the potatoes, peas, beans, spinach, sorrel, lettuce, romaine, radishes, radishes, cucumbers, turnips, carrots, not to mention the many eastern trees - all planted and watered by Negroes - the abundance of ornamental shrubs, flowers and nut-bearing plants, such as vanilla, was quite astonishing when you first entered this large garden. Anyone who has ever been to this garden will confirm it: there are fresh vegetables and fruit all year round. And that in Bagamevo, right on the seashore, in Bagamoyo, which is so much maligned because of its heat and sand. If the Negro wants to work, he can. and this raises the important question: Is the Negro to be used in the first establishment of extensive plantations of larger companies/ Will it not take a very long time until sufficient field workers have been gathered for larger undertakings, and will not the raider, until he has seen good examples before him, be too indolent, for example, if he earns little, take his wages just at the important moment (e.g. during the fermentation of tobacco) and surrender to the dolco sar niento! Is this not a danger in the establishment of plantations! I would like to see this important question discussed by a competent party; the answer to it is highly desirable for the capitalist, especially now that German capital is turning more and more to East African plantations. In my opinion, one should, 1. to set a good example to the coastal negroes; 2. to show them that one is not absolutely dependent on them; 3. for safety's sake, in the first years on new plantations, and also for other, but only scientific reasons, make an experiment with the Chinese right from the beginning of the new colonization era. I am familiar with the achievements of the Chinese Kutis from my travels in California, Colorado. Texas, Mexico, etc. in northern America; I have also encountered them as miners on my travels in Pern, Bolivia and partly in Chile. The Chinese have the following advantages: they never drink spirituous liquors, they are moderate in all things and unpretentious. On average, he is very honest, conscientious and hard-working, and works tirelessly from morning to night, even without supervision. It acclimatizes very quickly everywhere. There is probably no better worker for plantations than the Chinese. In our colonies, he can immediately satisfy his small physical needs - rice and nothing but rice - through Andau. The Chinese always lives in isolation and only with his fellow countrymen. He will therefore not exert a detrimental influence - in the sense of morality in his domesticity, insofar as such accusations are justified at all - on the natives. The Chinese pen is relatively easy to obtain. It can now be brought directly from Chinese ports to our East African possessions without transshipment and with German steamers. The transportation does not cost very much for a contract, say for five hundred Chinese at a time. From such a number one would also recruit a lot of good carpenters, boatmen, blacksmiths, washermen, cooks, etc. for the individual stations. They are also extremely reliable as harbor, customs and plantation police, and should be limited to an initial import of 500 men, spread over five or ten stations or plantations. It will soon become clear what the Chinese on Tadak, cotton, coffee, cocoa, vanilla, rice and jndigo plantations achieve in relation to one or more natives. I will not even mention opium cultivation, from which England receives enormous annual sums from Jndia. This would probably be a source of wealth for us; but opium cultivation also has its great mineral concerns. We should leave it at this one experiment until it becomes clear what equivalent the Chinese will make in East Africa in relation to the cost of procurement, travel, settlement and wages, how the mortality rates etc. will develop. I also know of examples where Chinese have married Negro women and vice versa; however, the question of racial mixing would take me too far afield. This would also open up a wider field in Africa for our missionary institutions. That Chinese can also become good Christians can be seen in our country, where a number of people from the heavenly realm have converted to Christianity Our neighbors in East Africa, the English, also seem to want to beat us to the workers' question. Last year, when I traveled from Sansidar to Bombay on behalf of Major von Wißmann and as his commercial advisor in order to take care of business matters for our protection force there, I learned from the most reliable source that the British Imperial East African Company was recruiting large troops of Indian coolies for its plantation, port and railroad constructions. These have also left for Mombaja in regular transports of 50-150 men, and with these people they are building their railroad, the first spadeful of which has probably surprised us Germans in general, but not the insiders. I believe that the calm, orderly working methods of the Chinese, his perseverance, his diligence and his restraint can only contribute favorably to the agricultural development of East Africa. The German capitalist, however, who will entrust his money to foreign hands in distant regions, will thus achieve the goal of his and the entire German nation's wishes more quickly: "To draw rich fruits from our German East African colonies! C. Eng. Wolf. We contrast this omission with the following correspondence, which we received from Pretoria on August 8, whereby we only wish to note that there is no actual labor issue in the Transvaal: the struggle against the Asians. Since complaints have often been made in Natal and also in the Cape Colony in order to prevent the further influx of coolies and Chinese, and the Orange Free State has also recently been prompted to restrict the influx of coolies by means of strict laws, several Pretorians for their part have tried to counter the influx of Chinese and coolies in the last week, and for this purpose a meeting was announced for Saturday, August 2 in the evening. To this end, a meeting was announced for the evening of Saturday, August 2, to discuss how further influxes could be stopped. After various speeches, all of which more or less stated that according to the English-Transvaal agreement, the Culis, as English subjects, could not be prohibited from immigrating, the decision was made to found branch associations of this Anti-Asian Union in all larger places, and to send an address with many signatures to the Queen of England, with the request for the abolition of this clause In addition, the Transvaal government was to receive support in dealing with this question through this association. Strangely enough, it was mostly English subjects who attended this meeting and emphasized that Australia was an English colony and yet had been able to prevent the influx of Chinese into Australia despite all of England's objections, but that Transvaal was a free republic, so if the petition to the Queen of England was not granted, the free republic of Transvaal could take the law into its own hands just as well and even better than Australia, which was dependent on England. Trausvaal would then be able to cut off further influxes itself due to its independent position. This general South African anti-Asian movement, however, should probably also be taken into account by Germany with regard to the German colonies, so that the basic evil of Aufang can be controlled and difficulties can arise, as they have already arisen throughout South Africa, difficulties that have become almost insurmountable. In any case, the German colonies should strive for what they are now striving for everywhere in South Africa, that all colored nations should be placed equally under the natives. Indeed, the children of the country should even be given preference over other colored people who immigrate only to exploit the country, damage the trade of Europeans and use means that are by no means legal. The wealth collected by the Chinese in the colonies does not remain in the colony after all. But one must not be guided by humanitarian principles alone when the welfare of the country is in question. In Natal, the situation is such that the Kaffirs, who form the overwhelming majority of the population, do not work for the Europeans, forcing them to import foreign labor. That the Swahili will remain in the same seclusion from the Europeans as the Zulu is not to be assumed in view of his mixed-blood character, but whether he will work regularly is an open question. Mr. Wolf's only advice is to make an attempt to clarify the question for East Africa, to dare something rather than to remain in fearful consideration.

Employment prospects for Germans in East Africa.") It seems well known from the outset that mass emigration to our eastern colony is impossible at present, perhaps forever. It is true that in the stations on the coast (Tanga, Mquaja, Pangani, Saadani, Bagamoyo, Mbueni, Dar=es=Salaam, Kiloa, Lindi and Mikindani) the climatic conditions do not constitute an obstacle to the settlement of Europeans. But even here, only certain professions can find permanent and rewarding work. We cannot live like the savages, who are satisfied if they have what we call a doghouse as a dwelling, a rag of linen for clothing and a little millet, bananas and a few fish, together worth 10 Pf. as food for themselves and their families. Mass emigration to a colony always presupposes a favorable climate, cheap living conditions, fertile soil, good water and good roads. All of this is in short supply there. A German family that emigrated to East Africa with a few hundred Reichsmarks would have to starve. There are only very specific professions that I have in mind if I want to open up a favorable perspective for them to work in East Africa now: above all craftsmen, in some time also farmers and - to a certain extent - merchants. The journey out is already expensive, the adult pays about 300 marks for steerage, apart from equipment, land travel, and so on. But then the emigrant also needs a sum to keep his head above water for the first few months over there, to settle in and settle down. He will certainly have a lot of bad experiences at first, earnings will only come gradually and all food is plentiful there, but also very expensive. Apart from a small capital, it is desirable for obvious reasons that the person concerned has served with a weapon. Even if peaceful conditions prevail at the moment, we must always bear in mind that the war years are only just behind us and that many an uprising from within or without by the slave hunters, the Arabs and the wild tribes, whose main source of income has been disrupted by us, is still to come. It is always good, indeed necessary, if one knows how to participate or defend oneself. Finally, everyone who goes out is advised to take as much practical knowledge with them as possible. It is not enough to be well versed in a single subject, and you would certainly be able to make a living in it quickly and securely at home if it were not for the annoying competition. There is no such competition over there, but there are not so many customers for the one article that you can get by on that alone without worry. Rather, you have to be fair in as many saddles as possible over there, you can never know in advance where the need and strong demand will be at the time of arrival. It is therefore advisable, for example, to be a carpenter as well as a gardener and, in addition to the art of making your neighbor's face smooth and his hair fit well, to also be a healer, washerman, shoemaker and the like. The frugal and practically-minded European is particularly fortunate over there, not only can he soon create a secure existence for himself, but he can also provide invaluable services to many others The most promising professions in East Africa at present are: mechanic, carpenter, blacksmith, shoemaker, gardener or plantation farmer, barber, washerman. I would like to illustrate this with examples. It annoyed me every time I had to put myself in the hands of one of the dirty Indians to have my hair or beard groomed. When shaving, one involuntarily thinks that it must be a special pleasure for such hallunks (if I may say so) to cut off one's neck instead of the superfluous beard growth. We refer here to the article by Mr. v. Hake, "German Urban Colonization" in No. 2, 1890, as the view expressed in this article coincides in many respects with that expressed earlier. Emigration to East Africa is, of course, only possible under certain circumstances; firstly, a particularly good physical constitution is required, but then the person concerned must be in contact with the Schutztruppe and have a small capital at his disposal, otherwise he will fall prey to misery there. So if we grant this article acceptance, we also want to warn against rash emigration to East Africa. The ed.
Even happy if you have anyone at all, but it is a lot of money, even by oriental standards, if you have to pay 75 Pf. for every shave and 1 Mark 50 Pf. for every haircut, according to the usual rate! And what's more, these barbers perhaps know how to treat their peers, but the Germans are used to something different. It is a wonderful thing for the Germans in Zanzibar that there are no carpenters, watchmakers or shoemakers in this town of more than 90000 inhabitants. It is true that during the last part of my stay (at the beginning of this year) a trader appeared who sold finished wooden goods and was also able to carry out some minor repairs, but anyone wanting a larger piece of household equipment, a cupboard, an armchair or the like still has to turn to one of the captains of the Sultan's steamer to take an order to Bombay, the nearest Europeanized trading centre. What has been said of Zanzibar applies to an even greater extent to the German towns and stations on the coast, especially the larger ones such as Bagamoyo, Pangani, Tanga, Dar-es=Salaam, Kiloa and Lindi. Each of the above-mentioned craftsmen would be able to count on the most benevolent approach and the most effective support from both the station chief and the Europeans in general. Moreover, these are already impressive settlements with a population of around 10,000 or even 15,000, and they are currently in the process of building houses, laying out gardens, establishing plantations, and generally becoming watchtowers. There is certainly no lack of work there, and at least one thing is true of East Africa: the work is well paid. I could multiply the above examples from my own experience. An ordinary suitcase was not available either on the island or at one of the stations, so there was nothing left to do but turn to the headquarters of the French missionary branch in Bagamoyo. And it was only thanks to the constant and proven friendliness of the Frères that a very useful suitcase was soon produced in their workshops for 10 rupees (about 14 marks), which would otherwise have had to be sent from Bombay for double or triple the price. But the worst thing was always the washerman. In Bagamoyo, a town of over 20,000 inhabitants, there is a washerman (dobi), who is of course an Indian and exhibits their usual impertinence, slowness and disorder. When we entrusted this gentleman with our linen garments and clothes, which often needed changing in the tropics, we either got back only half of our own and several pieces of other people's clothes or at least a third in such a state that our housewives risked a mild fainting fit at the sight. And there was nothing to be done! The Dodi was a Portuguese subject - therefore to be handled with glacé gloves; However, I heard from an acquaintance that he had once blued the Indian's back in private when he saw him walking around in his best skirt quite harmlessly As far as the shoemaker is concerned, it should only be mentioned that there is no such artist in East Africa who makes European footwear, if you are burned out in terms of footwear - which happens very easily over there, then you must either try to give an acquaintance who has brought a sufficient supply from Cleija (Europe) such a pitiful description of your misery that he gives up a pair of his treasures with a sour face or you must be so lucky as to appear at the Soupas (the main Indian firms in Zanzibar) just at the moment when the shipment of boots arrives from Bombay. The prices are extremely high and the shelf life is extremely short. Last but not least, the mechanic, especially if he is also a watchmaker, is in the right place. From the above, it is clear enough what is lacking in East Africa and how far righteous German craftsmanship has a golden ground there. The author is serious about what he is saying here. Even in the interest of my compatriots over there, I wish that the great calamity in so many simple things would soon come to an end, and that a new, real and promising field would arise for our surplus labor The simple bricklayer, laborer or day laborer is not so much in need over there, the native is an excellent worker if the white man has the necessary discipline and uniformity. To be the latter, however, is more or less a matter of speculation over there as well, and as much as it is to be hoped that a good, practical hotel, such as is so sorely lacking in Zanzibar, will soon open in Bagamoyo or Dar es Salaam, just as little can be said in general about the

Page 274

 The farmer and the merchant are another matter. It is a different matter with the farmer and merchant. The attempts at plantation cultivation that were made before the uprising are being resumed to a greater extent with energy and commendable zeal, and it is also to be hoped that the large German companies, which have had their headquarters in Sansidar up to now, will take account of the changed circumstances and turn their attention to increasing trade in the German areas. Above all, however, it is also to be hoped that national big business will become more involved in promoting trade and plantation building in our East African colony, contribute more to the costs of establishing suitable and necessary transportation routes, such as the procurement of steamships on the large inland lakes, the construction of a Bagamoyo-Dar=es=Salaam railroad line and the like, in other words, be more willing to make sacrifices. At present, the small trader has the least prospects and hopes, as it would be difficult for him to compete with the industrious and needless Indians who make up the retailers of the coastal towns. I once asked one of the poorest representatives of this race on a trip to the dhows how much net profit he made from his small general store in Bagamoyo each month. He replied: 50 rupees (about 70 marks), and I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of his answer after having seen the store and the business for myself. Of course, no European would be able to exist in such primitive living, eating and clothing conditions as that Indian. Nor is the sales area in Africa as simple as one might think. It is astonishing when - as recently in April of this year - a consortium of German traders appears in Zanzibar in order to establish themselves in one place on the coast with - mirrors! Even if the East African is quite vain, this fact is well enough known to bring to light a whole stock of glasses and mirrors at low prices in almost every Indian store on the coast. At present, East Africa offers the most favorable prospects to the wholesaler, the plantation owner and the skilled German craftsman. Dr. F. Frhr. v. Rettelbladt. Cameroonian. As it is the intention of this series of articles to report on the exploratory journeys in the hinterland of Cameroon, we must not forget the brilliant successes of recent times, even if they took place some years ago. The least to be ignored is a journey that was undertaken four decades ago from the north, more precisely from Kuka to Adamana, which today belongs to the German sphere of influence. It is the expedition of our famous compatriot Dr. Heinrich Barth, who in the spring of 1851 visited the large western Sudanese depression around Lake Chad, which has no outlet, and who saw these areas as his special field of study. Barth and a second German scholar, Dr. Overweg, had come to Central Africa as companions of the English journalist Richardson. Richardson had already made a name for himself in 1845/46 through his travels to Mursuk, Ghadames and Rhat. Based on his experiences at the time, he was able to present his government with a plan for a new expedition in 1849, which was to penetrate the desert to Sudan in order to establish trade relations with the central Ethiopian states and suppress the slave trade. Richardson died before he reached Kuka; the fact that his enterprise was nevertheless so immensely fruitful for science is to the credit of his German companions, above all Bartho; for Overweg also sank into his grave barely a year and a half after the leader. Since then the work has rested solely on the shoulders of our Barth, and during his stay in the dark part of the world he has, with rare skill and never tiring perseverance, opened up areas that were previously hardly known by name. The following sketch of the expedition to Jola, which also led to the discovery of Benus, will briefly familiarize us with the results of this memorable journey. After a great deal of preparatory work and preparation, Barth's small caravan left the walls of Kuka on May 29, 1851 to set off on the perilous *) Our report is based on the second volume of "Reisen und Entdeckungen in Nord= und Zeutral=Afrika in den Jahren 1849 dis 1855 von Dr. Heinrich Barth. Diary of his journey undertaken on behalf of the Third Government". Gotha, Justus Perthes. 1857.
March to the south. Dr. Overweg accompanied his compatriot for some distance, while an officer appointed by Sheikh Omar, named Billama, was assigned to our explorer as his official companion for the duration of the journey. Leaving the road to Ngornu on Lake Chad to the left, Barth's troop hurried straight ahead. The area soon became prettier, showing abundant grass growth with individual tamarind trees, until later those shallow, dark-ground depressions emerged which are only noticeable in the dry season and which the natives call "firki" and the Arabs "ghadir". These basins form large ponds during the rainy season, but when the water recedes afterwards, they contain the most excellent arable soil, on which excellent crops thrive. Once the fruit has been harvested, the depressions, which are often of considerable size, lie completely "naked and desolate, without herbs or shrubs, and present a most unpleasant sight". Immigrant Arabs, who have been known in Bornu by the generic name "Shua" since time immemorial, had settled along the path. They undoubtedly come from the east and slowly made their way into this distant zone about 300 years ago as peaceful cattle herders. They usually live in permanent villages, cultivate the fields during the rainy months and move nomadically through the country with their herds during the dry season. The area was rich in huntable animals, giraffes, wild boar and all kinds of birds. Cotton plantations could be seen, and on both sides of the road there were cornfields that had been planted. The population even proved to be not inexperienced in some trades. The favorable impression increased even more when the expedition entered the most beautiful district of Bornu, the land of Udsche. Villages, often of considerable size, were scattered around the area, and almost every place had its own market. The central point, however, seemed to be in Udsche-Kassukula, where trade was very lively. The soil around revealed a high cultural value; baobabs, figs and a host of smaller trees covered the fertile soil in the uncultivated areas. A summer-dry rain river or Komädugu wound its way through the area in a clear bed, framed now and then by moderate steep banks, along which small indigo plantations occasionally appeared. Barth accompanied the rivulet as far as the capital of the district, after which he took a purely southerly route through the border landscape of the Marghi. The garden-like meadows soon gave way to a barren bush region, which was followed by a narrow strip of farmland until the great forest began on June 6, which continued four days' journey in a midday direction. Even in the near past, this thicket had been relatively heavily populated: Traces of earlier culture, remnants of villages and huts often presented themselves to the eye and gave evidence of the oppression to which this unfortunate area had fallen victim. The sparse inhabitants, belonging to the Marghi tribe, surprised us with their beauty and regularity of form. The majority of them were still pagans and worshipped their idols in the darkness of the forest under sacred trees. The Iolam had made few proselytes at the time. Despite their rather puffy lips and frizzy hair, some people almost completely lacked the distinct Negro type; in addition, the color of their skin varied in the most diverse shades, from shiny black to a light rhadarber or copper tone. Where clothing was worn, this could be safely attributed to the influence of Mohammedanism. Complete nudity, especially among the female sex, always heralded paganism. In the meantime, the terrain rose a little more; from an isolated granite hilltop near Issege, a first view to the west of the border mountains of the small Wandala district became possible, whose initially low peaks rose noticeably towards the south. Dr. Barth recognized the mountain Mendesi or Mendif, which "has become so famous in Europe since it was first seen by Major Denham on his adventurous venture against some Fellata settlements. Even now, as well as later on his return, Barth was able to gather a lot of interesting information about the Mendif and its neighboring peaks, and he still found time to complete a true-to-life sketch of the double peak itself for his travel work. In Kofa, which had previously belonged entirely to Bornu, Sheikh Omar's rule had already come to an end. The inhabitants were under the protection of the Fulde and lived in better conditions than the previously touched pagans, who had been decimated by slave hunts. From the eastern hills, a number of small gullies flowed towards a wide Komädugu, which divides the terrain here and finally flows into Lake Chad. The watershed against the Benus ran a little further along at Uda and, according to Barth's investigations, may have been 600 meters high here. The caravan reached the southern slope of the mountain ridge through a rough pass strewn with granite boulders, in which a tree used for making arrow poison grew, and

Page 275

into a new broad cultural zone. In the background, a mountain range with many peaks rose about 800 feet above the valley floor, while nearby the northernmost urban settlement of the Fulbe on this side, the hospitable Uba, opened its gates. Thus Barth had happily gained the border of Adamaua; he stood at the gates of that peculiar "Mohammedan kingdom" which the bold and sanatic chief Adama had "grafted" onto a diverse array of pagan tribes barely an age earlier. To the west, roughly parallel to the chain of Wändala, another significant swelling now appeared, crowned by the peaks of Kiria, Fingting, Ba and Jaurogudde. A lively little river with clear water accompanied the travelers to Mubi, where they found the best reception. The town lord himself came out on horseback to invite Barth into his house. The rich pastureland around the village was conducive to productive cattle breeding; the village of Bagma, for example, was populated by large herds of cattle, for which spacious stables had been built to protect them from the inclement weather. As the locals claimed, no camel had come down their road for 15 years; so now everyone flocked from near and far to see this miracle, and they marveled at the strange desert animal even more than the strange white man. The people of the district continued to behave in a courteous and friendly manner in the scenery of their area, but the green fields and meadows soon alternated with rough rocky outcrops and deserted wilderness. Near Mbutudi, Barth saw the first deleb=palm and tasted its fruit, which was just about to ripen. Similar to the dum=palm, this plant is of great importance to the natives and provides them with a popular seasoning for their simple dishes. The uneven, mountainous terrain continued for some time. In some places, agriculture was very poor due to warlike unrest. If, however, the country was in dearth, then only man, not nature, was to blame for the shortage; for in these regions, as Barth rightly remarked, "nature has done everything for man: bowls, spoons and bottles grow on the trees; rice grows in the forest; grain and almonds thrive without effort; the soil, in addition to the cane of the forest and field, provides the necessary material for the dwelling, and only some clothing and pearl jewelry - whoever makes these demands on life - still has to be bought. Where life is made so easy and the acquisition of food so comfortable, it should not come as a surprise that the rich generally do little more than what is urgently necessary. Exceptions to this rule are all the more gratifying. In the course of the expedition we learn of dyeing plants and indigo cultures, of blacksmiths, weavers, industrious cattle breeders and industrious farmers. The traveler was also presented with several fine examples of house-building techniques, perhaps most notably in Ssarau, whose huts deserve special attention. Barth was shown into a dwelling which actually consisted of "a group of three huts, with mud walls and an excellently woven cane roof", and which was surrounded by a common mud wall, so that the whole formed a rounded triangle. The largest of the three huts, about 12 feet in diameter, formed the entrance hall or vestibule and was provided with two doors, one leading to the outside and the other to the inner courtyard. Inside the hut was an extensive resting place 7 feet long and 5 feet wide, made of a framework of strong branches thickly covered with clay. The walls were painted light brown and had a number of crude paintings, although their meaning was unclear in most cases. A few wooden writing boards, as used by the schoolboys there, stood out all the more clearly. This is because the Fuldians set up schools in at least the main centers of their empire, where reading, writing, arithmetic and Arabic were taught. The fact that a bookseller traveled to Jola with Barth's caravan speaks for the spread of intellectual culture. Even in Udsche, ordinary paper was one of the best-known "tre lune" market articles. Our explorer was able to give the governor of Mubi an extraordinary treat by providing him with 10 sheets of writing paper. The people who could read were most astonished at the "so incredibly small print" in Barth's English poetry book. But now back to the houses of Ssarau! The two other, somewhat smaller huts had no outside doors; they were only accessible from the inner courtyard and were really considered family rooms. This is where the woman's sturdy clay storage room was located, which was protected from prying eyes by a transverse wall. The stock of pots and cooking utensils was displayed here on a clay stove - like a kitchen board. Although, according to local custom, there were no windows and the light could only enter through the door, the walls were still painted in pretty colors, so that the entire interior of the little houses betrayed the people's highly developed sense of comfortable living. As far as Barth could inspect the terrain from his camp in Ssarau, the village seemed to lie almost in the center of a spacious ring of hills, whose picturesque crests and peaks rose quite stately, especially in the east, south and west. The descent to the Benus Valley only began some distance beyond the village, which is why the western trade route still converges here on the heights with the main route from Kuka to Jola. Cloves were a much sought-after product at that time; women were mainly in demand for the aromatic fruit. Scissors, medicines and paper were also in high demand. Soap was prepared according to an indigenous recipe in every household and was an important consumer item in all areas inhabited by the Fulbe. Salt was brought into the country from outside. On June 15, the descent into the valley began. A beautiful grassy plain with large complexes of cultivated land stretched out before the travelers. Occasionally, small stands of forest intervened; then a village or a slave hamlet came into view, adding to the charm of the landscape. The waters flowed directly southwards through the Majo or Mao Tiel towards the great river, which was becoming increasingly clear. At a small lake, Barth discovered the first traces of hippopotamus; buffalo were cavorting in the grass, and at Ssulleri there were huge ant hills, which, as Barth notes, are always found in the vicinity of rivers. - Another short march and the caravan stopped on the banks of the Benus, just opposite the headland of Taepe, behind which the Faro River breaks out and reinforces the main artery. The blue river flowed majestically from east to west; a "great path lay open here, a gateway for the vigorous, overwhelming forces of the north." Only low on the horizon did mountains restrict the panoramic view. In the far south, like a cloud, stood the long-sought Alantika, although Barth had overestimated its height by a factor of two. We now know that the elevations near Jola are only 600 to 900 meters high and a little further west up to 1000 meters. Mount Karin, with which the highlands fall back sharply against the Faro valley, measures 1200 meters; then follow several cones that are almost half as high, until finally Alantika, Mogidi, Sulabe and others make up the culmination points of the whole system at 1500 meters. Barth believed 40 years ago that Alantika had an absolute elevation of 9000 feet. Barth's hope of seeing European ships navigating the magnificent Benus waterway was to be fulfilled sooner than he himself believed. His report, which he sent to the British government after his return from Kuka, attracted the most general attention in Europe. Lord Palmerston praised Barth with the utmost confidence; in Germany, Karl Ritter, Petermann and von Bunsen emphatically pointed out the value of the new discovery, through which the work of the Lander brothers, who had previously lifted the veil from the mouth of the River Riger, was first elevated to its true significance. As early as 1854, an expedition under W. Balsour Baikie with the steamer "Plejade" went up through the Riger into the Benus and sailed the latter at 11½ degrees east longitude from Grw. where they remained no more than one degree away from the entrance of the Faro. The tracks of the German explorer were quickly followed in the Sudan by several inquisitive compatriots, such as Vogel and Rohlfs, who crossed the Benus on various occasions and were able to determine longer stretches of its course, until in the most recent period of research the meritorious Flegel traversed the entire course of the river from its source to its mouth on often repeated trips. He was able to solve the riddle of the Benus completely, admittedly with a somewhat different result than originally expected; for according to the volume of the river at the Taepe, where Barth saw it, one could safely conclude that it had a longer upper course. However, if Barth had written Flegel "had gone beyond Taepe to the east, perhaps as far as the mouth of the Mao Kebbi, he would have realized that, apart from the important Faro, it is essentially the Mao Kebbi that gives the Benus its reputation at Taepe and Jola. Above the Kebbi, the river turns from a navigable stream into a mountain roof, from which one immediately realizes that its source is not far away. Roch the day of the discovery, Dr. Barth made the passage via Benus and Faro, crossed the low, swampy inundation plain and then ascended to the foothills of the southern mountains. The direction of travel now became purely easterly towards Jola and led through well-cultivated lines where "cattle,

Page 276

 Horses, donkeys, goats and sheep enlivened the green carpet in a variety of colors and shapes." There were plenty of large baobab trees, especially in the area around the village of Ribäo or Ribago, our mountain Bagele, which juts out towards the river. So June 20th arrived, the day on which Barth saw himself at the destination of his wishes, in the capital Jola. At that time, the town was still a good distance south of Benus and should not be confused with the Jola of today, which is located much closer to the water off the mouth of the Mao Beti, opposite the island of Donga. According to Barth's estimates, the old Jola had around 12,000 inhabitants, a mosque, a spacious marketplace and a fort-like mud building in which the lamido or governor Mohammed Loél, the son of Mallem Adama, resided. Barth was only able to gain access to the ruler after a long wait. However, the latter did not seem to be unhappy to see our explorer at the audience when suddenly Barth's Bornuan companion, the officer Billama, emerged with three letters in which the ruler of Kuka asserted his claims to the previously mentioned border area of Kofa and Kobchi. No sooner had the letters been read out than a veritable storm of indignation arose against the Vornuans; Mohammed Loël threatened war and, in his excitement, made furious accusations even against Barth. Nobody wanted to hear of a peaceful mission by the white man; the prince believed him to be a scout and ordered him to leave the country as quickly as possible. All of Barth's counter-arguments, however skillfully and using all the tricks of African diplomacy, were to no avail. The "Sultan", as all the governors in the provinces of the Sokoto Empire call themselves, stuck to his word, and Barth had to turn back - in view of the tempting proximity of the ocean, which he intended to reach from here. His decision was made all the more difficult by the fact that he had met an Arab in Jola who had traveled for many years along the East African coast between Mombas and Sofála and could describe "the famous Lake Nyassa" as an eyewitness. It was here, at the southernmost point of his journey, that Barth received "the first clear view of those extremely interesting regions" that had formed "the fantastic background" of his plans when he set out on the expedition - and it was here that he was forced to turn back. Many of these reports are now only of historical value. They tell us about the founding of the Islamite kingdom of Adamana, whose real old name is Fumbina, by the enterprising Fulbe= prince Mallem Adama, who overpowered the small pagan neighboring kings at the time of Sultan Bello. According to popular legend, the wife of the happy conqueror was also called Adama, so that Adamana would mean something like "the two Adama". In any case, this title introduced by the Fulbe does not include all parts of the former Fumbina, but only refers to those areas that were actually subjugated and colonized. Jola is also a completely new creation: the "former capital, of which Denham had already heard, was Gurin." Barth now describes Jola 40 years ago with its extensive farmsteads, which at the same time surround the cornfields; he mentions blacksmithing as the only local trade; he lists the market articles, among which even then English cotton products played a prominent role; he gives us a deep insight into the atrocities of slavery, which existed in Adamaua to an extent not seen anywhere else in Central Africa Furthermore, a good part of Barth's digressions on the orohydrography of Adamaua belong to the field of historical geography; above all, the river network has taken on a different form than our researcher thought he had foreseen. The fact that Dr. R. Kiepert, despite the rich cartographic material of modern times and the large three-sheet map of Ed. W. Flegel's travels for Jola, has "almost reinstated his old Barthian position" speaks best for the accuracy of his itinerary surveys and local determinations. 1) Finally, Barth's information on the climate, soil conditions and natural products of Adamaua, which we get to know as a healthy country that is not perishable for the existence of Europeans, cannot be overestimated. The list of useful plants together with information on their location etc. fills almost two pages of the large travel book; the notes on the animal world are shorter, among which the occurrence of a species of manatee related to the Manatus Senegalensis in Benus, confirmed by Dr. Vogel, is undoubtedly of most interest to us. The horse, which *) S. the Mitteilungen der Afrikanischen Gesellschaft in Deutschland, vol. 5 p. 162.
most probably only introduced in recent times, no longer seems to like the southern regions; it remains small and weak, although it has probably not yet suffered from the well-known "African disease". "The best horses are brought from the northern districts, especially from Uba. Moving on to the population of the country, Barth describes the tribes he visited in turn, first and foremost the Fulbe, to whom he has to give an excellent report overall. He praises their simplicity of customs, their patriarchal family life and their abstinence from tobacco and alcoholic beverages, while the indigenous, half-naked heathens indulge passionately in the latter pleasures. In short, there is hardly a point that the attentive researcher would have overlooked. And his reports are all the more valuable and deserve everyone's attention because they are given completely objectively, quite sine ira et studio, by a serious scientist, and at a time when even the boldest dreamer in Germany would hardly have thought of acquiring his own colonies. The learned explorer of the Sudan did not even travel on behalf of a German government; he was in the pay of England, and the latter did not hesitate to draw immediate practical benefits from the work of the foreigner. Petty enthusiasm and philistine grumbling are quite alien to the British when it comes to the advancement of domestic interests; he prefers a deliberate, energetic approach that does not allow itself to be deterred by initial failures. By contrast, what dismal experiences Flegel had with his fellow countrymen! How pitiful a comparison between England and Germany would be for us! According to the "Sultan's" instructions, Barth set off on his return journey on June 24. In general, he kept to the same route he had chosen on the outward journey; only from Udsche=Kassukula did he take the direct road to the capital Bornus instead of the route that had previously curved somewhat to the east. During the march, Barth was shaken by fever several times. The nasty guest had been with the traveler since the day he entered Jola. As long as the destination still lay ahead of him, the mental stimulation kept him fresh; but the moment this excitement subsided, the fever promptly returned - a phenomenon that recurs only too often in the life of an African explorer. On the very same day, at the very same hour, that Barth entered Timbuktu, the "object of his most ardent and anxious endeavors for a whole year", he fell ill. In the last week of his journey, the rainy season began in Vornu and caused Barth many new ailments and worries. On July 24, he was back in his "African homeland", in the monotonous Kuka. He found his friends there, the sheikh and his vezier and above all Dr. Overweg, in good health and was able to prepare himself, as far as his fragile health allowed, for the next ventures, which were aimed at the still unexplored countries around Lake Chad. We thus bid farewell to the rare man to whom science owes so much and who, through his journey to Jola and the discovery of Benus and Faro, made a fully important contribution to the knowledge of our West African colonial possessions. H. Seidel. The Wanjamuest. By Paul Reichard. (Conclusion.) Trade and commerce. Once the Mjamuesi are back in their homeland, they immediately start farming or individual master craftsmen practise their trade. There can be no question of actual craftsmen, as the skills acquired are not regarded as a means of earning a living, but only occasionally, as circumstances permit or as the desire to do so changes, the skill acquired is applied. Above all, there are the blacksmiths, who usually also understand the preparation of iron, which is obtained by repeated melting and remelting of the iron ore, lawn ironstone, in Unjamuest as wrought iron. The blacksmiths are very skilled and make hoes, hatchets, spears, arrow and knife blades, as well as iron jewelry. Wire drawing is also well known to the Wanjamuesi Others weave coarse cotton fabrics. Bark trunks are made by beating tree trunks. Others carve low stools, plates and boards for serving food or large wooden mortars for pounding flour, rush mats are woven; only the women know how to make pottery. Lindo, the

Page 277

are round boxes made of tree bast, are in great demand and always sell well, in all sizes; those of finger-length diameter to store fat, jewelry, medicine in; larger ones for fabrics and very large, barrel-like ones used as storage containers for crops The Wanjamuesi's preference for trade, which they love passionately and also have a pronounced sense for, is particularly noticeable in the sale of these items. However, the nature of the trade can drive Europeans to despair. Everything is done with a tremendous amount of fuss and extreme mistrust and before a deal is finalized, it may have been reversed three or even four times. Anything that is not nailed down, such as land or forest and ore deposits, is negotiated. One's own person as a slave or as a wife as well as cattle, goats, sheep and poultry, ivory and food, iron hoes, weapons, fabrics and European barter goods from the coast, there is nothing that is not for sale. The Wanjamuesi have this sense of trade in common with all the Regers, but it is peculiar to them to a particularly high degree. The chief. The whole Mjamuesi country is divided into a number of larger and smaller states, the extent of which is generally independent of the tribal affiliation of the sub-tribes. Each such state community is headed by a chief, whom we can best describe as a democratic patriarchal antocrat. Women can also become chiefs among the Wanjamuesi. His power, which at first sight appears absolute, is in reality very limited. His actions are closely and anxiously controlled by his councillors and elders, without whose approval he can do nothing, especially when it comes to decisions of principle. Only in personal matters does he naturally have a freer hand than anyone else. His power is actually only based, as I have already explained elsewhere in the Deutsche Kolonial=Zeitung, on the witch trials, which give him considerable influence through the exercise of this atrocious form of administration of justice. Actually, the exercise of this administration of justice is without exception an abuse of his power, yet the chief always appears in the light of a ruler concerned for the common good, because the entire administration of justice in this regard is based on superstition. The chieftainship is hereditary, but not in the direct line; it always passes to siblings or their descendants if the parents did not rule themselves. There are exceptions, of course, where power issues are involved. Depending on his wealth and the size of his country, the chief naturally has a larger or smaller number of wives, called wagori, who, however, do not live in closed rooms but enjoy completely free movement like all the others. The army. The military force of the chiefs consists of the so-called ruga ruga, i.e. irregular warriors who enjoy a number of privileges. The subjects must provide them with maintenance everywhere free of charge, and as they take very great liberties, when a large body of such Ruga Ruga appears, the women are always brought to safety first. When war breaks out, all able-bodied men must serve in the army, unless a chief is particularly warlike and has a sufficiently strong army of Ruga Ruga because of continual fighting, so that he can dispense with the general army. Incidentally, there is a significant catch with this general succession. Most of them go out boasting, singing, dancing and feigning battle fury, but the closer they get to the enemy, the more of the fierce warriors either disappear completely or some of them only reappear when a village has been stormed and there is something to plunder. However, since this phenomenon occurs with both enemy parties, everything evens out again. The subjects. The population in the Unjamuesi state is divided into three classes, which cannot be described as "caste", namely the free subjects, the immigrant freemen and the slaves. As castes, however, there are also three classes: the nobles, the freemen and the slaves. The latter form the overwhelming majority of 70 to 75 percent in the land of Unjamnesi. Their position is more that of serfs, as is now generally known, and by no means oppressive. Rather, the free man is restricted in what he can and cannot do and is actually always subject to the suspicious control of the chief. He must constantly take care to gain the chief's satisfaction and always make sacrifices to do so; above all, he must not acquire too many possessions if he does not want to risk everything; he lives in constant worry and fear for his property and his life. The immigrant free man, however, leads the least enviable life of all. He is always a refugee who for one reason or another had to leave his actual homeland. He must expect to be expelled from his country at any moment. Freedom of movement does not exist in the whole of Africa. Administration of justice. With the exception of minor cases, the administration of justice lies entirely in the hands of the chief as the sole and final authority. According to these, justice is administered publicly with the participation of the advisory councils and elders. To the uninitiated, it appears as if the chief alone has the casting vote. In fact, this is not the case. Given the blacks' penchant for legal wrangling and hair-splitting, and the inadequacy of the language, negotiations are conducted with the greatest of awkwardness before a clear understanding of the situation can be reached. However, for countless reasons, weeks, months, even years can pass before a decision is reached, especially if gifts to the chief and his councillors do not speed things up. If, however, both parties to the dispute are in a position to influence the corrupt judges with gifts, it can happen that the proceedings drag on indefinitely The punishments never consist of custodial sentences, as there are no places for imprisonment, nor of corporal punishment. All punishments are either fines, i.e. compensation penalties, or capital punishment. In most cases, all disputes are settled by payment of compensation. Naturally, the chief receives the lion's share. The chief's advisors also claim payment for their efforts and then the injured party. There is no public accusation, and if, for example, someone slays a stranger, he must pay blood money to the chief. Not because of the murder as such, but because he has stained the ground with blood. The stranger is always without rights. Similarly, the master who kills his slave must pay blood money to the chief for the same reason, even though he has the right over the life and death of his slave. But since such a luxury is always very expensive, the master makes almost no use of his right. The murder of a fellow tribesman or compatriot is also almost always paid for by money to his relatives, even though the latter have the right to demand the murderer and kill him as well. The payments stipulated as punishments may consist of crops, chickens, goats, sheep, cattle, iron hoes, slaves and, here and there, ivory. The person concerned is ultimately liable for debts with his own person, parents can pledge their children and the latter their parents. Utani. A very peculiar custom, called "Utani", which is common to all East Coast peoples and is called by the same name everywhere, should be mentioned here. It is still widely practiced on the coast, while in the interior it is increasingly being forgotten. The word "Utani" cannot be translated. It is a peculiar legal relationship between certain tribes, such as the people from the Mrima with the Wanjamuesi or the individual coastal tribes among themselves. But they are always only very specific tribes, and it seems to be a certain condition that they may not border on each other, but I was unable to obtain any certainty about this, as the whole custom is very unclear and difficult to fathom. The Mtani, who must always be a free man or freeborn, may temporarily take the place of another, whose rights of possession of movable property he then fully assumes, if this other belongs to a tribe which is in an utani relationship with his own, but only for the duration of a short visit. He may take possession of his house, his entire property, even his wives, and the other must submit without resistance. He can take any object, even the most precious one, and keep it as his property. A Mtani can prevent a funeral, the appointment of a chief, a wedding or the start of a journey until a gift has been given to him. However, since the custom is based on reciprocity, there is hardly ever any abuse. If a poor Mtani gives too much to a rich one

Page 278

If a tribe has taken away a poor person's property and this rich person could not, in a given case, hold him harmless, the whole tribe or the whole village stands up for him in order to take away occasional utanigades from the poor person's tribe. In this way, for the sake of general control, abuse is prohibited by itself. In fact, tribes that are in an utani relationship with each other are not allowed to fight each other. In the past, this rule is said to have been strictly observed. Now it is only observed in individual cases when war is imminent. However, if someone opposes the claims of a Mtani, the village elder or any other judge called upon will always rule in favor of the one who has made the claim. Despite years of effort, I have not succeeded in researching the origin and significance of this highly peculiar custom. Tribes that are far apart from each other often have an utani relationship; they may have lived closer together in the past and have been separated by migrations. Since the mutual Utani relationship is nevertheless tenaciously maintained, even though the custom is increasingly being abandoned, the original meaning and purpose may have been an alliance. Religion. It is extremely difficult to find out anything about the religion of the Negroes, including the Wanjamuesi. According to my experience and observations, however, one would be mistaken if one were to believe that we are dealing here with a cult that has fallen into oblivion. Richts speaks in favor of such an assumption. On the contrary, I have the impression that we are dealing here with a rising race, only we must not assume their progress in the same proportion as ours. The Negroes do not seem to have had a so-called golden age. They are developing steadily, but tremendously slowly. The religious views of the Reger have something extraordinarily blurred about them. The main reason why it is so difficult to find out anything about them is that the people themselves know nothing precise about them. In general, the Wanjamuesi recognize a good principle "mlungu", an expression that could easily be translated as "God". But this mlungu is so good in and of himself that he can never do anything bad, never do anyone any harm. There is therefore no need to worry about him. It is a different matter with the masimu pl. missime. A mssimu is actually everything supernatural, invisible, with the exception of God. It is a collective term with such an elastic meaning that the word cannot be translated. Depending on the circumstances, it can mean: Demon, spell, guardian spirit, devil, fate and, in a certain sense, fetish, although fetish here should not be taken to mean the common term. The mssimu can be a stone, a tree, a pond, a lake, a rock, a forest, an animal or a person. However, the word is best interpreted as the forces of nature in connection with fate. However, since the forces of nature manifest themselves most obviously in their destructive effect, one tries to appease them through sacrifices, but these sacrifices may be so insignificant that they actually only represent a recognition of the forces of nature personified as evil powers. The Mssimu actually only inhabits the above-mentioned things, but is usually bound to a certain place, which in many cases differs nothing at all from its surroundings. Miniature huts are built for such mssimu, in which they then spend the night. There one lays down the hardly noteworthy offerings of flour, pombe, tobacco, heap, cloth, beads, bones, etc., but here and there even a small elephant's tooth on a miniature bedstead made of its sticks. A mssimu can be male or female. There are war=, road=, village=, country=, field= mssimu. Through the mediation of the wafumu, i.e. the medicine men or women, they also give answers to questions as to whether an undertaking will be successful or not and whether it would be good to start it or not, i.e. a kind of oracle. The medicine men, Wafumu, find it very easy to talk their way out of mistakes and false prophecies. The views on life after death are very peculiar. If you ask a Mjamuesi about this, he always answers that it is completely over after death, that there is no afterlife. On the other hand, they sacrifice to the manes, they say masimu wa daba, the mssimu of the father, or masimu wa majo, the mssimu of the mother, and these are sacrificed. But if you then draw their attention to the contradiction that exists with their view of not living on after death with this custom, they only reply that it ends with death. In the practice of their superstition, which can hardly be called a cult, childish acts are performed and childish means are used: Sticks, sticks, special instruments, in which neither the form nor the manner of use has any external or internal connection with the nature of the case at hand. The most foolish actions are carried out for specific purposes. Thus the Wanjamuesi=Wasumu throw the corpse of an executed sorceress into a puddle to bring rain for the rainy season. If someone has been struck by lightning, he must also be thrown into the water, otherwise others will also be struck dead. This is especially true when traveling. The large python is considered sacred by the Wanjamuesi and must never be killed. Even the extremely poisonous but very sluggish puff adder is not killed by the Wanjamuest, even if it crawls into a hut to hunt rats, which often happens! They are thrown at very carefully with straws to drive them away or they are left lying there. The Wanjamuesi also believe in a kind of werewolf, believing that sorcerers can turn into hyenas and eat corpses at night. The souls of sorcerers enter the bodies of leopards. Here we find the greatest contradiction with the belief in complete annihilation after death. In Unjamuesi there is a peculiar type of mushroom which grows in the form of a net-like plant the size of a fist in damp places here and there in the forest. The Wanjamuesi are also familiar with the so-called "duplicity of events", they say that all beings from man to the smallest beetle, from tree to blade of grass are created twice in exactly the same appearance. Conclusion. I have sketched a broad outline of the Wanjamuesi without going into detail about their character traits. Although the Wanjamuesi are in many respects superior to the other tribes, they are just as treacherous, thieving and deceitful as the others. Nevertheless, the Wanjamuesi are undoubtedly destined to play an outstanding role in East Africa. Their extraordinary intelligence, their well-developed sense of trade and their perceptiveness make them a valuable ally in our cultural endeavors in East Africa. The Wanjamuest have a great inclination towards nation-building, a sense of order and security and love to cultivate their fields in peace. Their ability to work is very important, as their vast fields show. Their perseverance as porters alone has made the wide expansion of the Zanzibar trade possible. Wherever the Wanjamuesi have gone into the interior, they have easily seized control, for example in Itaua and Kaubire, west of Tanganyika, in the headwaters of the Congo, in Katanga and in Westugogo. It must therefore be one of our main tasks to win over this intelligent tribe, whose residences are completely included in the German sphere of interest, and make them useful to us. It should not be too difficult a task. It requires a level-headed, experienced man, and we have such a man in Emin Pasha. However, it will not be possible without using force here and there, but as soon as we have reached the point where we have convinced the Wanjamuesi that we do not want to squeeze them dry, but rather create guarantees for them to be able to enjoy what they have acquired themselves, they will become our most important producers and consumers. News from the Society. The Society's committee held a meeting on October 21 under the chairmanship of Privy Councillor Simon, at which it first discussed the establishment of an appeal for money collections for the Wißmann steamers, as requested by the Cologne department. The speaker of the Commission for Practical Colonization, which was responsible for the preliminary examination, His Excellency Vice Admiral (ret.) Livonius, stated that the German Colonial Society was above all called upon to support Dr. Emin's undertakings, which were aimed at securing the property as well as the economic development of Inner Africa, to the best of its ability. It was of the greatest importance for German trade as well as for German industry to create a market for them in Inner Africa as soon as possible, and the efforts of Dr. Emin and von Wißmann deserved to be supported.

Page 279

The support of Dr. Emin was all the more sustained as both men were of the opinion that vigorous action in Inner Africa would have the intended success. In the subsequent debate, the Chairman stated, among other things, that the Central Office had been informed of Dr. Emin's intentions with regard to the stations to be established before him and that, in connection with this, the energetic actions of Reichskommissar v. Wißmann deserved only the highest praise. The Chairman also informed the meeting that various colonization projects were in progress, both in East and West Africa, and that the President was preparing a letter to the boards and departments concerning the entire programme of practical work for 1891, insofar as it could already be determined. The President has been informed of various needs on the part of Dr. Emin, the satisfaction of which appears necessary in the interest of the successful effectiveness of the stations in Inner Africa. As the Secretary General believes that some of the items required by the stations can be obtained as free contributions by individual departments from manufacturers, a sum is approved to cover the corresponding packing and transportation costs. The Secretary General is instructed to make the necessary arrangements and to reach an agreement with Mr. v. Wißmann and Mr. v. Gravenreuth regarding the land transport of the goods to the interior. A resolution is passed to draw up the budget for 1891 and the agenda is set for the board meeting to be held in November. The committee then takes note of the formation of the department in Hagen, initially with 58 members, and decides to co-opt the former director of the Witugesellschaft, Consul Schwabe, to the committee. - Koblenz Division. At a meeting of the department's board held on October 10, Bergrat Dr. Busse was elected chairman, District Administrator and Police Director Graf von Brühl deputy chairman, Mr. A. Trapet secretary and court bookseller Kind treasurer. - Gumbinnen department. On October 7, Pastor Petrenz=Judtschen spoke about missionary work in the colonies, mainly in a historical sense. We learn from the lecture that the first mission in Germany was founded by August Hermann Franke, namely the Danisch=hallische mission. Of the missionaries trained in Halle, two left for St. Thomas in 1732 with a travel allowance of 18 marks each and two left for Gronlank in 1733. The Herrenhut Brethren congregation, whose 150 emissaries worked in almost all parts of the world, numbered around 30,000 souls, but had done more for the missionary cause than the whole of Christendom in two centuries. The Basel Missionary School was opened in 1815. It works in West Africa, India and China. It also willingly took over the Cameroon mission. It has 130 missionaries in its 8 areas and an annual income of 682,000 marks. Soon after the founding of the Baiel Mission, the Berlin Mission was founded, which works in South Africa and more recently also in Ebina; it has 58 missionaries and an annual income of 300,000 marks. The Rhenish Missionary Society was founded in 1825, whose purpose is the Cape Colony, Namaqua and Damaraland. It has 60 missionaries and an annual income of 300,000 marks. The North German Missionary Society is based in Bremen; it draws its missionaries from Basel, works in West Africa and New Zealand and has an annual income of 66,000 marks. Small announcements. [The Colonial Council.) After a supreme decree was issued on October 10 establishing a colonial council, the following decree was published by the Imperial Chancellor von Caprivi: "The members of the colonial council are appointed by the Imperial Chancellor. The colonial societies endowed with an imperial letter of protection or active in the Schupgebiete through the establishment of economic enterprises of significant size are requested to nominate members to the Colonial Council from their midst. Otherwise, the appointment from among the experts shall be at the discretion of the Imperial Chancellor. The members of the Colonial Council hold their office in an honorary capacity. The foreign members shall receive compensation for attending the meetings in accordance with their cash expenses in accordance with a special decree. The duration of these periods shall be one year. The Colonial Council shall meet at the request of the Imperial Chancellor under the chairmanship of the Head of the Colonial Department of the Foreign Office or the Deputy Head of the Colonial Department. It shall give its opinion on all matters referred to it by the Colonial Department and shall be authorized to pass resolutions on independent motions submitted by its members. The course of business is regulated by rules of procedure approved by the Reich Chancellor. Members of the Colonial Department and representatives of other authorities may attend the meetings in an advisory capacity with the approval of the Reich Chancellor. The Colonial Council elects a standing committee of three persons from among its members, which can be asked by the Colonial Department for its opinion on individual questions, either orally or in writing, outside the meetings of the General Assembly." - This fulfills a wish expressed by all sides, including by the German Colonial Society in a petition to the Reichstag. We must reserve further illumination of the Colonial Council until after the members have been appointed, as only then will it be possible to form a reasonably accurate picture of its presumed effectiveness. - (German=East Africa.) As is well known, the "Times" had spread lying news about the alleged slave trade in Bagamovo: the "Reichsanzeiger" now provides documentary evidence of the whole swindle, in which the English Consul General played a very ambiguous role. Danack traces the whole story back to an attempt by Soliman the Nasr to silence the complaints of his compatriots about the shortage of labor by drafting a proclamation according to which the Arabs were to be given permission to recapture and sell their slaves. The station chief of Bagamovo simply filed the draft away without going into the matter further. However, some of it must have reached Zanzibar, where the Arabs there, who were furious about the Sultan's slave decree of August 1st, even though it remained a dead letter, had made it known that they wanted to move to the coast to join the Germans. To prevent this and to induce the Germans to explain themselves, the English consul-general arranged the cunning Jntrigne, which collapsed so miserably. The author of the slanderous information has not yet been identified, as Evan Smith has given him special protection, which is hardly surprising, as the Times correspondent will certainly be in his wheelhouse. This Times correspondent is unlikely to be seen on the German coast, where the protection of the English Consul General is no longer available. - Major v. Wißmann intends to leave for Africa at the end of October. We have already referred to his later deployment. He has initiated the collections for the steamships in the right way and achieved great success, while Stanley complains in the Timedar that only 2,300 Lstl. have been collected for the English steamer on the Viktoria Nyanza. The English steamer is to be 45 feet long and 9 feet wide, while the Wissmann steamer will be considerably larger 88 feet long. 16 feet three and 8 feet draft. The engine will have a power of 220 horsepower. - The influential Arabs have returned to Kilwe. - At the beginning of October, the deputy Reichskommissar Dr. Schmidt wanted to undertake an expedition to the Roruma in order to visit the often-mentioned coal fields of the interior. - The hospital of the Protestant East African Missionary Society is likely to be relocated to Dar es Salaam after consultations have taken place in the Foreign Office. - (Size of the German=African colonies.) According to a new calculation by the Geographical Institute in Weimar, German=East Africa contains approx. 939,100 □hm. Southwest Africa approx. 832600 Ukm, Kamerun=Land approx. 319500 □km, Togo=Land approx. 61000 □hm, together in round sum a little over 2152000 Chw. According to the geographer Wauters, Togo contains 20000 Chm. Cameroon 500000 Ukm, Southwest=Africa 1000000 □km and East Africa 1200000 Ukw. Since an exact calculation is not yet possible, there is a choice. (The experimental introduction of silk culture in the German colonies of Africa is advocated by the German colonial newspaper. It is possible that the plan has prospects, although experience has shown that the culture of the silkworm requires quite intelligent, poorly paid and therefore regularly active workers, which is why almost every attempt to introduce this culture in the Negro states of the south of North America has so far failed (From the German East African Society.) The negotiations between the Foreign Office and the German East African Society on the reorganization in German East Africa are nearing their conclusion. The German=East African Society cedes to the Reich not only its sovereign rights but also its customs duties. From the proceeds of the customs duties, it receives from the empire a revenue from which it has to pay certain services to be imposed on it and also has to pay interest on and repay the 4 million marks which it has to pay to the Sultan of Sanstbar. (The downfall of the Küngel expedition and the events in Witn.) There are now detailed reports in the newspapers about the bloodbath in Witu, supplementing the earlier reports, from which it emerges that Küntzel's expedition was lured into a trap by the treacherous Suabelis, and that the first opinion spread by the English side, as if Küntzel and his comrades had forcibly entered the town after a dispute with the natives, is untenable. Küngel had set out for Fumo Bakari's residence with Häfeler and the Dolmeian in the first days of September and was received in a friendly manner, although the Sultan mentioned that he had lost confidence in Germany as a result of the German-German agreement. He had confidence in Küntzel, but demanded that he bring him a letter from the English confular agent Symons in Lamn that he was in agreement with the undertaking. Küngel sent Häßler to Lamu, but as Symons had traveled to Sanstdar, the matter was delayed. Küntzel returned to Mkonumbi, where the loads were unloaded. Everything was peaceful until September 9th, but then the continuation of the shed was put under suspicion, rumors spread that the Germans wanted to conquer the country, until Bana Omari, a respected advisor and friend of Künzel, arrived on September 11th and declared that the Sultan had no objections to the company, but wished to see the letter from the English consular agent. Künnel decided to obtain this letter himself. In the meantime, a favorable place had been found to build the sawmill in Utuani (see map in No. 44, 1868), but already on the 14th a messenger came to Küntzel from Mkonumdi, who delivered Waifen and the warning to be on his guard, as a letter brought to him by Bana Omari meant nothing good. On the 15th, soldiers and officials of the Sultan appeared with a letter from the Sultan forbidding the further occupation of the hut, and the Germans,

Page 280

 which had already been abandoned by their porters, were ordered to come to Witn. They found themselves surrounded by many armed men, who packed up their belongings and escorted the Germans to Witu, where they were given a dilapidated hut near the Sultan's residence. An hour after their arrival, the Germans were told to come to the Sultan and asked to leave their weapons with their luggage under the supervision of one of their men. At the sultan's house, a tall, broad-shouldered man was introduced to them as the sultan, who, as we later learned, was not the sultan but his uncle Baua Mku. As there was no interpreter, the Germans were told that they were dismissed; they went back to their house to find all their weapons gone and their luggage ransacked. At about 5 o'clock Künzel arrived accompanied by Bana Omari, who was friendly to the Germans, but Küntzel was unable to obtain an audience with the Sultan. On the 15th the armed men became more numerous and bolder, so that Künzel advised them to try to escape through one of the city gates, especially as a number of soldiers had left the gate facing Mkonumbi. Some old, unserviceable flintlock rifles had been found in the hut, but they were taken along for the sake of appearances, Künzel took his carbine, Stauf the rifle, Meuschel and Trottlef a revolver each, the others namely Urban, Jaschvetzko, Claus and Karl Horn the three flintlock rifles and some axes. The band left the house at about 10 o'clock and arrived happily at the southern gate, which was opened by the called guards. The band quickly ran towards it and tried to remove the still obstructing crosspieces, when shots rang out and the bullets hit the gate and the picket. Urban was immediately shot in the head and Karl Horn was no longer seen. They followed the road to Kiloni at a run, keeping the pursuers at bay, until attackers approached from the side and the Germans were killed, with the exception of Meuschel, who, wounded in the thigh, hid in the high grass as he could not march any further. Küntzel put up a manly fight until he had exhausted his ammunition and succumbed to the superior forces. Fritz Horn was murdered near Mkonumbi on September 16. That the Sultan of Witu's action was not merely directed against Küntzel's invasion can be seen from further events. The day after the murder in Witn, the buildings on a shamba of Benndorf and a smaller property of the Denbardt brothers in Witu were also burnt down. On the night of September 17-18, the Baltia plantation, on which a German named Beduke was located, was attacked by Sultan troops. (The co-owner Friedrich was not present) Bedule tried to escape to Hiddi=udogo, shot down 20 soldiers on the way back, but was mortally wounded by 2 shots and collapsed in front of Hiddiudogo. On September 18, the Germans Schönert and Toost came from their plantation Wanga, in the north of Manda Bay, to Lamu with the report that they had been attacked by the Sultan's troops, warned by the village elder in Wangi, they had left their plantation at night, which was also burned down shortly afterwards. On September 27 (letter dated October 2) the missionaries arrived in Lamu from Ngao am Tana via Kau and Kipini, two Germans and the Swede Hederström. They had hardly embarked in Kipini when Fumo Bakari's soldiers appeared with the order to capture or kill them. The Sultan sent a message to Haeßler, who had stayed behind in Lamn, that he could receive the belongings of the expedition in Mionumbi in addition to the rifles. He was probably trying to use this ruse to get Haeßler or other Germans to act as guarantors. The "Times" reports from Zanzibar on the 23rd of Mis: According to news received from Momdasa, the Sultan is said to refuse to obey the English authorities and to give satisfaction for the murder of Kunzel and his comrades. It is said that he is preparing for hostilities; numerous reinforcements are being rushed here from the neighboring tribes. English warships have already sailed to Lamu. The German consul in Zanzibar has also traveled there to witness the investigation of the case by the English authorities and the execution of the sentence. Würzburg). Professor v. Stengel, who several years ago was the first university lecturer in Breslau to make the legal relations of the German Schupgebiete the subject of academic lectures, will give a one-hour lecture on German colonial law at the local university this winter semester. In view of the great interest that the development of our colonies is currently attracting in legal terms in wide circles, it is to be expected that this lecture will also be well attended by non-students. - (The first two East African medals have appeared. One with the portrait of Major von Wißmann in uniform with cork helmet, well captured in high relief, the other with the portrait of Dr. Carl Peters in the costume of an African traveler, modelled from life by the sculptor Türr. Both bear an allegory on the reverse: Germania carrying the imperial flag across the sea to the far south with the inscription: "Ostafrika 1889-99". The medals were struck in the size of a five mark piece in silver and bronze at the Berlin medal mint Otto Oertel, Gollnowstraße 11a. - (The German Colonial Calendar for 1891) will be published in mid-November.

Eugelmann, Director of the Kaufmännische Hochschule in Cologne. This first edition of this new work, published by Palm u. Enke. Erlangen, by the well-known author, contains in the prospectus
The author's intention is to provide traders and business people with the opportunity to obtain advice easily and quickly on legal questions that arise, and to produce a work that explains the correct meaning of the legal terms used in trade and commerce, the generally applicable legal rules and principles, and the provisions of our codes in a generally understandable and exhaustive manner. As far as can be judged from the first delivery, this goal will be fully achieved. In clear language, avoiding all superfluous foreign words, in which unfortunately our commercial language is so rich, all common expressions are explained conceptually and the legal propositions concerning them are treated, whereby the author understands it excellently to always strictly maintain the boundary between superficial brevity and too deep penetration, as would only be appropriate for a legal reference work; everywhere the necessary is generally understandable. The longer treatises, such as "Stock Corporations", "Labor Protection Legislation", "Railway Freight Law" and the like are particularly appealing. There are only a few minor points to criticize, e.g. at the end of the paragraph on "absolute commercial history", it must be noted that "mutual insurance policies are not absolute commercial transactions". Under "Conclusion of commercial transactions" we miss the question of the nature of the conclusion of contracts by telegraph and telephone, which is so important today If under "Antiquarian" it is taught that the antiquarian is only a junk dealer, not a merchant, this is not correct. According to Art. 10 of the Commercial Code, only the provisions on companies apply to so-called small traders. In all other respects they are deemed to be merchants, especially with regard to the informality of contracts, etc. However, such infringements, of which we have yet to find any, are not capable of impairing the value of the work as a whole. We believe that it will be a very welcome reference book for traders and business people and will be indispensable for beginners who are still learning and who want to inform themselves about relevant legal issues. We doubt, however, that this work will enable the merchant to obtain immediate advice on every legal question that arises and to make a correct judgment on the extent of the rights and obligations involved in all legal transactions, as the author claims in the preface.

Stanley-Varttelot, Emin Pasha-Jephson. Stanley and his wife have left for America on a lecture tour and his English friends, who would like to know more about the relationship between him and Barttelott, are very angry because they see a storm of indignation gathering in the audience against their hero, which is all the more dangerous because it is fomented by Englishmen. When the Germans alone were heated against Stanley, the matter was of little concern, but now that some of the Englishmen on the expedition, who are highly embittered by Stanley's appearance, are preparing to reveal the secret of the motives for "rescuing" Emin Pasha, they would like Stanley to show less desire to travel. The reason for these attacks lies in the contemptuous manner in which Stanley spoke of Major Barttelot, the leader of the Nachhul, and his companions. One remembers that Barttelot had settled in Pambuja to wait there for the porters to be provided by Tippu Tipp and then to follow the advancing Stanley. The promised porters, however, were not delivered by Tippu Tipp, although the major made every effort to get them; instead of them, the grizzled Arab sent several hundred of the wild Manhemas, with whom Barttelot finally advanced. He did not get far, however, as he was soon killed, and the rearguard returned to the camp, where, deprived of their leader, they waited idly until Stanley returned and fetched them up to Lake Albert. In his book Stanley now reproached both Major Barttelot and the other Englishmen of the rearguard most bitterly for not having followed him, and described the former in particular as a man who had not acted in accordance with his duty. The deceased's brother objected to this insinuation and proved from his diary that there had been a strained relationship between him and Stanley from the beginning. Stanley had even made threatening remarks, e.g. that he could destroy the major's military reputation, as he generally liked to indulge in threats. Stanley naturally tries to defend himself, but one does not get the impression that he is being honest. Stanley made all sorts of accusations to an interviewer from the Herald, who informed him of the matter, but without backing them up with evidence. He would not retract a word about Barttelot, but even insinuated that the truth was much worse. Things in the Pambuja camp were shrouded in a mysterious darkness, which he had not yet cleared up out of respect for the living. He had only printed the reports of Mr. Bonny and Mr. Ward in mutilated form so as not to disgrace a brave but otherwise ill-advised officer. From these hints it appears with some certainty that Stanley believes in the existence of a conspiracy which was directed against him and had the ultimate purpose of killing him in the wilderness. But Stanley moves only in dark hints, and we must wait until the undiluted reports appear before a definite judgment can be made on the attitude of the rearguard. Stanley voiced other suspicions against Barttelot, claiming that he was not murdered but killed. This is a distinction of his, but Stanley's view is fiercely contradicted. Again, Stanley wants to have changed something in Bonny's report so that the meaning is obscured. According to Stanley, Barttelot then approached Sanga's wife in a way that made it necessary for her husband to intervene, whereas now Bonny, Barttelot's successor, firmly denies that the man's offended honor had anything to do with the murder of the major. This way of fighting will have to be described as utterly ignoble by all fair-minded people. On the one hand we have only the diaries of a deceased man, who was at any rate a violent and irascible man, but otherwise a gentleman; on the other hand, Stanley, the living man, is ready to come out with new insinuations which are difficult to refute. The brother of the deceased Jameson thus finds himself in the awkward position of waiting to publish anything about his brother, knowing that Stanley will await the publication of all his works before proceeding anew. If Barttelot or Jameson were still alive, Stanley would have been brought before a court long ago to prove his allegations, but now only public opinion can force him to do so. The question at the moment is this: will he, the living, formulate the charges against the dead accurately before the last word is said in their favor, or will he let the present opportunity to clear himself of the accusations against him pass in order to secure a better tactical position from which he can later make new accusations against the dead that can no longer be answered? But while Bonny and Ward have not yet become talkative, Rose Troup, who is currently in New Hork, does not mince his words. He admits that Barttelot has done many things that can be put down to his excessive nervousness, that he did not understand how to deal with the natives, but that Stanley is to blame for having put this man at the head of the rearguard. As far as the treatment of the natives was concerned, however, nothing had happened that Stanley would not have done in the same situation. In particular, he supports the view that Barttelot was murdered when he tried to prevent the forbidden drumming of the porters during the night. Furthermore, he proves that Stanley had left only the unfit and sick for the rearguard, so that it was impossible to proceed without the promised porters. "Stanley left Pambuja," Troup said, "on June 28, 1887, intending to be back by November 1887 at the latest. According to him, his destination was 360 miles in a straight line. His long and disastrous march through unknown country now belongs to history. Had he waited, he would have been given hints as to how he could have made the same march comfortably and without danger by a better route, and all the misfortunes that accompanied his progress could have been avoided. I say this because I believe that Stanley was not driven forward solely from philanthropic considerations when he left us helpless,

Page 282

 when he plunged into an undiscovered country. What he sought was wealth and fame. He left us in camp with the promise of reinforcements from Tippu=Tipp, which me came. Month after month passed without help. Our people lay dead left and right. Some deserted, more than 100 died of disease and the rest were so weak that they could hardly drag themselves, let alone carry loads. Finally 400 Manyema porters arrived, but they were lazy and insolent and soon realized that they had us in their power. And they acted accordingly." It is irrefutably clear from this, as could already be read between the lines in Stanley's travel book, that Stanley cared little for humanitarian motives, that he was completely indifferent to Emin Pasha, and that he was only thinking of hauling away the ivory he had collected. This was the purpose of the carriers! Today it has finally been recognized everywhere that Stanley's Emin Pasha move was nothing more than a failed trade speculation. It is obviously quite impossible for Stanley to look at any man objectively; he only appreciates him from the point of view of his relationship to him, and this explains the skewed and hostile portrayal of Emin Pasha that we all know. Mounteney Jephson's work was therefore eagerly awaited, as he had the most detailed knowledge of the events in the Aquator Province and Stanley referred to him several times as an "Eminist" in his work "In Darkest Africa". The book has also recently been published,*) but if one had hoped to find some more information about the decisive events in Kavalli, one has been disappointed. First of all, let us note what is of interest right now, that Jephson praises Major Barttelot, which is favorable to him from the beginning, when he writes: "I have not doubted for a moment that Barttelot did his duty bravely and honorably; but perhaps he lacked prudence and was hasty. The story of this terrible time will, I fear, never be known exactly; but whatever may have happened, anyone who really knew him will instinctively recognize that he was an honourable, upright man and sought to do his duty". But his judgment is not always so uninfluenced by Stanley as in this case, for Stanley collaborated on the work, ostensibly only to secure it from reprinting in the United States, but probably to protect his friend Jephson, He succeeded very well, so that Jephson was not even astonished when Emin Pasha showed him his ivory treasures, with which the expedition could have made a good deal, but that everything in the book oozes humanity and philanthropy. But to return to the course of history, Jephson recounts how he visited the stations with Emin Pasha, while Stanley, as is well known, traveled back to bring up the rear. The letters of the Khediv and Nubar Pasha were read out and the consequences soon became apparent. For once no one believed the English, against whom some of the officers under Arabi Pasha had fought, but then it was a great mistake that it was left to the discretion of the people whether they wanted to stay or not, and that no help was brought. This made them insecure, and since, according to Jephson's testimony, the Egyptians and Sudanese there were the most depraved rabble in the world, the spirit of rebellion could spread, which led to the capture of the two in Dufilé. The invasion of the Mahdists brought their liberation; they returned to Lake Albert, it seemed impossible to hold out against the rebels and Mahdists, so that Emin Pasha finally, but still hesitating at the last moment, went to Stanley. We will not go into the individual events during this time in detail; they are told with sufficient breadth and vividness, and Jephson has preserved his judgment here with sufficient clarity. He praises Emin's selflessness and justice, his loyalty to his villainous surroundings, but he also makes the mistake again of thinking, like Stanley, that Emin Pasha should have immediately torn himself away from a region and a population in which he was interested from several points of view. The stubbornness with which Emin Pasha wanted to hold out until the last moment is interpreted as weakness; the desire of the few Englishmen to get away as soon as possible from a country where the ground was burning under their feet should have been decisive for him. Jephson now *) Emin Pasha and the mutiny in Aquatoria. Nine months' stay and captivity in the last of the Sudanese provinces. By A. J. Mounteney Jephson and Heury M. Stauley. Authorized German edition. With 46 illustrations, a facsimile table and a map. Leipzig, F. A. Brockhaus 1890.
has added a conclusion to his work, which was supposedly written before the end of March 1890, in which he destroys the good impression he makes on the reader by recognizing Emin Pasha's activities and merits. Jephson is obviously annoyed that his lord and master Stanley is no longer willing to believe that Emin Pasha has entered German service instead of fulfilling his "duty of gratitude" and going on a tour of Europe with his "rescuers", as is now more or less customary for travelers to Africa. He thus accuses the Pasha of having been very unamiable on the march, of having cared for nothing but scientific matters (which, as is well known, Stanley had tried to ridicule in the most clumsy manner), of not having been able to please anyone, of not even having taken the opportunity to show himself to be a master of entertainment. What pitiful exhibitions on a man who had just seen his life's work collapse behind him and was forced to go along with people whose motives he probably saw through! Truly, if Emin Pasha had easily ignored everything that had happened, as the English, who were happy about his return, wished, we would be missing a trait in his character that makes him all the more valuable to us. According to Jephson's views in the conclusion, written after Emin's statement against the English, Emin is of a friendly, noble character, physically courageous but morally weak, a consummate gentleman who loves the natural sciences enthustastically but does not possess the firmness needed to lead people or the disposition to attract and dominate them. Emin's natural goodness of heart was constantly clouded by his nervous irritability, and his sincere European straightforwardness and accuracy had been shaken by too long a stay among Orientals. Who can say what is exaggeration and what is truth? Jephson is obviously sincere in what he says, but he is only telling half the truth. And therein lies the flaw in this book, which makes us wish in the liveliest way that Emin Pasha himself would provide a history of the events of that eventful time. It is not meant to be a defense, for he does not need one, but a description of the country and its people, the development of the circumstances with all their ramifications, which Jephson could not fully appreciate due to his short stay, and the internal events, so that finally a longed-for conclusion to these unpleasant stories can be found for all those who are interested in them. Description of the coast between Mossamedes and Port Nolloth.") The description of the coast of our southwest African colony must include Mossamedes in the north and Port Nolloth in the south, as the road from Mossamedes currently leads into the interior of the northern Owambo country and the road from Port Nolloth leads into the interior to the country of the Bondelswaarts. At present we can only reach the banks of the Cunene from Portuguese territory, and the banks of the Orange River can hardly be reached in any other way than through English territory. In the latter respect, however, it will have to be our task to establish a connection from Angra Pequena to the land of the Bondelswaarts. Mossamedes Bay,2) which takes its name from the Portuguese governor of Angola who discovered it in 1715, is also called Little Fish Bay according to English maps. The bay, which is about 6 nautical miles deep, is bordered to the north by Cape Euspa and to the south by Annunciaçao Point. In the bay, about 7 kilometers south of Cape Euspa, a rocky promontory, Ponta do Giraul (or Resdonda), rises from the otherwise flat coast, with a moderate elevation, the dark tip of which serves as a navigational marker for ships entering the harbor from the south. The coastal edge between Cape Euspa and Ponta do Giraul is covered with wild fig trees, from Ponta do Giraul it soon becomes sandy, and only on the south side does the Regrospitze and to the west of it the Noronha peak, 125 English feet high, protrude. The Portuguese fort, whose garrison consists of the other half of the battalion lying in Benguela, is located on the Negro Point, and a The present work is mainly based on the information in Findlay's South Atlantie, in the Africa Pilot and in the Annalen der Hydrographie. See also Charles John Andersson, A journoy te Lake Ngami, London 1857; by the same author The Okavango River, London 1861, and Thomas Baines, Explorations in South West Africa, London 1864. *) The older official name of the bai was "Angra do Negro".

Church with two towers. A beacon burns on the tip of Noronha; the deste anchorage is between Negro and Noronha. From Noronha, the coastal edge of the bay continues as a cliff, about 2 kilometers to the tip of Wrangler, where the shore becomes low and sandy again, to the tip of Annunciacao. The distance from Noronha to Annunciaçao is about 11 kilometers. The Bero River (also called Cubal) flows into the depths of the bay and its southern bank is bordered by pleasant gardens. The river dries up in the summer and drinking water must then be obtained by digging in the sandy riverbed. The village of Mossamedes, which had 300 white inhabitants in 1881, has since gained in importance, especially due to the influx of Portuguese farmers. Von Danckelmann, who visited Mossamedes in 1883, estimated the white population of the village at 8000 souls. It is the friendliest Portuguese harbor and offers many advantages for a longer stay due to its healthy climate and its abundant supply of fine cattle and vegetables. The rather extensive native village lies on the bay close to the anchorage, and isolated huts are scattered around the entire bay." The hilly coast stretches from Annunciaçao to the high reefs of Kay Negro (15° 40 45" S. B.), about 54 kilometers away. The open bay formed by the cape is full of reefs. The cape takes its name from the jet-black appearance of its rounded hill rising some 200 English feet, on the top of which stood until recent times the remains of a marble cross erected on this spot by the Portuguese Diego Cam? in 1486. From this point, which reminds us of the great period of Portuguese history, we head southwards to Alexander's Harbour, which is formed by a narrow sandy headland, the tip of which is at 15° 47° 30" s. Br. Br. and 11° 52' 45" east of G. On the landward side, the harbor is bordered to the east by 134 English-foot-high sandstone cliffs, which appear like an immense rampart. Ships find shelter in the harbour at any time of the year; the only danger is a sandbank in the harbour, which can be recognized by the color of the water. From Alexander Harbour the sandy coast turns WNW. about 5 kilometers, then WSW. about 5 kilometers, and continues to the south forming a bay whose southern end point is the Albinospitze, formed by light-colored rocks that from a distance look like a set of heaped-up marble column ruins. The dangerous coast is inaccessible due to the rough seas. The coastline from Mossamedes to Albino appears as a sandy yellow wall of low height, interspersed with gray horizontal stripes, while further inland a few mountain peaks can be seen above the coastline. From the Albinospitze you first reach the Great Fischbai. This, also known as Tiger Bay, is formed by the Tiger Peninsula off the coast, the tip of which, Tiger Peak, lies at 16° 30 s. Br. and 11° 46' 9" E. L.,3) 37 nautical miles from the tip of Albino. The bay itself has an extension from north to south of 18 nautical miles and a width between the coast and the peninsula of 5 nautical miles. The land around the large fishing bay consists of an endless series of sand hills without any vegetation. The peninsula, which rises only a few feet above the sea and is washed over in some places during heavy seas, as a result of which a lot of driftwood is found on it, does not have a width of more than 3 nautical miles at any point. According to the "Afrika Pilot" (Part II, 1884, p. 157), one can steer closely around the tip of the tiger and in the bay *) The Portuguese colonization of Mossamedes only began in 1839, the year in which the current governor of Angola sent an expedition overland from Benguela. Following this expedition, a settlement was established in Mossamedes. The Portuguese government endeavored to strengthen the settlement with whites, without being anxious about the choice of means. When in 1855 a Brazilian ship with German emigrants had to call at Lisbon as a result of an accident, these people were persuaded to let themselves be taken to Mossamedes, but the Portuguese colonial administration failed to take any care of them, so that the majority of them died in misery. Others still found the means to escape misfortune. (See von Danckelmann, Deutsche geographische Blätter vol. VII. issue 1 p. 31). According to Findlay, Bartholomeus Diaz erected the cross; the English captain Owen sanded it in 1825 at 15° 40 42" s. Br. and 11 58 18" east of G. Cape Regro can be described as the southernmost point of the Portuguese possessions; this is also the natural border with the German possessions to the south; the Cunene cannot be regarded as the natural border, nor as the functional border. *) According to Findlay, the Tiger Peak lies at 16° 30' 12* s. Br. and 11° 46° ö. v.
This information has been corrected by the commander of S. M. Kr. "Möwe", Corvette Captain Hoffmann (Ann. d. Hydr. 1885, p. 308) to the effect that 4, 5 to 6 nautical miles from Tiger Point the water depths suddenly decrease from 20 meters to 3 meters and then gradually flatten out even further towards the coast; Tiger Point is also said to extend about 3 nautical miles further to the east than indicated on the British chart. The same author reports elsewhere (Ann. d. Hydr. 1885, p. 135) that the cruiser "Möwe" also sounded decreasing depths at the southern end of the bay and anchored at a distance of about 2 cable lengths from the shallow beach, in 9 meters of water. There were some fishing establishments on the headland near the northern tip, which dried fish for shipment. They get their drinking water from the other side of the bay, where it is obtained by digging in the sand. Thousands of red flamingos populate the southern end of the bay. Leaving the bay and sailing south along the sandy coast covered with dark-colored dunes, we come to the mouth of the Cunene or Nourse River at a distance of 25 nautical miles from the southern end of the Great Fish Bay (17° 15° s. Br. Br. (which, as is well known, forms the border between the Portuguese and German possessions on this coast. The Cunene only reaches the sea in the first months of the year, while in the dry season a mighty sandbank blocks its outflow into the sea, which surges incessantly at this sandbank and particularly violently at the southern end, where a reef extends several nautical miles westwards.*) This latter statement by the "Afrika Pilot" has been corrected by H.M. cruiser "Möwe". The ship found the best landing place at the southern end, which could only be passed by surf boats. It arrived with a fresh southerly wind in front of the river, which was marked by a valley cut between the mountains. The water depth gradually decreased as we approached the coast; we anchored in 13 meters of water about ½ nautical mile off the bar. The estuary formed a 20-25 meter wide breach through the sandy beach, several meters deep and with such a strong current that the water had almost no brackish admixture until it reached the sea. Immediately behind the beach, the riverbed widened into a lagoon of apparently very variable size. The sand all around was so saturated with river water that it moved over long stretches like the thin blanket of a bog. About half an hour inland, the river was already running in a salty vett. The vegetation in this wasteland was sparse, but there were reeds and even a stunted acacia tree in the shelter of some sand dunes. Animals seen included antelopes, including 5 very large long-horned gemsbok antelopes, many water birds and a large crocodile. From the mouth of the Cunene southwards, along the coast of our colony, the landscape is nowhere better. Everywhere you look there are sand dunes, interrupted here and there by loosely piled heaps of sandstone; nor does any point on the coast offer Walvis Bay a harbor of refuge for ships or facilitate the landing of boats. There are only a few open bays along the 350 nautical mile stretch to Walvis Bay, which allow anchoring close to the beach, but without providing protection against the south-westerly swell, which is always strong on the west coast. In 1879, when the Cape government sent the ocean-going vessel "Swallow" with provisions to be landed for the so-called trekboats between Walvis Bay and Cape Frio, it was impossible to bring the goods ashore anywhere. The next notable point on the coast after leaving the mouth of the Cunene River is Cape Frio, 69 nautical miles away at 18° 23' s. Br. On September 26, 1884, H. M.'s gunboat "Möwe" anchored at a more northerly point, namely in 18° 2' s. Br. Br. off a crescent-shaped bay between two shallow sandy headlands. The landing craft made it easy to land in the interior of the bay, the flag was hoisted on land and a black, white and red pole with the inscription "Kaiserlich Deutsches Schutzgebiet" was erected on the dune opposite the landing site. The land around here makes a very desolate impression. If you cross the flat beach dune, you immediately reach a salt-soaked sandy plain, which is only interrupted by rows of white sand hills. The mountain range, which recedes quite far here, is constantly shrouded in a light haze due to the yellow sand dust. With out*) The Cunene was discovered by the English Captain Newman on January 24, 1824, at which time the river poured large quantities of water into the sea; when Captain Owen searched for the mouth of the river in November of the same year, there was no sign of it.

Page 284

 Apart from a single dry dune plant, there is no trace of organic life here. As we continued our journey, the "Möwe" spotted a settlement on the beach a few miles south of this bay, consisting of a hut or tent, a flagpole and a few boats pulled up on the beach. The "Seagull" passed quite close and hoisted the flag, but no living creature appeared. Cape Frio is low and consists of a tongue of sand, to the north of which lies a rock. The bay north of the cay offers no protection against the swell, which at times proves so significant that a steamer's engine has to run at full steam to keep the vessel steerable. Only slightly more fertile than Cape Frio, lies the False Cape Frio in 18° 27° s. Br. It has several shoals extending several cables outwards, and should therefore only be approached with caution. The bay between Cape Frio and the false Cape Frio, which measures about 5 nautical miles along the coast, extends in a north-easterly direction and offers no protection whatsoever. The next point worth noting as we continue south is Fort Rockspitze, 19° 6' s. Br. An English merchant named Carew claimed to have discovered a new harbor about 3 nautical miles above the point; however, a closer examination by the S.M. cruiser "Habicht" revealed that there is an untidal area at this point, which in calm seas may provide a protected anchorage for small coastal vessels and allow them to take on cargo, but in high swells the surf extends over the entire bay. From Fort Rockspitze, at 20° 5° s. Br. to the dangerous Rif Swallow Breakers. It was first observed by the English ship "Swallow" in 1879, after which the reef was named. The coast between Fort Rockspitze and Swallow Breakers is of the most desolate character; it shows low stony ridges, behind them high sand dunes, and in clear weather the peaks of the mountains stretching inland can be seen above the latter. The coastal fringe has the same character as you continue southwards, first to Palgrave=Sp. The Palgrave Point, a reef that extends 6 to 7 cable lengths into the sea in a north-westerly direction. It was named after the well-known negotiator who tried to mediate between the hostile tribes on behalf of the Cape government during the unrest between the Herero and Nama in the 1970s. The same man was also present as commissioner on the ship "Swallow", which, as already mentioned, was supposed to bring support to the Trek Boers in 1879, without succeeding in finding a suitable place to land. In 200 s. Br. S. M. cruiser "Habicht" discovered two breakthroughs, apparently river beds, in the high sand dunes that come close to the sea here, sometimes sloping steeply towards it.*) *) In about 21 Gr. s. Br. the Portuguese maps contain a harbor called Angra de St. Ambrosia. An English captain named Messum searched for it for 15 days without finding it. It is thought to have been buried by sandfalls from the dunes.
From Palgrave=Spitze we meet the next remarkable point at 21° 10" s. Br., the Ogden Rocks, a rocky coastline that interrupts the sand dunes. In 1832 the American Captain Morrell found a harbor at 20° 57" s. Br. Br.), which he described in more detail, but which had already disappeared by 1879. Palgrave assumes that the protective walls of the harbor were submerged or washed away by the rough seas; on the other hand, a silting up, which one would initially think of, is not to be assumed because the coast here is reefy everywhere. H.M. cruiser "Habicht" found in 1886 that since the visit of the English warship "Swallow" (1879) further changes must have taken place both north of Ogden Rocks and north of Palgrave Point. The aforementioned English warship had anchored at these points, which was not possible for the "Habicht". The swell here was so high that the engine had to be operated at full steam to keep the vessel under control. The difference found cannot be explained by the different state of the sea. The newer maps that still include Ogden Harbour are based on an error by Dr. Th. Hahn, who included this harbour in his map from Morrell's outdated map. The peculiar nature of the beach is particularly indicated by the Ogden Rocks, which lie about a nautical mile from the nearest point of the coast and are extremely dangerous. However, the coast is free of dangers, except for those mentioned in the map, which are already marked by surf. Further south, individual higher mountain cones of the mountain range running parallel to the coast come close to the sea. At 21° 31* s. Br., northeast of Kar Croß, Mount Dourissa, according to the name used by the natives, is the highest and most visible mountain cone. Its height above sea level is given by the "Africa Pilot" as about 1000 meters; on the south side it drops steeply, almost vertically, the west and east sides are very rugged. From here, after reaching 21° 42" s. Br. at a protruding point high on the land we see the wreck of a large iron ship, we reach Cape Croß at 21° 50" S. Br. Br., which projects in the shape of a truncated pyramid of moderate height about a nautical mile. It forms the spur of a chain of hills running inland in an easterly direction and is a good landmark for ships. It takes its name from a stone cross that was probably erected there by the Portuguese in 1486. The cape forms a bay to the north of it, in which, according to the reports of Korv.=Kapt. v. Schuckmann I, there is protection against southerly winds, but not against the swell. Two years earlier, in 1884, the "Möwe" anchored here, whose guide, Korv.=Kapt. Hoffmann, described the bay as a good anchorage, well protected from southerly winds, and described the cape as a low headland of white sand, which, with the reefs behind*) Captain Morrell sand, made the harbor quite safe from the southwesterly swell due to an offshore reef. There were various freshwater springs near the harbor and a native village about 11 kilometers away.

red sandstone hills. The same author objects to the description of the Afrika Pilot, but without attempting to explain the difference by the different water levels or by changes that have taken place. The soundings, landings and anchorages made by the English warship "Swallow" in 1879, on the other hand, were found to be correct. The "Möwe" also made a landing. On the hill opposite the landing site, a black, white and red pole was found with a plaque and the inscription: "From 26° to 18° s. Br. Br. with the exclusion of Walfischbai Imperial German Protectorate." Mosses and lichens were often seen between the blocks of red sandstone; a hyena was seen roaming around the landing site, later a shark and a snake were reportedly hunted, and a whole herd of seals was camped on the rocks in front of the cape itself. About 9 nautical miles south of Cape Croß, the flat and sandy coast opens up into a bay stretching from north to south, about 3 nautical miles wide, which is called Sierra Bai. It is open to the southerly and south-westerly winds, so that it offers no protection. Behind the bay, which is occasionally visited by whalers, an isolated mountain rises 200 meters high, an excellent landmark when coming from the south. Further south, at 22° 9" s. The Farilhao peak is described by the Africa Pilot as a dark, rocky peak of moderate elevation and sandy outcrop; nearby are two volcanic rocks, the Farilhaos. In April 1886, the S. M. cruiser "Habicht" did not confirm the information given by the Afrika Pilot (referring to Findlays in South Atlantic); the point proved to be a sand spit, but the rocks indicated were not seen. In 22° 55' s. Br. "Habicht" noticed a dry river bed, which was thought to be an arm of the Omaruru. The mouth of the Omaruru was found at 22° 7.4' s. Br. A survey of the Omaruru riverbed did not take place because the surf was so strong that a landing did not seem possible. From the Farilhao=spit we reach the mouth of the Sword at 22° 42' s. Br. to the mouth of the Swakop River, which forms the northern boundary of the English territory at Walvis Bay. The mouth of the Swakop was examined more closely in April 1886 by the S. M. cruiser "Habicht". It was completely closed by a barrage; to the south of this barrage are large stones, to the north is a shallow sandy beach. The commander landed with the surf boat on the rocks on the left bank of the river and crossed over to the right bank on the bar. The river bed is about 300 meters wide, but the water had only covered about the northern third part of the bed during the last rainy season, as the inspection showed. This part was still wet and covered with a thin layer of silt, while the rest of the riverbed was covered with bushes. Good drinking water is dug quite close to the beach in the riverbed during the dry season. In front of the mouth of the river, about 50 meters from the surf, there are 5 meters of water; the water depths increase regularly to the west. The surf was not found to be that strong; it will be possible The flagpole set by H.M. gunboat "Wolf", as well as the plaque with the inscription: "From 26° to 18° s. Br. Br. with the exclusion of Walsischbai under the protectorate of the German Reich" were found intact on the right bank of the Swakop. The next destination on our journey along the coast, which south of the Swakop is moderately high, sandy and dotted with individual peaks or rounded crests and very characteristic roof-like elevations, is Walsischbai. The westernmost point of the bay is Pelican Point, at 22° 53° 32" s. Br., which is 69 nautical miles from Cape Croß and forms the northern tip of a sandy peninsula 4 nautical miles long. The entrance to the bay is about 4 nautical miles wide. The western side and center of the bay are shallow and interspersed with sandbars, so that larger vessels must anchor at a distance of 2-3 nautical miles from land. The eastern side is deeper, but offers little protection against swell; landing and loading operations often have to be interrupted here. While high dunes rise up close to the beach on the eastern side, the surrounding land on the southern and western sides is so flat that it is submerged by the tide at high tide. The factory is built on artificially raised ground at considerable cost. The fresh drinking water is brought in large barrels on donkeys about 24 nautical miles from the settlement. To the south of the bay, the Kuisip River flows into the sea, and its breakthrough through the high dunes provides a fairly easy connection to the interior of the country. The lower course of the Kuisip is an underground river, only once every 5 to 10 years does it reach the sea during the rainy season. From 1878 to 1884, Walfischdai and its immediate surroundings were in the direct possession of England, and were then incorporated into the Cape Colony. On March 12, 1878, the commander of the warship "Industry", Dyer, placed this territory under English protectorate in the name of the Queen of England; the boundaries were determined as follows: On the south by a line from a point on the coast, 15 scemeiles south from Pelican Point to Scheppmansdorf; on the east by a line from Scheppmanddorf to Rooi=Kop, including the plateau, and thereon to the point on the Swakop, which is 10 English miles from the mouth of the river following the river, on the north the said 10 English miles of the lower course of the Swakop Dr. H. Bokemeyer. (Conclusion follows.) The Halfa. To exploit the natural plant resources of our colonies is, as we have often shown, one of the first tasks of the German colonizers, which, if properly tackled, must also bring worthwhile profits. It is not only the extraction of tobacco. Cocoa, cotton and other articles which play an important role on the world market, but also those products which nature has generously produced in almost inexhaustible abundance, but which today are hardly worth the effort of collecting and only play a modest role in the export figures as by-products of the factories. There are various reasons for this. Firstly, the natives are not very inclined to give up their old habits of trade and the production of objects which always promise good sales, and secondly, the prices of the products are so low that only mass processing is worthwhile for the exporters. The competition from countries with dense working populations is fierce, the construction of new factories and the installation of machinery costly, so that the entrepreneur then prefers to continue working in the old, well-trodden paths. Special means are therefore required, such as the granting of privileges (see under "Small notices"), to encourage entrepreneurs to turn their attention to such promising but risky work. In modern times, there has been lively interest in bast plants, which are particularly rich in our West African colonies, as the "Hamburg" exhibition, which we have reported on in detail, has shown, and proposals for their exploitation and introduction have emerged from various quarters,*) of which we hope that one or the other will make use. For, as the economic histories of many countries have shown, it is precisely on the basis of these fibers that a lively upswing in trade and the flourishing of a new industry has taken place. A good example in this direction is the halfa or esparto, about which an estimable essay by Wilhelm Joseph Wallraff was published in issue 3 of the Deutsche Geographische Blätter (published by the Geographische Gesellschaft in Bremen), which we refer to in the following remarks. The Arabic word Halfa (Stipa tenacissima and some other species) is used by the indigenous population of North Africa to designate several perennial plant species of the Stipaceae family, which clothe the driest soil of the Mediterranean countries in the form of cushion- or broom-shaped tufts forming tall and stiff turfs. Particularly characteristic are its tough, rush-like leaves, which vary greatly in length from species to species and are characterized by great flexibility and strength, making them particularly suitable for braiding. It is usually found in arid areas rich in sand, clay, marl or limestone, where it tends to occupy those parts of the soil that allow rainwater to run off and thus prevent the accumulation of sodium salts, which are harmful to its development. On the Iberian Peninsula, the esparto districts form one of the numerous subdivisions of the mat formation, which are spread over a large part of the country due to the plateau climate and the favorable metcorological conditions. The plant thrives best in the area of the *) Siebe page 356 of the Deutsche Kolonialzeitung (1889), where a defibering machine was also discussed.

 The littoral between Almeria and Alicante, opposite the province of Oran, where it often covers extensive areas with its cushions to the exclusion of all other vegetation. In the hinterland of this coastal stretch, in the barren and rainless hilly landscapes of the provinces of Alicante, Murcia and Granada, it is still found in considerable populations. In North Africa, the halfa is much more widespread, especially on the plateaus of Algiers. In particular, it is often the dominant plant for miles in the broader western part of the plateau and covers those vast plains which, because of the undulating movement of the individual clumps of halfa when the wind blows, bear the excellent name mers d'alla or ocean d'alsa. In the part of the plateau that continues towards Morocco, the halfa seems to be just as widespread as in Oran. In this country it also covers considerable stretches on the northern slopes of the Atlas in the provinces of Keira and Sektana, and is also found sparsely along the entire northern coast. However, the poor transport routes and, above all, the little interest shown by the government of this country in exploiting the products of the interior in trade and industry, only permit the exploitation of this valuable article in the provinces of Chiadma and Haha on the west coast, from where the halfa is brought and shipped to the neighboring port of Mogador. In the province of Algiers, the Halfa reaches as far south as the watershed of the Oued Djedi and the Qued Mia, so here it penetrates into the Sahara region. Compared to the other two provinces, the halfa districts of Constantine are insignificant in terms of area and density of the population, as the widespread montane region only allows the occurrence of large plains in a few places. The southern border of the Halfa forms a line from Biskra to Regrine, the northern border coincides more or less with the edge of the plateau. It grows most densely in the area around Sétif, Constantine and Souk=Arras. The Halsa formation is also very widespread in the regency of Tunis. With the exception of the northern coastal strip, it extends over all undeveloped plains and plateaus, some of which still belong to the steppe formation. In the south, the Schotts form the border. On the east coast it can be found in the plain north of Sfax and on the Kerkennah Islands opposite, near Gabes and on the Matmata and Hauia plateaus to the southwest of the dune formation. Actual half-ameras, however, only exist in the area between the Oued=Zerrad and the Chott el Djerid. In Tripolitania, the Halfa is limited to the pre-desert extending to the coast and the plateau south of Tripoli. The ancients already knew and processed the halfa, but it was not until 1857 that a new epoch in the history of the esparto began, when the Englishman Routledge recognized its significant fibre content and its excellent usability in the paper industry. In the same year, the first shiploads were extracted in Spanish ports, and in 1863 exports from Algiers began, making esparto an important export in all countries of the western Mediterranean basin, and even the most important export in Tripolitania. At present, the exploitation of esparto land is most extensive in Algeria, the main producing country. For an annual rent of only 10 cents per hectare, the government often cedes extensive districts to companies and large industrialists, usually for 3, 6 or 9 years. The Franco-Algerian company has long had the privilege of exploiting those vast semi-seas of the province of Oran that extend south of Seddou and Saida to the Chott el Cherqui (2-300,000 hectares), while the areas of Aln=Toua and Batna in the province of Constantine are exploited by the Société Agricole et Industrielle. Until August 1887, an English company in Tunis had similar privileges over an area of 1,024,124 hectares. Since the abolition of these privileges by the French, however, trade has been free. Exploitation is carried out by an entrepreneur who concludes a contract with the large industrialist or the company which has been granted a concession by the government over a precisely defined area, in which it is stipulated how many tons and at what price he undertakes to deliver the halfa of the district in question. At harvest time, he has several wooden huts erected in the vicinity, in which, in addition to bad food and drink, there is also a lever scale, and instructs the individual managers to weigh and pay cash for the harvest brought in. There is usually no shortage of loose fodder here. Some are natives, sprightly men such as women, old men and children, and some are Spaniards (esparteros) who run this business. Most of these Spaniards come from the coast opposite the province of Oran, whose inhabitants have been familiar with the collection and utilization of esparto since the time of Pliny. In 1881, the total population of Algeria was 3,254,913, including no less than 112,047 Spaniards. Their number has increased in recent years to 114,326. They have undoubtedly introduced the Arabs and Berbers of North Africa to the more rational method of exploitation customary in Spain, and have thus made it possible to meet the enormous needs of trade. They have more strength, dexterity and endurance at work than the natives. If the Arab collects at most 150-200 kg of halfa a day for ten hours of work, the Espartero achieves twice that. The price that the entrepreneur pays for the common halfa of the plateau was up to 40 Fres. per ton in the better years, today it has fallen to 15-20 Fres. depending on the quality. Nevertheless, a sprightly worker could still make a good profit if he were not forced to buy his food from the entrepreneur's canteen at a high price. The leaves can be collected in various ways. Nowadays, a stick about 40 em long is usually used everywhere, which is held by the left hand while the right hand wraps a handful of ripe leaves around the end of the stick and then pulls them out of the leaf sheaths with a strong pull. This procedure requires great effort and is observed almost exclusively by the Esparteros. The weaker halfas gatherers (children, women and old people) use leather gloves to grasp one or more stalks at a time and pull them out, a procedure which, of course, causes less damage to the halfas stick, as only rarely more than the intended part of the plant follows, but which would reduce the harvest by half if it were used exclusively. This is because it only allows half as much to be collected (18-20 kg per hour) as the first method. Cutting the stalks with sickles or scythes in the manner of our stalks, as Rohlfs observed among the Arabs of Tripolitania, is prohibited for Algeria by Article 2 of the decree of December 14, 1888. Although it allows the advantage of rapid exploitation, it is at the same time highly inefficient, as the bare culms are only able to provide usable material again after 5-6 years. In 1883, the number of workers employed in Algeria to collect the halfa was approximately 10,000, and the area of exploited land amounted to 2,000,000 hectares. One hectare of the high plateaus can often yield up to 1½ tons of green (still undried) leaves with an average occupancy of 3-5000 halfa bunches, but usually not more than 1 ton of dried leaves. Drying takes place at the harvesting site and takes 3-5 days. The goods lose 15-18 percent of their weight as a result. It is then taken to the port of export and either subjected to laborious processing by women and children or immediately formed into large bales like cotton and shipped. As far as the volume of exports is concerned, Spain's exports in 1888 amounted to 44,551,136 tons of unprocessed material and 5,144,547 tons of processed material worth about 9 million pesetas. Algiers exported 80 947 649 tons worth 9632 442 francs in 1887, while Tunis exported 13779 tons. For Tripolitania, the halfa is the first export article and amounted to 69,000 tons worth 5,301,000 francs in 1888. For the time being it is hardly to be supposed that we shall obtain in our colonies fibrous materials of the importance of the Halsa, but if in North Africa the abundance of one species of plant is a tremendous advantage, it must be remembered, on the other hand, that the West African colonies already produce dozens of species of fibrous materials, some of which are present in surprising quantities. The value of Africa. In the Nineteenth Century, the African traveler H. H. Johnston, British consul in Mozambique, who is not exactly favorably known among us for his hatred of Germany, gives a concise answer to those of his compatriots who underestimate the value of Africa and mock the new agreements, which on the one hand is quite suitable. German opponents of an extended African colonial policy of the empire a better understanding of the value of African possessions, and on the other hand shows the friends of the colonial political movement how far England's power actually already extends.

Page 287
 
and how surprisingly far an Englishman is already extending this power to vast territories at a moment's notice, over which no agreements have yet been made, and how he values every territory, even the smallest, and insists on its assertion. Mr. Johnston is well qualified to speak authoritatively on these matters, for he has already been five times in an official position in Africa and knows a large part of Africa from his own experience. "I have become convinced," he says, "after all my experience on the spot, that the parts of Africa in which we are interested, or which we are endeavoring to acquire, are of value to the British nation, and even necessary to the tendency to extend the empire. Indeed, if one does not wish to believe in the expansive power of the Empire, then one may at least discourage the attempts of our people to "seek new territories for our activities", and consequently oppose all African acquisitions. But if you believe, as I do, with heart and soul and mind, in the continued, well-ordered, farther extension of the British Empire as an empire of peace and liberty, of civilization and profitable enterprise, then you will approve of the creation and the conquest of the British African territories, which are new markets for our manufactures, and new homes for the increase of our population, whether that increase be from the British Isles or from British India. Governor Sir John Pope Hennessy (against whose criticisms Johnston's reply was first directed) admits that we should keep the Cape and Sierra Leone, the latter for the sake of the coal stations, in Africa; so he does want us to give up the rest. Let us see what this "rest" of our African possessions is worth. These exist in our western colonies of Gambia (Sierra Leone is to remain with us). Gold Coast and Lagos, the Niger=protected areas, British Central Africa with the Nyassa Tanganvika and Trans=Sambese=areas. Sanstbar, British East Africa and British Somaliland. The Gambia, the oldest colony, which began its relations with England in 1588 through a trading company whose charter was granted by Queen Elizabeth, is held in little esteem by many people, since in the course of time France took all the land around it and restricted our sphere of influence to a narrow strip along the river banks. Gambia's trade, import and export, amounts to about 220,000 pounds annually. About half of this comes from England, the other half from France. The area of the colony is not quite 100 square miles, but its sphere of influence is wider. The main value of The Gambia lies in its magnificent navigable river, which allows the most convenient access to the heart of Senegambia. This fact makes the Gambia a desirable possession for France, and so it is not wrongly said that France could have made a trade here for concessions in Newfoundland and the Pacific Ocean. But the same is not true of our other western plantations. We have to keep Sierra Leone - Sir John admits this - for strategic reasons. The Gold Coast is a flourishing colony, although the mineral and plant products there are only being exploited to a small extent. Its annual trade amounts to 814,000 pounds, of which more than three quarters - 612,000 pounds - are traded with England, primarily with Liverpool. We have here a busy, industrious population of about 1500,000 inhabitants who, thanks to the efforts of the Basel Mission, have supplied us with many useful workers on the west coast in recent years: Commis, carpenters, joiners, bricklayers, machinists, plumbers, cooks. Servants. In the interior live warlike Haussa, from whom we train our police. The Gold Coast, properly developed and exploited, will be a most valuable possession for us. Then comes Lagos, the Liverpool of West Africa, a small strip of coastal land in front of our Niger= shooting range, barely 1071 square miles in size, but with 100,000 inhabitants and an annual turnover of 950,000 pounds, more than half of which is negotiated with England. Lagos and the Gold Coast are also necessary to us because they flank our splendid Niger Protectorate. This extends along the Seclüste from the Lagos border on the Benin River to the German Cameroon border on the Rio del Rey and inland up the Niger and the Bennä beyond the kingdoms of Nupe and Sokoto to the edge of the Sahara and the Egyptian Sudan. (Such a wide extension of the Niger Protectorate is probably more in line with Johnston's wishes than the facts. D. R.) The control of the Niger Protectorate is in the hands of the Roval Niger Chartered Company, which, in addition to many hundreds of indigenous servants, has an official staff of 70-80 Europeans, 700 policemen as an armed force and a fleet of 25 steamers (? D. R.). A considerable part of the territory of the Niger Delta and of Old=Kalabar is at present directly administered by Royal Consuls. In this, the so-called Ol River area, about 150 Englishmen are not included. The employees of the Royal Niger Company increase the number of white compatriots to about 220, who carry on a trade of about three million pounds with Great Britain. There are two missionary societies in the area, the Church Missionary Society and the United Presbyterian Mission, which are making great progress among the non-Mohamedan blacks. These two societies have a total of 17 or 18 stations. Their expenses amount to £13,627 for the Church Missionary Society, and at least £6,000 to £7,000 for the United Presbyterian Mission, which works especially in Old Kalabar, so that £2,000 a year is spent in the service of civilization. The government population under our control certainly amounts to seven to eight million, but another twenty million may well be in direct or indirect contact with England, receiving advice from officials of the Niger Company or royal officials. From the Niger district we receive several metals, such as silver and antimony, many ores of the plant world, especially palm oil, wood and the like, as well as ivory. We send Manchester trunks, Birmingham tools, Cheshire salt and London seize, Indian silks and West Indian tabal. Our possessions in West Africa, with the omission of Gambia, which we do not want to regard as a quantité négligeable, but as a négociablo, negotiate a total of about five million pounds with England, give honorable employment to 770 compatriots and bring at least 5 million intelligent (Sierra Leone), strong (Kru=Men), industrious (Goldkuste), industrious (Poruba), brave (Niger). san te (Oil=Rivers) Negroes under our just, enlightened, educated regime. I was more elaborate about West Africa than about our possessions in the South. East or in the middle of the continent, because in West Africa the English trade and the English are more directly and exclusively concerned than in other parts of the empire. It may be said that trade with West Africa, and the use of Englishmen there, has relations with Great Britain alone, and that undoubtedly the interests of our Great British population of 35 millions must count as much as the interests of 200,000 of our fellow-subjects in Newfoundland, and those of four millions in Australasia, let us think Lagos, the Gold Coast, or the Niger, against concessions from France or Germany in the Pacific or Atlantic Ocean: the loss to the inhabitants of Great Britain would be greater than the gain to the Anstralians or Newfoundlanders To those who think that our merchants and missionaries would participate in West Africa to the same extent if our possessions were transferred to another power, I only reply: How many English merchants are in French Senegambia! How much is England's trade with the French, German, Belgian and Portuguese possessions in West Africa compared to that with British possessions? (About 400,000 pounds against five million!) Can the British missionaries work in French Africa? Even in the most enlightened, free-minded administrative area in Africa, in German Cameroon, the British Baptist Mission had to leave when, after forty years of work, the country became German! We therefore do not want to blame other governments. The fault lies in our peculiar jdiosyncrasy as a nation. We are headstrong, quirky, lacking in adaptability and quite patient when governed by compatriots, but extremely impatient under a foreign regime." Thus, while our West African possessions have become a necessity for the trade of London, Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds. Sheffield, Bristol, Liverpool, our newly acquired territories in South Central Africa are a necessity for the expansion of our trade relations and as an area of emigration for our growing South African confederation, whose population amounts to over 2 million and whose trade with England amounts to over 18 million pounds. Sanstbar and British East Africa, on the other hand, are necessary, firstly, as a defensive barrier to our southern access to Ugppten, and secondly for the trade and emigration of our great Indian empire with its 300 million people and a trade with England amounting to 90 million pounds. Finally, British Somaliland is a necessity for the maintenance of our flourishing colony of Aden. The total trade of the British Empire with British Africa (excluding Egypt) amounts to more than 25,200,000 pounds a year. Of the valuable products exported by British Africa, only the following are worth mentioning: Gold (West and South Africa). Silver (West Africa), copper (South and Central Africa), coal (South West Africa), diamonds (South Africa), ivory (West, South and East Africa), palm oil (West Africa, 22 pounds a ton), palm kernels (West Africa, 12 pounds 12 shillings a ton), rubber (West and East Africa, 15-100 pounds a ton), cotton (West and East Africa, 50-60 pounds a ton). Timber, jndigo, coffee, sugar, rice, cinnamon, peppercorns, horses (Somaliland and South Africa). Cattle, donkeys, hides and many other valuable goods. This paltry little discussion is probably enough to give some people a different concept of the "value of Africa". So much for Consul Johnston's remarks on England's possessions in Africa. The friends of our German colonial discussions will do well to carefully collect and compile all material about our colonies and, in the event of a polemic with our opponents, to utilize it to produce such striking answers as that of the Englishman. R. A. Körnig. Colonial Review. South America. ( Brazil. Contrary to many expectations, the Republic of the United States of Brazil has, in the first year of its existence, been able to maintain itself free from serious political upheavals, sa, it is already so firmly established that even monarchical states such as England, Portugal and Italy have no longer had any hesitation in officially recognizing it, and it should also be assured of recognition by all other states that have hesitated to do so. Who could deny that the men of the revolution of November 15, 1889, who stood at the head of the new state, were able to guide the reins of government with energy and prudence and to alleviate the hardships of dictatorship by introducing contemporary reforms? The elevation of the former provinces to autonomous and confederate states, the separation of church and state, the introduction of freedom of religion and civil marriage, the reorganization of the natural system, and the fact that the British Baptist Mission had to leave the Cameroon region because the German government was putting too much pressure on it through administrative channels is a completely false assertion. The British mission simply made itself impossible. It is well known that a number of English missions are active in the German protectorates of East Africa. D. R.

 The reform of the financial and banking system with the express purpose of granting foreigners living in Brazil the same political rights as the natives, the reform of the financial and banking system in the sense of raising industry and agriculture. Innovations that had already been sought by the more advanced elements of popular representation at the time of the empire, but which could not be implemented because of the opposition to them, partly from the Crown and partly from the clerical-nativist coalition in the Imperial Diet, were passed into law at the stroke of a pen by the head of the provisional government, thus laying the foundations for a more rapid and prosperous development of the country. There is currently an extraordinarily lively activity in all areas of practical business, which - as we will see below - is not always to be seen as an economically healthy phenomenon, but at least demonstrates the confidence that is placed in the country's political situation in the widest circles. It should not be denied, however, that the provisional government also made great mistakes and thus incurred the enmity of some well-meaning people. By excluding the clergy from the right to vote, they and their followers, who should not be underestimated, have been driven into the ranks of the opposition, which will now be up in arms against all ecclesiastical reforms, and through electoral interference of the worst kind and arbitrary deprivation of the right to vote, the officials and supporters of the provisional government have raped their opponents to such an extent that they have kept away from the elections altogether in order not to ignite a civil war. Under these circumstances, the soon to convene Constituent Congress is unlikely to express the true will of the people and only formally abolish the dictatorship, for in reality the power of government will remain in the hands of the previous rulers, and it will therefore depend on them what course the development of the country will take. In our opinion, the economic situation is nothing less than favorable. Although the country still has unlimited credit and the exchange rate of the currency has not fallen as low as was feared at the time of the revolution, the financial system is deteriorating noticeably. The expenses for the administration and especially for the Lord, on whom the government must rely, have increased to the same extent that import duties, the country's main source of income, have decreased. An attempt is now being made to make up for the shortfall by increasing the tariff, but this will only make the country's situation worse, and in particular the attempt to emancipate itself from foreign countries by subsidizing domestic industry will be a miserable fiasco, for a country like Brazil, which has to cover its coal requirements by importing it from England and which has neither cheap capital nor cheap and skilled labour, is not in a position to compete with foreign industry; the subsidies granted, which have kindled a founding fever the like of which has hardly ever been seen in the old and new world, have simply been thrown away and will only achieve their purpose to some extent in very rare cases. We also consider the government's measures to promote immigration and colonization to be misguided. Instead of proceeding from the ground up in a reforming manner in the field of agricultural policy and laying the foundations for rational colonization by means of exact surveying, assessment and cadastrization of the large land concessions, taxation of uncultivated land, etc. In order to lay the foundations for rational settlement, foreign agents and steamship companies are subsidized, as in the days of the empire, to bring in immigrants, and the settlement of the latter is also left to large landowners and land speculators with the assurance of high subsidies under conditions that do not offer the settler the slightest guarantee of advancement. They even went so far as to transport the European emigrants from their place of residence to Brazil completely free of charge, but did not consider that this only gave the European governments a new weapon to suppress emigration to Brazil. If the Drasillan government had taken it upon itself to establish large, viable and well-managed settlements on fertile land and to improve the conditions for the advancement of the individual colonist, spontaneous immigration would not have been long in coming, for every well-situated colonist is anxious to have his relatives and friends join him, while the large sums currently being spent by the state to promote immigration will at best serve to direct the flow of emigration to Brazil only temporarily, in order to stem it for a longer period later, when countless livelihoods will have been destroyed as a result of the completely inadequate frontiers for mass colonization. How little people in Brazil are aware of the duties they have to fulfill towards the immigrants can be seen, among other things, in an article in the Germania of Sko Paulo, which is so warmly in favour of the present government and the institutions it has set up. It reports on the fate of a family of German colonists who arrived in Brazil on the Lloyd steamer Buenos Apres, which foundered on the Jlha dos Ratos, and were initially accommodated in the large immigration house on Biumen Island in the port of Rio, Brazil's hospitality garden. Disease and death raged in the most merciless manner in all the families who were accommodated there, and the food was the worst imaginable. A terrible number of the children in particular perished as a result of poor food and polluted air, as well as a lack of cleanliness and the necessary washing and clothing. Of 7 German families who had to endure 5 weeks (!) there, only one was spared death. Several families lost 2 to children. The Wiegner family was particularly hard hit. Four children aged 10 months to 10 years died during this time and the last child from Wiegner's second marriage, a boy of 6 years, died a few days after his arrival in Sao Paulo as a result of his illness in the immigration house, which in the opinion of the doctor in Sao Paulo was solely due to bad air and poor nutrition. The "Germania" expresses its indignation at the immigration authorities in very harsh terms and accuses them of notorious incompetence and even worse; we, however, bring the case to public attention in order to show how disastrous it can be for the German emigrant if he allows himself to be determined to emigrate to Brazil in view of the free passage that is granted to him. We consider the entire way in which colonization is currently carried out in Brazil to be so flawed that we could only support emigration to Brazil if the emigrants were offered the necessary guarantee of good accommodation and suitable settlement among fellow tribesmen by reliable German colonization companies or relatives or friends living there, a guarantee which, of course, the agents of the Brazilian government do not provide, nor are they able to provide in Uruguay. Little has changed in the political situation of the country since our last report, but the economic situation has undergone some remarkable changes. In 1888 imports amounted to 29,500,000 pesos and exports to 28,000,000 pesos; in 1889 the former rose to 37,000,000 pesos, while the latter fell to 26,000,000 pesos. Customs revenue rose from 8,846,000 in 1888 to 10,785,000 in 1889. The entire economic activity experienced a fairly lively upswing in the latter year, especially as immigration also showed an increase of 10,000 souls over the previous year, in which it had amounted to only 17,000 souls. The capital Montevideo expanded by 830 new buildings in 1889 and many important undertakings were also started in the interior of the country. - The latest news indicates that the present situation is nothing less than favorable. As a result of the severe suppression of the smuggling trade on the Brazilian frontier by the Brazilian Government, the most important outlet has been taken away from the importers of Montevideo; four large houses have already had to suspend their payments, and four others appear to be already very shaky; consequently, imports have decreased so considerably that the Minister of Finance intends to make up for the loss in customs duties by raising the tariff, which, however, is likely to cut the trade's lifelines even more. Argentina. We will not comment here on the July Revolution, which overthrew President Celman and at times caused anarchic conditions in Buenos Ayres and even in distant parts of the country, as our readers have been sufficiently informed about these events by the daily press and their description in the present report would far exceed the space allotted to us. As a result of the former president's mismanagement, the country's financial situation has become downright bleak; the entire economy must suffer from this, however, and it is therefore not surprising that the papers report a general discouragement of the productive forces, lack of work, workers' demonstrations, fallissements, etc. Added to this is the plague of locusts, which has hit the most fertile farming colonies in Entre Rios, and finally the complete helplessness of the government in the face of the task of opening up new sources of financial aid for the country and increasing economic activity - in short, it is a crisis whose end is not yet in sight. Chile. The situation in Chile is not much better than in Argentina. The "Deutsche Nachrichten", published in Valparaiso, paints the internal political situation in gray, but in particular it paints a very bleak picture of the economic situation. The political turmoil is not only bringing the entire government machine to a standstill, as no taxes are being paid, but is also damaging the country's credit in a perhaps unhealthy way, as can be seen from the rapid deterioration in the value of the Chilean currency. Ardite riots are the order of the day, as there is a lack of work opportunities everywhere and virtually nothing is being done for colonization. If the immigrants are not supported by their compatriots or bring some subsistence resources from home, they perish, because the government does not care about them and even tries to make it as difficult as possible for them to get ahead. President Balmaceda is an outspoken hater of foreigners and has repeatedly expressed this attitude by replacing the foreign workers employed in the state workshops with local workers, even if they were in no way able to meet the demands placed on them. The railroad from Valparaiso to Santiago, for example, had to stop its freight service completely for several days because the foreign machinists had been annoyed away, and the passengers on the passenger trains run by Chileans were in danger of their lives. Why, under these circumstances, the Chilean government is still recruiting immigrants through its agents in Vordeaux, under the lying promise that they will find rewarding work in Chile, and then using the trick of stating the value of the Chilean thaler as 5 francs or lire, is simply incomprehensible. In any case, German workers must be strongly advised not to emigrate to Chile, as they do not have the slightest prospect of making a good living there at present. Correspondence. PRagru varderer) Letters from Tanga. September 25, 1890: In the history of the development of our German East African colonies, Tanga seems to occupy a very peculiar position. While on the one hand it enjoys the greatest esteem on the part of colonial circles, it is treated differently on the other,

Page 289

which stands in stark contrast to this appreciation. Whoever wants to spend capital on the development of East Africa in recent times will first look to Tanga and its hinterland. The German planters' society has founded a branch in Amboni, two hours away from Tanga, the Magdeburg trading company has established itself in Tanga, the German East African Sea Trading Company has chosen Tanga and its hinterland as the area of its activities, and the representative of the ill-fated Somali expedition is currently looking for favorable places to establish plantations in the same area. Of all the private commercial companies, only the German East African Plantation Company has not settled in the vicinity of Tanga. But it can hardly be doubtful that after the construction of the Usambara Railway it will also send its products to Tanga and not to the harborless Pangani. No place in East Africa, with the exception of Sansidar, can therefore boast of accommodating an equally large number of Germans. The following figures will prove this. There are Germans in Tanga: 7 with the Schutztruppe, 6 with the Deutsch=Ostafrikanische Gesellschaft, 2 with the mission, 4 with the DeutschOstafrikanische Seebandlung, 5 with the Pflanzergesellschaft, 1 with the Magdeburger Handelsgesellschaft, 1 with the Somali expedition, one restaurateur and one shoemaker. These 27 Germans, including 3 women and 2 children, will soon be joined by some new officials from the local companies and by the wife of one of them. The reasons for the influx of capital and people in this one place are easily recognizable. Above all, Tanga enjoys the best climate in the entire German-East African coast. Some time ago, reports on the state of health of the Schutztruppe led to the opposite conclusion. However, given the frequent transfers of its members, such conclusions appear unfounded. It is precisely because of the climate found in Tanga that sick officers have often been sent there to recover their health. The illnesses they had to endure in Tanga were then wrongly attributed to the climate there instead of that of their former places of residence. No less decisive for the attraction of Tanga to German capital is the fact that Tanga has the best harbor on the German coast. The first voyage of the subsidized East Africa Line proved this most strikingly. The "Reichstag" entered the port of Tanga without the slightest difficulty. "Eight fathoms, no bottom - ten fathoms, no bottom - thirteen fathoms, no bottom," were the orders of the pilot until shortly before the ship anchored, and in the port itself the draft of the "Reichstag" was several meters less than the water depth. Even if Dar=es=Salaam has a larger harbor that is just as well protected against the monsoons as Tanga, the entrance to it is so narrow and so winding that it seems extremely precarious for the East African Line to expose its steamers to the danger of suffering the same fate as the "Reichstag". However, no one knows the excellence of the port of Tanga better than our navy, which preferred to stay in Tanga during the uprising and still prefers to go there for target practice. Nothing has made this appreciation of Tanga on the part of the navy more visible than the erection of the naval memorial in this very place, which only played a relatively insignificant role in the whole battle. I will discuss the third reason for Tanga's preference, the fertility of its hinterland, in more detail later. Here I would just like to interject a suggestion for a name. When people talk about the hinterland of Tanga, they usually use the name Usambara. But that is wrong. For Usambara is only one landscape of this hinterland, whose name cannot be extended to the whole area without causing confusion. I believe that Tangaland would be a correct and euphonious name for it. If, as is intended, the whole of German East Africa is later divided into three large districts with the suburbs of Tanga, Dar es=Salaam and Lindi, then in my opinion the best names for these would be Tangaland Mittelland and Lindiland. The division of German East Africa planned in this way is now in striking contradiction to the district division recently made by the Reichskommissariat. While Major von Wißmann, correctly recognizing the natural advantages of Tanganyika, made it the capital of the entire Tangaland, in his absence the deputy Reichskommissar Dr. Schmidt divided this district into two, whereby almost the entire fertile Tangaland was allocated to Pangani, which has no villages, and Tangaber only a minimal part of it, but otherwise only uninhabited steppe. This is all the more regrettable as the current chief of Tanga, Mr. Prime Minister Krenzler, has shown an extraordinary amount of interest in the economic conditions of the areas under his control, and - among other things through his energetic suggestions for the planting of sesame - is also very concerned about improving these conditions. He would therefore be the right man to administer such a promising area as the whole of Tangaland with real colonizing success, and he must now limit himself to devoting his skills to the coastal strip from Tangata to Wanga and the Nyika steppe behind it - with the exclusion of the inhabited settlements of Pangani, which are expressly included. Even more striking than the deputy imperial commissioner's neglect of Tangata is the stipulation that this place is not to be called at by the main line of subsidized East African steamships. What could have given rise to this is indeed unclear. In the interest of the German colonization of East Africa, the Reich supports a steamship line with almost one million marks annually. This line calls at a myriad of ports, including two in Portuguese colonies, but only one port in the German protectorate. On the other hand, the place that has the best port and in which our entire colonizing activity in Africa is concentrated at the same time, the place that was chosen as the starting point for the first German-African railroad, the place that has a hinterland that is not rich in ivory but is already extremely productive, is incredibly not called at. All the objections raised against the call at Tanga by the shareholders of the steamship company, especially by the Zanzibar merchants with a strong interest in the non-dispersal of the coast, have proved to be invalid. The port has not proved to be incapable of receiving large ships, as was claimed, and the loss of time is not so great as to prevent the Portuguese ports from being reached in the future in the same time as provided for in the current timetable. For although the "Reichstag" had already lost 40 hours by calling at Lamu, it nevertheless arrived in Zanzibar on the scheduled day despite anchoring in Tanga, which was permitted as an exception. If it is further objected that Tanga could not yet give enough cargo to the steamers to make it worthwhile to call there, the answer is simple: It is precisely for this reason that the Reich is providing the subsidy. The steamship line is to start production, and because the company's means would not suffice for this, but the empire has a lively interest in this incentive, it supports the company with its money - and not only to increase trade with Zanzibar and the Portuguese possessions. The "Reichstag" has received such large return cargoes and the line in Mozambique has been promised so much cargo for the future that its profitability is beyond question. It therefore seems to me to be a duty of honor for the shareholders to take on the 2,000 marks in costs that the one-day stay in Tanga on the outward journey and the return journey will cause them at most, and thereby do some justice to the purposes for which it was created in the first place. However, it is up to the Reich to insist on a change in the timetable to this effect, as such a change must be regarded as an inevitable consequence of the German-English agreement. No further justification is needed for the fact that with the prospective increase in the German population in Tanga, the establishment of a doctor there appears to be unavoidable. However, I will go further and claim that no better place than Tanga could be chosen for the new hospital of the German-African Missionary Society to be built on the coast. The climate alone would contribute greatly to the recovery of the sick brought from elsewhere, and the proximity of the mountains, whose connection to the coast by railroad will not be too long in coming, would allow the convalescents to quickly and comfortably reach high places for their complete recovery. May the leading personalities therefore not hesitate to begin their philanthropic work in Tanga, and thus also contribute to the concentration of all solitary forces on one point, which would be of incalculable benefit for the beginning of our colonizing work in Africa. Dr. Karl Kaerger. News from the Society. Today we are once again in the position of being able to acknowledge a large number of contributions which have been sent to us or to the paying agent of the aforementioned foundation to support Emin and von Wißmann (for the African sea steamers), as well as for the purposes of the Karl Peters Foundation. We can only thank once again the kind donors who have contributed to the one and the other foundation. Dr. Emin, von Wißmann and Dr. Peters can vouch sufficiently through their past that their plans can only be directed towards the prosperity and flourishing of our East African colony. When a note recently appeared in the daily press to the effect that Dr. Peters intends to use the funds collected by the Karl Peters Foundation to establish a trading post in Uganda, we are authorized to declare that this news is entirely without factual justification. For the fulfillment of the important tasks which the deserving men have set themselves, they are dependent on the helpfulness of patriotic private circles. The given goals can only be achieved with private means, as the funds available from the Reich are too small to properly realize and exploit the advantages arising in Jnnernafrika to the desired extent. We would therefore like to join our thanks to the request that further support be given to the two funds mentioned, whose current balance is not yet sufficient for the next purpose: the construction of one steamer each for the Victoria-Ryanza and the Tanganpika. We would also like to take this opportunity to point out that the lectures given by Dr. Peters. Captain Richelmann and Lieutenant von Tiedemann on their experiences and findings in East Africa are particularly suitable for providing information and instruction on the tasks at hand in Inner Africa. J. A.: Dr. Bolemeyer, Secretary General.

 The Society's committee held a meeting on November 4 under the chairmanship of Privy Councillor Simon, at which the applications of the Mühlheim department were discussed. This was followed by a discussion of pending colonization projects and a presentation by the Secretary General on the status of the new formation of the Brunswick department. The statutes of the Iserlohn and Koblenz sections were approved and a final decision was taken for the board meeting on December 11. New departments were founded in the following cities: - Langenberg (Rhineland), with 23 members, founded on October 23, 1890, 1st chairman Arnold Diergardt, 1st secretary and treasurer Gottfried Conze sun.; - Düren, with 46 members, founded on October 22, 1890, 1st chairman Phil. Schoeller, 2nd chairman Kom=Rat Bücklers, 1st secretary Gym=Dir. Dr. Weidgen, treasurer Rud. Schoeller; - Giessen, with 80 members, founded on October 27, 1890, 1st chairman Pros. Joh. Schmidt, 1st secretary bookseller Fürber, treasurer, bookseller Reimer, assessor factory owner Ed. Röhrle - Höchst a. M., with 18 members, founded on Oct. 28, 1890, 1st chairman mill owner Hch. Gregory. Secretary Gom.=Lebter Dr. Suchier, Treasurer Fabrikdirekter Wilh. Daur; - Arnstadt, with 15 members, founded on October 29, 1890, 1st Chairman Major Witicke; - Gollnow, with 24 members, founded on November 4, 1890, 1st Chairman Captain Gallus, 2nd Chairman Superintendent Schultz, 1st Secretary Pastor Erdmann, 2nd Secretary Attorney Dunker, Treasurer Pastor Ziemer; - Calbe a. S., founded on November 6, 1890, chairman Pastor Reinhardt, secretary and treasurer factory owner Nicolat, assessor Dr. Maaß. The formation of the Adteilungsbildung in Gleiwig is imminent. Mr. Mayor Kreidel has thankfully taken over the preparations. It is a pleasant duty for us to take this opportunity to express our warmest thanks to these gentlemen for their commendable work in support of our endeavors. - Berlin Department. At the gentlemen's evening, which opened the series of lectures in the Architektenhaus on November 3 under the chairmanship of Prof. v. Cuny, editor Meinecke gave a lecture on "The Distribution of Africa". The speaker first discussed the extensive colonial system, which requires the widest possible expansion of the trading area and control of the widely ramified waterways, and then demonstrated that England had gained the greatest influence on the fate of this part of the world through its development. In a historical development, he then illuminated in detail the processes that led to the division of Africa in modern times, beginning with the South African aspirations of the English towards the Boers and dealt in particular with the Swaziland concession and its presumed influence on the position of the English and Boers, but especially the Afrikaner Bund and its tendencies. Touching briefly on the Anglo-German and Franco-English agreements, he spoke in detail about the situation in Cameroon, into whose hinterland the French were making attempts to penetrate and whose northern border had to be protected against the English. Characteristic of the activities of the French was their endeavor to reduce the Spanish enclave between the Cameroon region and Gabon more and more by concluding treaties with the chiefs of the hinterland. He considered the demarcations between England and France in Sudan to be of little use for the time being, as the French had not yet understood how to develop the Senegal colony, and expressed his opinion that the caravan traffic, supported by an intelligent trade policy of the states interested in the coast, would always move from Sudan to the nearest coastal areas, so that even if the interior were to be nominally brought under French sovereignty, the conditions in the Gulf of Benin would probably be little changed by this. In any case, England had managed to secure the lion's share; three huge British empires had been founded or at least diplomatically secured in the short space of five years. One in East Africa, in connection with Agppten, extended uninterruptedly through the eastern Sudan to Suakim and Alexandria; a second, in connection with the Cape Colony, stretched across the Sawdesi to Lake Tanganyika and the upper Kengo; the third filled the Niger-Bennö basin as far as Lake Chad. These three empires together cover an area roughly equal to that of Europe. The conquest of Africa for civilization was worth the sweat of the nobles; it would perhaps be Europe's last great deed in this and the next century. An incalculable field of endeavor in the service of morality and humanity was spreading to the coming generations - the cultural education of primitive peoples. At the first gentlemen's evening of the German Colonial Society in Dresden, at which Mr. F. Bley spoke about recent events in East Africa and the German-English agreement, the following telegram was sent at the request of Reichstag deputy br. Mehnert, it was decided to send the following telegram to Reich Chancellor v. Caprivi: "The Dresden branch of the German Colonial Association, assembled today, expresses its fullest confidence in Your Excellency's planned and resolute advocacy for the organization of our most promising colony and hopes that it will secure and evenly promote the economic forces interested in East Africa for the benefit of the Fatherland." In his telegram of thanks, Chancellor v. Caprivi said: "I, too, consider the East African colony to be a kingdom of the future and hope that the private capital necessary for its development and exploitation will soon turn to it."
Small notes. - (Emin Pasha's merits as a naturalist) Dr. G. Hartland sums up at the end of an article in the November issue of "Deutsche Revue" as follows: "1. Emin's research work has shed light on a large area of equatorial Africa that had previously been dark in terms of natural science. This applies in particular to ornithology. 2 Emin has paid particular attention to the well-known fact that Africa is the winter asylum for many migratory birds and has provided us with numerous notes relating to this. It may be a wonderful attraction to encounter the inconspicuous singers of our German homeland in this most remote area of the Jnnern, alongside the colorful figures of the glossy starlings, the capitonids and rectarinids. 3 Emin's research trip to Monduttu led to the surprising discovery that the fauna of this country has a strongly predominant western character. It should be mentioned that during Fischer's last trip it turned out that the entire area of the Viktoria Nyanza belongs to the western Fanna 4. In particular, we owe Emin Pasha a large number of valuable notes on the way of life of the animals he observed. This applies in particular to the birds. The most difficult questions, such as discoloration, the gradations and changes in coloration influenced by sex, age, climate, food and season, etc., etc., occupy him the most. He does not rest until he reaches certain results. 5 Emin makes every effort to systematically identify the animals he collects with the help of the literary material available to him. The fact that he does not always succeed in doing this correctly is only due to the incompleteness of the material. A highly deplorable shortcoming, but one that Wadelai found difficult to remedy. His perpetual whining for books is explainable enough. The most annoying thing is that the calalogs of the British Museum, which are indispensable for systematists, have only now become accessible to him. The lack of scientific works, from which Emin Pasha suffered, was also quite noticeable during his new expedition into the interior and prompted the German Colonial Society to provide relief, at least as far as botanical works were concerned. A number of important botanical works, in bindings specially designed for the troves, have recently been sent to the meritorious explorer as a sign of homage from the German Colonial Society (A decree concerning privileges for entrepreneurs in Cameroon), which was issued by the governor last year, is only now becoming known. It reads: "On the basis of the law concerning the legal status of the German protectorates, the imperial governor decrees as follows: §1. those who take steps in the protectorate of Cameroon to extract, manufacture or process objects which have not previously been exported from the protectorate may, if this appears useful for the improvement of trade or culture, be granted an exclusive right to the extraction, utilization and export of those objects §. (2) A person who establishes a settlement in areas of the protectorate where whites have not previously settled and thereby opens up new parts of the territory to local trade may be granted an exclusive right to trade within these parts of the territory in the sense that trading establishments of third parties there are excluded. The boundaries of the territory to which this authorization applies shall be determined by the imperial governorate. §3. the rights mentioned in §§ 1 and 2 shall be granted for a maximum period of 10 years. The conferral may be subject to conditions. The rights granted may be revoked without compensation if this is necessary in the interests of the protected areas. Applications for the granting of the rights in question shall be submitted in writing to the imperial governorate in Cameroon, stating the circumstances in question. §4. the right is reserved to pay a special patent fee for the granting of the rights referred to in §§ 1 and 2. This fee shall not exceed 5 percent of the value of the goods exported from the territory in the privileged industrial and commercial operations. §5. third parties who act contrary to the exclusively granted authorizations shall be punished with a fine of up to 3,000 marks, subject to the damages to be paid." It is said that eight privileges have been issued so far. We will return to this subject as soon as more detailed information is available. - (The French and the Royal Niger Company.) While the disputes over the Hönigsberg case were being fought out between the Germans and the English, the French press had stood by and waited, if not for the feeling of schadenfreude that the French company had merged with the English company at the right time. It seems, however, that a turnaround is now in the offing, as the Royal Niger Company is using the same tactics against the agent of the French Benito syndicate as it did against Hönigsberg. This agent, Mizon, who was previously active on the Ogowe and also accompanied Brazza, has telegraphed to the syndicate that the Roval Niger Company wants to facilitate his journey for scientific purposes on the Niger as much as possible if he seeks official authorization for the same. The achievement of the commercial aims of his voyage was made impossible by the ban on going ashore for the purpose of renewing the supplies and fuel for the expedition. We should be surprised that the French

Page 291

government will use to enforce the freedom of navigation of the Niger, and what tricks the Roval Riger Company will use against it. As far as the commercial purposes of Mizon's expedition are concerned, however, he has been instructed to advance from Benné to Lake Shari and Lake Chad and to join up with the French expeditions coming from the south. Crampel has sailed up the Ubanghi and wants to break through to Lake Chad, while Fourneau is working on the Sanaa, parallel to Crampel, to penetrate our Cameroon hinterland! - (Captain Trivier), who is known to have crossed Africa from west to east, intends to travel the coasts of West Africa in order to establish trade links with France. He also wants to visit Angra Pequena, which he seems to assume is a regular port of call for steamships, and, as the "Rövue Française" reports, also the "island of Jchaboe, famous for its calcium phosphates". Tempi passati. The guano deposits on Jchaboe Island have long been exhausted. (Collegia on colonial policy.) The note in no. 23 d. The note in No. 23 of this sheet on the lectures by Professor v. Stengel in Würzburg on German colonial law gives us cause to point out, as we are told, that at the University of Leipzig Professor Dr. Hasse has already been teaching a course on colonial policy - especially German policy - for two years, a course which is attended by over 100 students from all faculties every single semester. It would go too far to describe the rich content of these lectures in detail here, but the high attendance proves how timely the subject is and what lively, ongoing interest it meets in the circles of students, some of whom will certainly be called upon in the future to make practical use of what they have learned here. It would be highly desirable if lectures of this kind were held at all our universities; the colonial cause could only gain from this. - At the University of Breslau this semester, Professor Dr. W. Sombart is teaching a (weekly) two-hour course on "Trade and Colonial Policy" - (The Colonial Budget of France) for 1890, the expenditure can be estimated at around 36 million marks. However, this amount does not seem too high when one considers that the traffic between France and its colonies keeps 600 French ships with 400,000 tons in operation, since France's exports to the colonies amount to 70 million francs, and that it imports 135 million colonial products annually on which the state levies a tax of 50 million francs. In the budget for 1891, the revenue from customs duties on French colonial sugar alone amounts to 34,781,000 francs. - (East Africa.) The Colonial Gazette publishes a decree concerning the rubber trade in East Africa, in which the sale and purchase of rubber adulterated by the coarse addition of sand, stones, pieces of cattle or the like, obviously calculated to deceive, is prohibited. - The Colonial Gazette publishes some notes on the situation in East Africa. In Tanga, the barracks and the powder magazine are still under construction, while conditions in Saadani are developing satisfactorily. In response to a categorical request, Bana Heri has promised to settle in Saadani within two months. In Bagamoyo, caravan traffic was insignificant, a slave raider Jbrahim was caught and hanged. A new station is founded in Masinde, headed by Lieutenant Stenzler. The deputy station chief of Mywaywa, de la Fremoire, has punished some robber Wahehe= villages. In Dar=esSalaam, the construction and erection of magazines is being worked on diligently. The first of the three main chiefs of Kilwa, Muini Makierani, has returned after long negotiations and has moved back into the old quarters. The expansion of the stations there and in Lindi and Mikindaui is making progress. Lindi will soon be occupied by a small garrison. The hinterland of Lindi and Mikindani still leaves much to be desired in terms of orderly conditions and Dr. Schmidt intends to undertake an expedition there from Lindi, whereby it should also be determined whether there are coal seams on the left bank of the Rovuma. - The expedition from Stokes to Tabora is making good progress. - (From Witu.) The punishment for the murder of the Germans has been carried out by the English in a prompt and thorough manner. The English Admiral Fremantle had gone with the squadron to Kipini and had proceeded from there to attack the town of Witu, which was conquered and burned to the ground. A reward of 10,000 rupees was offered for the capture of the fugitive sultan. - The Reichsanzeiger (Imperial Gazette) has provided various other documents about the murder of the Küngel expedition, but these could not provide anything new or factual about the cause and course of the sad events. We have received a longer letter from Witu, which has also been largely overtaken by events, but we still share the concluding sentences from it: "It was an unfortunate coincidence for Küntzel and his companions that the protectorate over Witn was recently ceded by Germany to England, that this unfortunate slave liberation proclamation by Seid Ali was also recently announced by the English in the Lamn customs house, and that Küntzel recently gave up his German citizenship. The English were as suspicious of the Witn people as the sin itself - the treatment that the people s. Z. in the Beledsoni question made their blood boil even then, and all that was far from forgotten. Moreover, the people know - or at least firmly believe - that the English are after their slaves, and the slave proclamations that have recently been announced everywhere were and remain a kind of declaration of war for the entire population. If everything has apparently remained quiet in the towns on the coast up to now, it is only for fear of the cannons of the warships. But out of range - there the people still feel strong and will fight or die against the innovations; not only the various chiefs on the coast but also the inhabitants of the coastal towns are in complete agreement about this. The people in Lamn, for example, were unable to provoke anything in response to the prayerful proclamations here for the reason mentioned above, nor could they take an active part in the war against the Caucasians, but they openly show their sympathy for the cause and pray diligently in the mosques that God may grant them victory and drive all the Kasiri out of their country. It is a curious phenomenon that all the slaves stand together as one man, water in hand, against their so-called liberators, the Europeans. - When the Witn=Sultan heard that Kungzel was no longer a German on his return, but told them himself that he had been on a show with the English, it was clear to the Witu= people that Künzel was in the service of the English, coming on their behalf to bring all the monstrosities: steam engines, sawmills, etc., the like of which they had never seen, which they had never seen before, into the country, but which were nothing more than tools of destruction with which their forests (their protection) were first to be razed, more convenient paths made to Witu and with which they themselves were then to be fought. - Therefore, I maintain that if Witu had still been under German protection, or if the slave proclamation in the Lamu customs house had been omitted and Küngel had remained a German subject, then the Witu people would at least have let themselves be reasoned with and not immediately made war to the knife. The German people owed much, if not everything, to the Germans, and they thought - or believed - that they had nothing to fear from them, but rather hoped to find protection from them against the English and their endeavors, which they began to fear and hate. (The German Colonial Calendar for 1891), which will appear in a beautiful layout at the end of November, will be expanded in that a special section has been set up for the Protestant and Catholic missions active in the colonies and greater attention has been paid to the statistics of the colonies. In addition to all bookshops, orders are also accepted by L. v. Trautvetters Verlag, Körnerstraße 15, Berlin. (A remarkable statement on the necessity of colonies can be found in the November issue of the "Deutsche Rundschau" in an article in which Professor Dr. Ernst Häckel describes his memories in Algiers. He considers the eastern Mediterranean coast to be particularly important for German immigration in the future, and he hopes that Germany and Austria will want to lay their hands on it in the event of a future division of Turkey. The author then writes: "No one can say how the powerful colonial movement, which has been growing with surprising energy for a decade, will develop in the future and how the division of the earth among the great cultural nations of Europe will take place. One thing already seems clear: Germany can only assert its rightful position as a sovereign and independent power if it pursues its colonial policy with energetic perseverance, and we need fertile agricultural colonies to which the surplus of our steadily increasing population can emigrate, as well as well-situated trading colonies in which our world trade can find firm bases and our fleet good coal stations ... It would not occur to me to conclude my "Algerian Memoirs" with these colonial-political considerations if I were not convinced, on the basis of thirty years of observation and numerous journeys in three parts of the world, that the great colonial question is a matter of life and death for Germany. Every German citizen who sincerely loves his fatherland must constantly bear in mind that, as a result of our geographical position and distant development, the position of the new German Empire in Europe is the most perilous and its "struggle for existence" with the other nations of Europe the most difficult. The struggle for existence alone is the great real principle which regulates and determines the existence and development of the organic world, both in the competition of peoples and in the competition of animals and plants. With the increasing overpopulation of Europe and the sieve-like development of modern civilization, however, the question of emigration and the colonial policy connected with it is gaining an importance as never before. Germany, like Italy, is one of those overpopulated countries that lose thousands of its poorest people to foreign countries every year. With the cosmopolitan tendencies of our people and the shallow depth of German national feeling, these soon merge with the foreign element. If these valuable forces are invested in German agricultural and trading colonies, they will serve to strengthen and firmly support the German mother country instead of being lost to it. We are certainly not lacking in talent for colonization. A colony like Algeria would enhance our world position and national strength in an invaluable way. Germany can envy France for the possession of such a jewel as well as for its developed national feeling. This conviction remains one of the most powerful impressions of my journey through Algeria."

After the first attempt in 1886, a completely unique work of great importance has been created here. The following points of view were decisive for its editing. The aim was to provide a brief description of the historical development of the existing facilities and those to be completed with the customs connection and to provide as much detailed information as possible for the practical needs of shipping, trade and industry. For this purpose, the material has been divided into three main sections, the first of which

Page 292


 The first section deals with the general trade and transportation facilities of the rhedery, the banking system, the customs connection, the merchandise fund, insurance, forwarding and export business, the wine trade, the brewery, the arts and crafts and industry in Hamburg, as well as the German colonies and the consular system abroad, while the second is devoted to the details of Hamburg's industrial and artistic achievements and the third to the extremely important export agency business and the export sample warehouses. A general appendix of advertisements and a three-part index, comprising no less than 10 pages, form the conclusion. The individual articles have been edited by experts in the field. Extensive indexes facilitate the use of the book, the layout of which must be considered exemplary. We would not fail to draw the attention of those involved to this excellent work. A. Seidel. Entrances for the library. Given the limited space we have for book reviews, it will not be possible to discuss all works in detail, but we never fail to recommend new colonial writings, which are assigned to our library by the authors and publishers, to colonial friends in word and deed, for which the administration of the library will be given ample opportunity by our members. We hereby once again express our sincere thanks for the books donated to our library. Receipts in November. Actes de la Conférence de Bruxelles 1869/20 gr. fol. 708 P. Hayes. Bruxelles 1850.
